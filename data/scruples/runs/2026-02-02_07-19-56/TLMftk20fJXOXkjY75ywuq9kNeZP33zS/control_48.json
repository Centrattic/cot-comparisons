I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I'll read through the scenario carefully. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with their girlfriend, who previously was in a 5-year same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual. The author is upset that she wants to attend Gay Pride events, feeling it erases their relationship and makes her seem still gay. The girlfriend got upset, saying she can't be fully accepted in either community now and that her bisexuality is still valid. The author compares it to if she were in a same-sex relationship and went to straight events, but there's a difference in context here.\n\nNow, breaking down the key points. The author isn't homophobic, but they're uncomfortable with their girlfriend's participation in Pride events. The girlfriend is bisexual, so her attraction to women is part of her identity. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the LGBT community, and many people in the community maintain their identity regardless of their current relationship. \n\nThe author's issue seems to be about how others might perceive their girlfriend's attendance. They think she's not part of the LGBT community anymore because she's in a heterosexual relationship. However, bisexuality is a valid part of the LGBT spectrum, and someone's community participation doesn't necessarily change based on their current relationship status. The girlfriend is expressing her pride in her identity, which is a personal right. \n\nThe author is essentially asking if their girlfriend should have to \"choose\" between her identity and their relationship. The comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight bars is a bit different because in that case, the couple is not part of the straight community. But here, the girlfriend is part of the LGBT community by her own identity, even if she's in a hetero relationship now. \n\nThe author's statement about privileges is also a point. They mention straight privileges and LGBT community support, but the girlfriend is in a heterosexual relationship, which does come with certain societal privileges. However, her bisexuality is a part of her that doesn't disappear just because she's with a man. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is a key factor. She had a breakdown, which the author says is out of character. This suggests the issue might be more about her identity and past experiences than just a disagreement. The author's demand that she not go to Pride might be seen as invalidating her bisexuality and her right to participate in a community that's important to her. \n\nAlso, the author is implying that her participation in Pride is inauthentic because she's in a heterosexual relationship. But bisexuality is about attraction, not relationship status. Even if she's with a guy now, her attraction to women is still valid, and she can support the community without being in a same-sex relationship. \n\nI think the author is not considering that their girlfriend's identity is separate from her current relationship. By asking her not to go to Pride, they might be trying to control her expression of identity, which is a red flag in relationships. The girlfriend is making a point that she can't choose to not be part of the community just for the author's comfort. \n\nSo, the author's position might be based on insecurity rather than understanding her partner's identity. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. Since the author's stance is conflicting with their girlfriend's identity and right to participate in a community that's significant to her, they're likely the asshole here. The answer should be A.\n"
