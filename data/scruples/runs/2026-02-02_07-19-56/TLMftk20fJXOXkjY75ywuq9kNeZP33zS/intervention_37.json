I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The author is a man in a heterosexual relationship with a girlfriend who previously was in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual. The conflict arises when the author objects to his girlfriend attending Gay Pride events, arguing that since she's in a heterosexual relationship now, she's not part of the LGBT community anymore. The girlfriend is upset, feeling that her identity is erased and that her bisexuality is being denied.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is not homophobic but is uncomfortable because his girlfriend's attendance at Pride events seems to conflict with their current relationship status. He feels it's erasing their relationship and that she's acting as if she's still gay. The girlfriend, on the other hand, emphasizes her bisexuality, her support for the community, and the importance of Pride as a space for her identity, especially after being outcasted before.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The author's main argument is that because his girlfriend is in a straight relationship now, she shouldn't participate in Pride events. But bisexuality is about attraction to both genders, not necessarily current relationship status. The author's objection seems to stem from insecurity about her not being \"fully straight\" now, which could be a form of invalidating her identity. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that her bisexuality is a core part of her identity, regardless of her current partner. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the LGBT community, which includes bisexual individuals. By attending, she's asserting her identity and supporting others. The author's stance might be seen as erasing her identity, as he's suggesting she must choose between her current relationship and her past/potential attractions. \n\nAdditionally, the author compares it to a lesbian couple attending straight bars, which could be a fair analogy. If a lesbian in a same-sex relationship attended straight events, it might raise similar insecurities. However, the key difference is that the girlfriend is openly bisexual and the author is questioning her right to be part of both communities. \n\nThe author's comment about not wanting her to be around other gay women who might assume she's gay could be seen as controlling or not trusting her. The girlfriend's breakdown and mention of needing to \"be straight\" to satisfy his insecurities highlight that the author's stance is making her feel like she has to deny part of herself. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people argue that one's identity isn't contingent on their current relationship status. Bisexual individuals can be in any relationship but still identify as bi. Pride events are inclusive of the entire LGBT spectrum, including bisexuals. The author's resistance might be based on a misunderstanding or a need for validation of his own straight identity, which isn't fair to his girlfriend. \n\nHowever, the author isn't against the LGBT community per se; he supports Gay Pride but is conflicted about his girlfriend's participation. His feelings are valid in terms of personal discomfort, but they shouldn't override her right to express her identity. The fact that the argument led to her storming out and him questioning if he's the asshole suggests that his approach might be problematic. \n\nIn summary, the author's main issue is that he's invalidating his girlfriend's bisexuality by tying her identity to her current relationship status. This can be seen as erasing her true self and not respecting her right to participate in communities that are important to her. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
