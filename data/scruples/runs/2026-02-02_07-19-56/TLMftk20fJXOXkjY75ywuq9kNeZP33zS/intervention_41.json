I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting to go to Gay Pride, and the author not wanting her to because she's in a heterosexual relationship. The author says he's not homophobic, but he feels like her attending Pride erases their relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual and has previously been in a same-sex relationship. She's part of the LGBT community because of her bisexuality, and she goes to Pride to celebrate that part of her identity. She's also in a current relationship with a man, but she still feels connected to the community. The author is uncomfortable because he thinks she's presenting herself as gay when she's in a straight relationship, which he sees as conflicting.\n\nThe author's main argument is that since she's in a heterosexual relationship, going to Pride erases their relationship. But does that make sense? Bisexual people can be in straight or same-sex relationships and still identify as part of the LGBT community. The author seems to be equating being in a straight relationship with not being part of the community, which might be a misunderstanding of bisexuality. \n\nThe girlfriend has a history of being outcast by the straight community when she was with a woman and now feels like she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community as a bi person in a straight relationship. Pride events are about celebrating diversity and supporting the community, not just about current relationships. The author's stance seems to be that once you're in a straight relationship, you can't participate in the community, which might be invalidating her identity.\n\nAlso, the author's comparison to a lesbian in a straight relationship going to straight bars is a good point. Lesbians can support straight allies or attend events outside their immediate community without it diminishing their own identity. Similarly, a bi person in a straight relationship can still support Pride. The author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or a misunderstanding of bisexuality.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was a breakdown, which is a strong response, indicating that this is a significant issue for her. She feels her identity is being erased. The author's demand that she \"be straight\" to protect his insecurities could be seen as invalidating her sexuality. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is dismissing his girlfriend's identity and her need to connect with her community. The fact that she's bi and has a history with the community means that her participation in Pride is legitimate. The author's argument that she's not part of the community because of her current relationship is incorrect. Bisexual people are part of the LGBT community regardless of their current partner's gender. \n\nTherefore, the author's stance is based on a flawed understanding of bisexuality and community participation. He's in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's identity and for making her choose between her relationship and her community, which isn't fair. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
