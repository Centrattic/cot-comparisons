I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend a gay pride event. The situation is that the girlfriend is bisexual, was previously in a same-sex relationship, and wants to go to Pride again even though she's now in a heterosexual relationship. The author feels that her attending Pride in this context is erasing their relationship and making him feel insecure. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels her identity is being erased and is upset because he's not respecting her bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author isn't homophobic, which is a good start. The girlfriend is bi, so her attraction to both genders is part of her identity. Being in a relationship with a man doesn't erase her bisexuality. The author's main issue is that she's attending an event associated with the LGBTQ+ community while being in a straight relationship. But bisexuality is about attraction, not current relationship status. So, it's valid for her to identify as bi even if she's in a relationship with a man now.\n\nNext, the author's argument is that he doesn't want her to go to Pride because it makes him feel like her current relationship isn't enough. That seems like a personal insecurity. The girlfriend is passionate about the community and the cause, which is her right. The author is projecting his own discomfort onto her, possibly not understanding that her participation in Pride is about her identity and support for the community, not about her current relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown and her statement about needing to express her pride in her community's history is significant. If she's part of the LGBTQ+ community, attending Pride should be a valid activity. The author's analogy about a female couple going to straight bars and events is interesting, but the key difference is that straight events are not about the community's history or identity. Pride is specifically about celebrating and supporting the LGBTQ+ community, so her presence aligns with her identity.\n\nAlso, the author's concern about her being at the event with other gay women who might assume she's still gay is based on a misunderstanding. Bisexual people are part of the LGBTQ+ community, so her attending Pride is appropriate. The author's comment about not being able to have both straight privileges and LGBTQ+ community support seems to conflate personal relationship status with broader identity and advocacy. People can be in different relationships while still supporting the community and its events.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author might not have expressed his feelings in a way that acknowledges her identity. The argument escalated because he focused on his insecurities rather than listening to her perspective. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that the issue is important to her, and the author dismissing her need to be part of the community could be seen as invalidating her identity.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong here because he's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and her right to participate in events that affirm her sexuality, even if he doesn't fully understand it. His jealousy or insecurity shouldn't dictate her participation in something that's meaningful to her. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
