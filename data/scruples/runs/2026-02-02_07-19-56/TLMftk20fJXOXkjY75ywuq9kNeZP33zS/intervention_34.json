I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a guy in a heterosexual relationship with his girlfriend, who is bi. She used to be in a same-sex relationship and now goes to Pride events annually. The author is upset because she's attending these events even though she's in a straight relationship now. He feels it erases their relationship and makes him uncomfortable. She's had a breakdown and left, saying he's making her be straight to protect his insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend identifies as bi, which means she's attracted to her own gender and others. Being bi doesn't mean she's in a same-sex relationship at all times. She's still part of the LGBTQ+ community, even if she's currently in a straight relationship. Pride events are about celebrating identity and community history, not about current relationship status.\n\nThe author's argument is that attending Pride as a bi person in a straight relationship is confusing or erasing their relationship. But bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation regardless of relationship status. She's not \"acting as if she's still gay\" because she's bi; her identity isn't negated by being in a straight relationship. The author's comparison to a straight woman going to straight bars might not hold because bisexuality is part of the LGBTQ+ spectrum, so attending Pride is part of her identity expression.\n\nThe author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or misunderstanding. His statement about \"privileges of a straight relationship\" and not wanting her to have \"LGBT community\" privileges at the same time suggests he might see her identity as a choice rather than an inherent part of who she is. That's problematic because sexual orientation isn't something one can switch on or off based on relationships.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable. Feeling that her identity is being erased or invalidated in a relationship is hurtful. She's part of the bi community and has a right to celebrate and support her community. The author is asking her to deny part of her identity to make him more comfortable, which is unfair.\n\nAlso, the author mentions she said she's not straight just because she's with a guy. Insisting that she must be in a same-sex relationship to be considered part of the community is incorrect. Bisexual people are part of the LGBTQ+ community regardless of their current partner's gender.\n\nSo, the author is invalidating his girlfriend's identity and her right to participate in events important to her community. Even if his intentions are to protect his insecurities, it's not acceptable to demand that she hide part of who she is. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
