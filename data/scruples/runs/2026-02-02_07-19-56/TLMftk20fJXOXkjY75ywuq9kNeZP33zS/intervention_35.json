I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. The situation is that the girlfriend previously identified as gay but now is in a heterosexual relationship with him. She still identifies as bisexual and wants to go to Pride events. The author feels it's erasing their relationship because she's in a straight relationship now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of the situation. The girlfriend is bi, which means she can be attracted to more than one gender. Her going to Pride events doesn't necessarily mean she's not committed to her current relationship. The author seems to view bisexuality as a fixed identity that requires being in a same-gender relationship, which isn't accurate. Bisexuality is about attraction, not current relationship status.\n\nThe author's argument is that if his girlfriend were in a same-gender relationship and went to straight events, that would be similar. But that's a different scenario. The key point here is about the girlfriend's identity. Even if she's in a heterosexual relationship, her bisexuality is a valid part of her identity. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the LGBTQ+ community, not just those in same-gender relationships. So, the author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or misunderstanding about bisexuality and the purpose of Pride events.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown suggests that this issue is significant to her. She feels that the author is invalidating her identity and forcing her to choose between communities. The author's stance could be seen as erasing her bisexuality by not acknowledging that she can be part of both the straight and LGBTQ+ communities. The author might be conflating her participation in Pride with her current relationship status, which isn't the same thing.\n\nAlso, the author mentions supporting gay pride but finding it hurtful. This contradiction could indicate that he's not fully understanding the purpose of Pride, which is about inclusivity and support for all LGBTQ+ individuals, regardless of their current relationships. The girlfriend's participation is about her identity and advocacy, not about being unfaithful or invalidating their relationship.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author's approach might have been confrontational. Instead of expressing his feelings without judgment, he might have made her feel that her identity is a problem. The girlfriend's reaction highlights that this is a sensitive issue for her, and the author's response could have been more empathetic.\n\nIn summary, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's bisexuality and her right to participate in Pride events. His focus on her current relationship status overlooks the complexity of her identity. The girlfriend's need to express her identity and support her community is valid, and the author's reaction seems based on insecurity and misunderstanding rather than legitimate concerns about the relationship.\n"
