I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding his girlfriend wanting to attend Gay Pride. The author is in a heterosexual relationship but identifies as bisexual. He's upset because she goes to Pride events even though she's not currently in a same-sex relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as gay. However, now she's in a hetero relationship but still feels a connection to the LGBTQ+ community. She argues that being bisexual means she's part of the community and wants to support the cause. The author feels that attending Pride might confuse her identity or erase their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about identity and inclusion. The author is struggling with the idea that his girlfriend can be part of the LGBTQ+ community while in a heterosexual relationship. However, bisexuality is an orientation, not just about current relationships. So, even if she's dating a guy now, her sexual orientation still allows her to identify as bisexual and participate in Pride events. \n\nThe author's argument that she's not \"gay\" until she's in a gay relationship seems to misunderstand bisexuality. It's about attraction to multiple genders, not the current relationship status. The girlfriend's need to express her identity and connect with the community is valid. The author's insecurity might stem from feeling threatened by her participation in events that are for the LGBTQ+ community, which is her right regardless of her current relationship.\n\nThe breakdown in communication is clear. The author's main issue is about her presence in the community while in a straight relationship, but that's not about erasing their relationship; it's about her personal identity. The girlfriend's reaction shows the emotional impact of his words, possibly making her feel like her identity is being denied. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's feelings are understandable, but his perspective might be invalidating his girlfriend's identity. The core issue is about respecting her self-identified bisexuality and her right to participate in Pride events without being forced to deny her past or current identity. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not supporting her participation and for making her feel her identity is contingent on her current relationship status.\n"
