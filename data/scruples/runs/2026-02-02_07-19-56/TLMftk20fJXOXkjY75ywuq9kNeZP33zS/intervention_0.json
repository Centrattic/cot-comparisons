I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to attend Gay Pride while they're in a heterosexual relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a 3-year relationship with a girlfriend who identifies as bisexual. She was previously in a 5-year lesbian relationship but now is with a guy. She wants to go to Pride again this year. The author is uncomfortable with this because he feels it erases their current relationship and that she's not part of the LGBT community anymore since she's in a hetero relationship. The girlfriend is upset, feeling that the author is invalidating her sexuality.\n\nSo the main points: The author's issue is with his girlfriend attending Pride events given their current relationship status. The girlfriend argues she's still part of the LGBT community as a bisexual person and wants to support the cause. The author compares it to a same-sex couple in a straight bar, implying it's inconsistent. The girlfriend is now upset and left.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. The author is questioning whether someone in a heterosexual relationship can still be part of the LGBT community. The girlfriend's identity isn't changing just because she's in a relationship with a man. Bisexual people can be in straight relationships and still identify with the LGBT community. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the community, regardless of current relationship status.\n\nThe author's argument that she's not \"gay until she's in a gay relationship\" might be invalidating her bisexuality. Bisexual people are part of the LGBT community regardless of their current partner. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple going to straight events isn't quite the same because the context and community belonging are different. The author might be projecting his insecurities onto her actions, as he mentioned.\n\nThe girlfriend's point about feeling erased by the straight and LGBT communities is important. She's navigating her identity in a space where she might feel marginalized on both sides. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissing her valid need to connect with her community and her ongoing identity as bisexual.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it seems like he's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and community ties. His argument is based on the idea that her participation in Pride negates their relationship, which might not be a fair assumption. The key here is that the author is imposing his discomfort onto her right to express her identity. The girlfriend's feelings of being erased and invalidated are significant, and the author's response might be causing unnecessary harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's bisexuality and her right to participate in Pride events as part of her identity, regardless of her current relationship status.\n"
