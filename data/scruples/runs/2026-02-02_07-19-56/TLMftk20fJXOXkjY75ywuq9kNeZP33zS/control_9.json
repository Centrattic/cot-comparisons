I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a relationship with a girlfriend who was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual. The girlfriend wants to go to Pride events again, but the author is upset about it, feeling like she's erasing their relationship or not fully embracing being straight now. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She mentioned that when she was with a woman, she was outcasted by the straight community. Now, she's in a heterosexual relationship but still feels a connection to the LGBT community because of her bisexuality. Bisexual people can feel a part of both the straight and LGBT communities, but sometimes they're excluded from both. She sees Pride as a way to support the community and express her identity.\n\nThe author's issue is that he believes once someone is in a heterosexual relationship, they are considered straight and shouldn't participate in LGBT events. He compares it to if he were in a female-female relationship and his girlfriend went to straight bars. But bisexuality is about attraction to both genders, not necessarily current relationship status. So, even if she's in a straight relationship, her identity as bisexual might still make her feel connected to the LGBT community. \n\nThe author's reasoning seems to stem from insecurity, thinking she wants to explore other sides or isn't committed. However, the girlfriend has stated she's monogamous and committed. His argument that she can't have the privileges of both communities might be invalidating her identity. \n\nAlso, the breakdown she had suggests that this is a sensitive issue for her, possibly tied to her past experiences of being excluded. The author dismissing her need to participate in Pride could be seen as not respecting her identity. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's identities is crucial. The author is supporting LGBT rights in general but is uncomfortable with his partner participating in events she identifies with. It might be about his own feelings of jealousy or insecurity rather than the actual validity of her participation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and the importance of Pride to her, based on her past and current identity as a bisexual person. His comparison to straight bars in a same-sex relationship isn't accurate because the context is different\u2014bisexuality is part of the LGBT community regardless of current relationship orientation. The answer should be A.\n"
