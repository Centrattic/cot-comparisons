I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend gay pride events. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the author's perspective and his girlfriend's. The author is in a heterosexual relationship with a woman who previously identified as gay but now says she's bi, having only dated women before. Now in a relationship with him, he feels uncomfortable with her attending Pride events because she's in a straight relationship and not part of the LGBT community anymore. He sees it as erasing their relationship and acting as if she's still gay. He also brings up potential insecurities about her being around other women.\n\nThe girlfriend's side is that she still identifies as bi, even though she's in a hetero relationship. She feels a connection to the LGBT community because of her past and the challenges she faced being outcast by both straight and LGBT communities. She values Pride as a time to celebrate her identity and support the community, even if her current relationship is with a man. She's upset that her partner is questioning her sexuality and making her feel like she has to be straight to fit his comfort.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's issue seems to stem from insecurity. He's not necessarily homophobic, as he mentions he supports gay rights, but he's projecting his discomfort onto his partner's identity. He's asking her to choose between her past and her current relationship, which isn't fair. People can have fluid identities and still participate in communities related to their past. Being in a straight relationship doesn't erase someone's sexuality, especially if they identify as bi. \n\nHe also compares it to a lesbian couple attending straight events, but that's not the same. The girlfriend is still part of the bi community, which is part of the broader LGBT spectrum. His argument that she's not gay now because she's not in a same-sex relationship is a bit simplistic. Sexual orientation isn't solely determined by current relationship status. Even if she's in a hetero relationship, her attraction to both genders is part of her identity.\n\nThe girlfriend's emotional response\u2014storming out and talking about not seeing a future\u2014suggests that the author's comments deeply hurt her. She feels erased and invalidated. The author's approach seems to be about his own insecurities rather than a genuine understanding of her identity. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is imposing his discomfort onto his partner's right to express her identity. The girlfriend's participation in Pride is about her personal history and support for the community, not about disloyalty. The author's refusal to accept her bisexuality in the context of their relationship is problematic. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's identities, and the author isn't showing that here. He's demanding she conform to his expectations rather than accepting her as she is.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his partner's identity and is projecting his insecurities onto her, causing conflict and hurt.\n"
