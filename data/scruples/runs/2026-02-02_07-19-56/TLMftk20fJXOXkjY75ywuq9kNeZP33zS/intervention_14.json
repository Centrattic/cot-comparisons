I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether it's acceptable for the girlfriend to attend Gay Pride events while being in a heterosexual relationship. The author is not homophobic and supports people being who they are, but he's upset because the girlfriend is now in a straight relationship and still wants to go to Pride.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She identifies as bisexual, which means she's attracted to both genders. She's in a happy relationship with the author, but she still wants to participate in Pride for the community and support the cause. She felt ostracized by the straight community when she was with a woman, so Pride is a way for her to feel part of a community that has faced challenges. She's not denying her bisexuality, just in a relationship with a man now.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be that he feels her attending Pride erases their relationship. He's comparing it to a hypothetical where a lesbian partner goes to straight bars, which he sees as similar. But the key difference here is bisexuality. Since the girlfriend is bi, she's part of the LGBTQ+ community regardless of her current partner. Bisexual individuals can be part of the community and support events like Pride even when in a heterosexual relationship. \n\nThe author is making the argument that she can't have the privileges of a straight relationship and still be part of the LGBTQ+ community. But that's a false dichotomy. People can belong to multiple communities and support causes they care about without exclusive membership. The girlfriend is not denying her current relationship; she's maintaining her identity and support for her community. \n\nHe also mentions not wanting her to be seen as gay by others at Pride, which implies that her identity is contingent on her current relationship status. That's a problematic view because a person's sexual orientation isn't determined by who they're currently dating. Being bisexual is a valid orientation, and her participation in Pride doesn't negate her relationship with him.\n\nThe author might be feeling insecure or worried about jealousy, but that's not a valid reason to deny her right to support her community. The girlfriend's breakdown suggests that this is a significant issue for her, and the author's comments about \"erasing her sexuality\" are hurtful and invalidating. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, the answer would likely be A. He's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and her choice to support the community she's part of. Bisexual individuals often face erasure from both straight and LGBTQ+ communities, so it's important for their partners to support their participation in events like Pride. The author's stance is based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the nature of community belonging.\n"
