I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride while they're in a heterosexual relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author isn't homophobic, which is good. He's okay with his girlfriend being bi, but he's uncomfortable with her attending Pride events now that she's in a straight relationship. His main issue seems to be that he feels she's erasing their relationship by still identifying with the LGBT community. On the other hand, she feels that her bisexuality is part of her identity and that Pride is important for her community, especially after being outcasted by both straight and LGBT communities before.\n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone is attracted to more than one gender. The author argues that she's not \"gay\" until she's in a same-sex relationship, which might not be accurate. Being bi doesn't require being in a same-sex relationship to be part of the LGBT community. So, her identity isn't erased by being in a heterosexual relationship. She's still bi, which is part of the LGBT spectrum.\n\nThe author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or feeling that her presence at Pride could imply she's not fully committed to their relationship. But the girlfriend's perspective is about self-identity and community support, not about being unfaithful. She's expressing her sexuality, which is a personal right. The author might be projecting his insecurities onto her actions, which isn't fair.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014storming out and saying she can't see a future with him\u2014suggests that this issue is significant to her. The author's unwillingness to respect her identity and community ties could be a major point of contention. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's identities, even if they don't fully understand them.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not respecting her bisexuality and the importance of Pride events to her. His argument that she's not part of the community anymore because she's in a straight relationship is flawed. The key here is that sexual orientation is about attraction, not current relationship status. Therefore, the author's stance dismisses her identity, which is harmful.\n"
