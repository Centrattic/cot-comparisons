I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding their girlfriend going to Gay Pride events.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author is in a heterosexual relationship but identifies as bi, having been previously in a same-sex relationship. The author doesn't like that their girlfriend goes to Pride events now that she's in a straight relationship. They argue that it erases their relationship and that she's not part of the LGBT community anymore. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that her bisexuality is still valid and that attending Pride is important for her to connect with the community she once was part of. She also mentions feeling caught between two communities, which adds to the emotional weight here.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be about the girlfriend's identity and community involvement conflicting with their own feelings about the relationship. They compare it to a same-sex couple where one partner goes to straight bars, implying a similar discomfort. However, bisexuality is a valid orientation, and community events like Pride are inclusive of diverse identities. The author might be conflating the girlfriend's attendance at Pride with a rejection of their relationship, which isn't necessarily the case. The girlfriend is expressing her identity and support for a cause, which is her right.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings of insecurity and the fear of the girlfriend's attraction to others might be valid emotions, but they shouldn't override her right to express her identity. The key here is whether the author is respecting their girlfriend's bisexuality and community ties. The author's stance that she isn't \"truly\" part of the LGBT community unless in a same-sex relationship is problematic because bisexuality is recognized as part of the LGBT spectrum. Pride events are for all non-heteronormative identities, including bisexuals. The author's argument that attending Pride erases their relationship is a misunderstanding; it's about celebrating identity without negating current relationships.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown and the argument suggest that the author's approach was hurtful. Insisting she \"be straight\" to accommodate insecurities can be invalidating. Healthy relationships allow both partners to express their identities. The author might benefit from understanding that the girlfriend's participation in Pride is about her identity, not a rejection of their relationship. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events is a bit off because the contexts are different\u2014bisexual identity isn't erased by current relationship status. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because they're invalidating their girlfriend's identity and community involvement. Their discomfort stems from personal insecurities rather than respecting her right to be part of the community she identifies with. The healthy approach would be to support each other's identities and find a middle ground, rather than imposing restrictions based on personal feelings.\n"
