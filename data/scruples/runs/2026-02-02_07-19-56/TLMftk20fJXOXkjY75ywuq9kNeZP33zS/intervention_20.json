I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to unpack this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong regarding their girlfriend attending Gay Pride while they're in a heterosexual relationship. The author is not homophobic but feels hurt and erased because they see her participating in LGBT events as her still identifying as gay, even though she's in a straight relationship now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, which means she can be attracted to both genders. The author is arguing that if she's in a straight relationship, she shouldn't be part of the LGBT community anymore. But bisexuality doesn't require being in a relationship with a specific gender to still be part of the community. So the author's stance might be misunderstanding bisexuality.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that being bisexual is a part of her identity regardless of her current partner's gender. Going to Pride is about celebrating her identity and supporting the community. The author's comment about her \"expecting the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community\" could be seen as invalidating her identity. It's like saying she can't be part of the community if she's not currently in a same-sex relationship, which isn't how it works.\n\nAlso, the author compared it to a lesbian girlfriend going to straight bars. That seems like a flawed analogy because straight bars are for straight people, but Pride is a public event meant for the entire LGBT community. Participation isn't about current relationship status but about identity and solidarity. The author might be conflating public identity with private relationships here.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown suggests that this issue is deeply personal and sensitive for her. Feeling erased or invalidated can be really hurtful. The author's pushback in the relationship, especially leading to her storming out, indicates that their communication might not have been effective or respectful. Even if the author's intentions were to express their feelings, the way they presented it might not have considered the girlfriend's experiences and identity.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"bi-erasure,\" where bisexual individuals are told they're not part of the LGBT community until they're in a same-sex relationship. The author's comment might be contributing to that, which is a common criticism. The girlfriend is likely feeling that her identity is being dismissed, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe author mentions supporting gay pride but feels hurt. It's possible they're struggling with personal insecurities or a need for exclusivity in the relationship. However, the way they expressed their feelings, by essentially saying she can't have both the community she's part of and their relationship, is problematic. It's not about choosing one over the other; it's about understanding that her identity is fluid and valid regardless of her current relationship status.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they're misrepresenting their girlfriend's identity and not respecting her need to connect with her community. The girlfriend's actions don't negate their relationship, and the author's reaction may stem from a lack of understanding about bisexuality and the purpose of Pride events.\n"
