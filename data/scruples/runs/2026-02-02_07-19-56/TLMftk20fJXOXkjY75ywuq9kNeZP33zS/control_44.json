I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who identifies as bisexual, is in a heterosexual relationship, and wants to attend Pride events. The author is upset because they feel she's erasing their relationship by attending Pride, which is for the LGBT community.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author isn't homophobic and supports people being themselves. The girlfriend was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bi. The author's issue is that since she's in a heterosexual relationship now, attending Pride feels like she's still claiming to be part of the LGBT community, which he finds conflicting.\n\nThe author's main argument is about not wanting his girlfriend to be in a space typically associated with non-straight identities while being in a straight relationship. But bisexuality is a valid part of the LGBT community. Just because someone is in a heterosexual relationship doesn't mean they can't support or participate in Pride. The girlfriend's reasoning is that she's part of the bi community and wants to support the cause. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight bars might not be directly applicable because bi people are part of the LGBT community regardless of their current partner.\n\nThe author's statement about \"erasing their relationship\" might be invalidating his girlfriend's identity. If she's bisexual, her participation in Pride isn't about her current relationship but her inherent sexuality. The author's insecurity about her attending Pride could stem from not fully understanding bisexuality or feeling threatened. The girlfriend's breakdown and mention of being outcast by both communities highlight the importance of her participation for her identity and mental health.\n\nThe author's assertion that she isn't \"gay until she's in a gay relationship\" might be conflating bisexuality with being gay. Being bi doesn't require being in a same-sex relationship to be valid. The author's stance could be seen as excluding his girlfriend from her own identity, which is harmful. Supporting Pride doesn't mean one is not part of a straight relationship; it's about supporting equality and community. The author's reaction might be the problem here, as it's dismissing his partner's identity for his own comfort.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his perspective invalidates his girlfriend's bisexuality and her right to participate in events that affirm her identity, which is a core part of her being. His insecurity and the comparison might not hold, and his actions risk making her feel like she has to choose between her identity and their relationship.\n"
