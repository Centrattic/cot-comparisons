I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their girlfriend to go to Gay Pride. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a heterosexual relationship with a girlfriend who identifies as bisexual. She was previously in a same-sex relationship. The author is uncomfortable with her attending Gay Pride events, arguing that since she's in a straight relationship now, she's not part of the LGBT community anymore. The girlfriend feels that her bisexuality is part of her identity and that she needs to participate in Pride to connect with the community, despite her current relationship status.\n\nSo, the key points here are about identity, acceptance, and boundaries. The author's issue seems to stem from insecurity, thinking that her attending Pride erases their relationship. But bisexuality is about attraction to both genders, and her identity doesn't change just because she's in a straight relationship. The author is making her choose between her identity and their relationship, which is problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she's still part of the LGBT community because of her bisexuality. Pride events are about celebrating all identities, including bisexuals. The author's argument that she can't be part of both the straight and LGBT communities is a false dichotomy. Many people navigate multiple communities. Also, the author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight bars is flawed because the context and societal acceptance are different. Bisexual individuals often face erasure from both communities, so her need to attend Pride is about self-acceptance and community support.\n\nThe author's reaction led to a breakup, which suggests that the conflict is significant. The author's stance may be based on insecurity rather than understanding her identity. It's important to respect someone's self-identified labels and their need to participate in events that affirm their identity, even if the partner is uncomfortable. The author's demand that she \"be straight\" to accommodate his insecurities is controlling and dismissive of her true self.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they are invalidating their girlfriend's bisexuality and the importance of her participation in Pride events. They need to respect her identity and the reasons she finds value in those communities, even if it makes them uncomfortable.\n"
