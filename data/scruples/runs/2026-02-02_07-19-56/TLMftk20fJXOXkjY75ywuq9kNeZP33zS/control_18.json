I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that their girlfriend, who identifies as bisexual, wants to attend Gay Pride events even though she's in a heterosexual relationship. The author feels like she's erasing their relationship by participating in events they associate with the LGBTQ+ community, especially since she's not currently in a same-sex relationship. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that the author is invalidating her sexuality and making her \"be straight\" to protect his insecurities. She also mentions her need to connect with a community that once outcasted her when she was in a same-sex relationship.\n\nSo, where's the line here? The author claims to not be homophobic and supports the right to be oneself. But they're uncomfortable with their girlfriend's participation in Pride events because they see her as now being in a straight relationship. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, which means she's attracted to both genders. Her participation in Pride doesn't necessarily mean she's still in a same-sex relationship but rather that she still identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community. \n\nThe key points here are about identity versus relationship status. The author seems to conflate the two. Just because someone is in a different-sex relationship doesn't mean they can't be part of the LGBTQ+ community. Bisexuality is a valid orientation, and participating in Pride events is about supporting the community and its causes, not just one's current relationship status. The author's argument that she can't have both straight privileges and LGBTQ+ community support is a form of exclusion that's not fair. The girlfriend's feelings of being erased by the author's stance are valid because it dismisses her identity. \n\nAlso, the author's analogy about a female couple going to straight bars and pride events is flawed. The context is different because the events are about celebrating identity and community, not about current relationships. The author's insecurity might be leading him to invalidate her identity for the sake of his own comfort. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is not respecting his girlfriend's identity and the importance of her community. Even if he supports LGBTQ+ rights, his actions here are not supportive of her specific needs. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a response to feeling invalidated. The author's position is more about his own discomfort rather than a genuine understanding of her identity. \n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A). He's dismissing his girlfriend's bisexuality and her right to participate in events that affirm her identity, which is a core part of who she is. The argument about \"erasing\" their relationship is a misunderstanding of how identity and community affiliation work. The author needs to recognize that being in a straight relationship doesn't negate her bisexuality or her connection to the LGBTQ+ community.\n"
