I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend gay pride events. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author identifies as not homophobic and respects people's rights. His girlfriend was previously in a same-sex relationship and identifies as bisexual now. She goes to Pride events every year with friends, some gay, some straight. The author's issue is that she's in a heterosexual relationship now and feels that her attending Pride erases their relationship. The girlfriend sees it as important to her identity and community support, even though she's currently in a straight relationship.\n\nSo, key points here are about bisexual identity, the importance of community events, and the author's feelings of insecurity. The author thinks that since she's in a straight relationship, she shouldn't be part of the LGBT community anymore. But bisexuality is about attraction to multiple genders, not just current relationship status. The girlfriend's argument is that her sexuality isn't erased by her current partner, and she still feels connected to the community.\n\nThe author's argument that she can't have both straight privileges and LGBT community support seems flawed because bisexuality is a valid identity regardless of relationship status. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple going to straight events might not hold since the context is different. Pride events are about celebrating identity and history, not about current relationships.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown and storming out indicate the emotional weight of the issue for her. The author's stance might come across as dismissive of her identity and the community's significance to her. Also, the idea that attending Pride \"acts as if she is still gay\" could be seen as invalidating her bisexuality. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is making assumptions about what the community means to her and how her identity is expressed. The girlfriend has the right to support causes important to her, even if her current relationship is with someone of a different gender. The author's insecurity might be leading him to impose his views on her identity, which isn't fair. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
