I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who is a bisexual woman in a heterosexual relationship but still wants to attend Pride events. The author is upset because he feels she's erasing their relationship by participating in an event he associates with her previous gay identity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend was in a 5-year same-sex relationship, now in a heterosexual one. She's bi, so she's attracted to both genders but is currently with a man. The author is okay with her being bi but is uncomfortable with her attending Pride. He feels it's contradictory because she's in a straight relationship now, so why support the gay community? The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels this is important for her identity and community support, and she's facing judgment from both straight and LGBT communities.\n\nThe author argues that she can't have the privileges of both communities. The girlfriend counters that her bisexuality is still valid, and Pride is about supporting the broader LGBT community, not just those currently in same-sex relationships. He compares it to a lesbian in a straight relationship going to straight bars, but that's a different scenario. The key here is that bisexuality is a valid orientation, and participation in Pride doesn't negate her current relationship.\n\nThe author's discomfort might stem from insecurity or a misunderstanding of bisexuality. Bisexual people can be in monogamous, long-term relationships and still support the community. Pride is about solidarity and history, not just current relationship status. The author's argument that she's \"not gay until she's in a gay relationship\" overlooks the fact that identity isn't just about current relationships but also personal orientation.\n\nThe girlfriend's breakdown and storming out indicate that this is a significant emotional issue for her. The author's insistence that she should be \"straight\" now could be invalidating her identity. The fact that she's still bi and part of the community, even in a straight relationship, is a valid perspective. The author's stance might be projecting his insecurities onto her identity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like he's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and the importance of her community. He's making her feel like she has to choose between her past and present, which is not fair. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
