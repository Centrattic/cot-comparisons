I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author isn't homophobic but is upset because his girlfriend, who identifies as bisexual, wants to go to Gay Pride. She was previously in a same-sex relationship but is now in a heterosexual one. The author's main issue is that he feels she's \"erasing\" their relationship by participating in an event associated with the LGBT community, even though she's in a straight relationship now. He argues that she can't expect straight privileges and LGBT community inclusion simultaneously.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she's still part of the LGBT community because she's bisexual and wants to support the cause. She feels the author is invalidating her sexuality and making her \"be straight\" to make him feel secure. She had a breakdown, which is out of character, indicating the emotional weight of the situation.\n\nFrom a sociological standpoint, bi+ individuals often face erasure from both straight and LGBT communities. The author's stance might stem from insecurity or a lack of understanding of bisexuality. The key point is whether attending Pride as a bi person in a straight relationship invalidates the author's relationship. The community's stance is that bisexuality is a valid part of the LGBT spectrum, and participating in Pride is about solidarity and identity, not current relationship status.\n\nThe author's argument that she can't have both straight and LGBT privileges is problematic. It's similar to how straight allies can support Pride without being part of the community. However, the author's reasoning might be projecting his feelings onto her. The girlfriend's emotional reaction and the author's ultimatum about not accepting her identity could be seen as dismissive of her identity and needs.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention isn't malicious since he's not homophobic. However, his actions are invalidating his partner's identity. The correct approach would be open dialogue, respecting her identity, and understanding that her participation in Pride doesn't diminish their relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting her identity and the importance of community for her.\n"
