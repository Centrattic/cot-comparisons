I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend a gay pride event. The author identifies as not homophobic and supports people being themselves, but he's upset because his girlfriend, who is in a heterosexual relationship with him, still wants to go to pride events. He feels like it's erasing their relationship and that she's pretending to be part of the LGBT community even though she's in a straight relationship now. His girlfriend is bisexual, which he acknowledges, but he argues that she's not \"gay until she's in a gay relationship.\" The girlfriend is upset and left, saying he's erasing her sexuality and that she still feels part of the community.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend identifies as bisexual, which means she's attracted to both genders. Being in a heterosexual relationship doesn't negate her bisexuality. She's not claiming to be exclusively gay, just that she still connects with the LGBT community. Pride events are about celebrating and supporting the community, not just current relationship status. The author's argument that she can't benefit from both straight and LGBT communities is a bit of a false dichotomy. People can be part of multiple communities or have overlapping identities. \n\nThe author's comparison to a female couple going to straight bars is interesting. If a gay woman were in a relationship but still wanted to go to straight bars, would that be considered erasing her relationship? It seems like a different scenario because straight bars aren't about identity and community in the same way pride events are. Pride is specifically about being part of the LGBT community, regardless of current relationship status. The author is conflating participation in community events with one's relationship status, which might not be fair.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that this is a significant issue for her. Feeling like she has to hide part of her identity for her partner's comfort could be seen as invalidating. The author's stance might be making her feel like her bisexuality is only valid if she's in a same-sex relationship, which is not the case. Bisexual people can be in any type of relationship and still identify as part of the LGBT community. \n\nThe author's insecurity about her potential attraction to women is also a factor. He's projecting his own fears onto her, suggesting she's not \"being straight\" and that it's about exploring her sexuality. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is asserting her right to support a cause and community she's part of, which is separate from her current relationship. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it seems like he's not respecting her identity and the importance of the community to her. While he has his feelings, the way he's phrased his arguments (like \"you can't expect the privileges of straight relationship but also the LGBT community\") is a bit reductive. People can belong to multiple communities and their identities don't have to be mutually exclusive. The author's insistence that she must be \"in a gay relationship\" to be considered gay or part of the community is a misunderstanding of bisexuality. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
