I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is in a relationship with his girlfriend who identifies as bisexual. She's been in a five-year relationship with another woman before, but now she's with him. Every year, she attends Gay Pride events with her friends, which include both gay and straight people. The author is upset about this because he feels it erases their current heterosexual relationship and that she's not part of the LGBT community anymore. They had a big argument, and she left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author isn't homophobic, but he's uncomfortable with his girlfriend participating in Pride events when she's in a hetero relationship. He compares it to if she were in a same-sex relationship and went to straight-only events, which he finds similar. The girlfriend argues that bisexuality is valid and that her identity isn't erased by being in a relationship with a man. She also mentions the social challenges she faces from both communities, which the author doesn't fully understand.\n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation where someone is attracted to more than one gender. The author's argument that she's not \"gay\" until she's in a same-sex relationship might be missing the point. Bisexual people can be in hetero relationships but still identify as part of the LGBT community. The author's discomfort seems to stem from feeling that Pride is a space for the LGBT community, which includes bisexual individuals. However, his reaction might be rooted in insecurity or a misunderstanding of his girlfriend's identity.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that attending Pride is important for her to connect with her community and support the cause, regardless of her current relationship status. The author's comparison to a same-sex couple attending straight events isn't quite parallel because bisexuality is inherently part of the LGBT umbrella, whereas a straight person isn't part of that community. The author is asking her to choose between communities, which isn't fair. His statement about her needing to \"be straight\" to fit his insecurities is hurtful and dismissive of her identity.\n\nAlso, the argument led to her having a breakdown, which is a significant emotional response. The author's approach in the conversation might have been confrontational, leading to her feeling erased. Supporting each other's identities and communities is crucial in a relationship. His stance could be seen as invalidating her bisexuality and her need for community support. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, Pride events are about celebrating all parts of the LGBT+ community, including bisexual individuals. The author's view that his girlfriend isn't part of the community because she's in a hetero relationship now is incorrect. Bisexual people often feel caught between both straight and LGBT communities, facing erasure from both. The author's reaction might be an example of biphobia, which is the stigma or discrimination against bisexual individuals.\n\nTherefore, the author's position is problematic because he's not respecting his girlfriend's identity and her right to participate in the community events that are important to her. His argument is based on a misunderstanding of bisexuality and the role of Pride events. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
