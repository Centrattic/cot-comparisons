I appreciate everyone's right to be who they are unapologetically. \n\nWhen I first met my girlfriend, she's just got out of a 5 year relationship with a female. \nShe identified as Gay but when she met me, in her words \"I've always been open minded and if I fancy a girl, I fancy a girl, if I fancy a guy, I fancy a guy - it just so happens I've never fancied a guy before you\".\n\nWe've been together 3 years now and love together. Generally were really happy and I feel blessed to be with such an easy-going and kind hearted girl. \n\nEvery year, she goes to gay pride with her friends, most of which are gay and a few are straight. This year, she wants to go again. The thing is, I have an issue with this because she is in a hetero relationship, she is not dating women and when she goes to pride, I see it as erasing our relationship and acting as if she is still gay. \n\nShe had a break down when I mentioned it which is completely out of character. She said that when she was with a girl, she was outcasted by the straight community and now she's in a hetero relationship, she's not fully accepted in the LGBT community. She says it's one time a year where she can express her pride in being part of a community that has been through so much. But I can't understand her need to be there when at present, she is not a part of the community. She's very passionate about the cause and says that she will always support pride and still feels a part of LGBT community. She says she isn't straight just cause she's with a guy, that she is still bi and therefore wants to continue to support other people, who are in LGBT community.\n\nI told her I didn't like her going to pride as if she's gay, being around gay females who will assume she's gay when she comes home to straight relationship. I told her you can't expect the privileges of a straight relationship but also the LGBT community at the same time. She did not take this well. \n\nShe told me that she couldn't see a future with me if I'm forever going to \"erase her sexuality\" and make her \"be straight\" to protect my insecurities. She also says that she is still attracted to females and therefore is still Bi but in my opinion, she isn't gay until she's in a gay relationship. Maybe, I'm wrong but imagine being in a female+female relationship but your girlfriend going to straight bars and straight pride events. It's the same thing. I feel as if she's saying our relationship isn't enough, that she still wants to explore the other side of her sexuality despite her saying she would never look elsewhere whilst with me. \n\nShe's stormed out and hasn't been home since an hour ago. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling like this? \nI support gay pride but find it hurtful that my girlfriend wants to access such communities. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his girlfriend to attend Gay Pride. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as not homophobic and respects everyone's rights. His girlfriend is bisexual, previously in a same-sex relationship, now in a heterosexual one. She wants to attend Pride again this year, which the author objects to. His main issue is that she's in a hetero relationship and not part of the LGBT community anymore, so she shouldn't go to Pride. He feels it's erasing their relationship and that she's not fully committed to being straight. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels her bisexuality is erased if she stops participating in Pride. She's part of the LGBT community, and attending is about supporting the cause and her identity. She gets upset, says he's erasing her sexuality, and storm out.\n\nSo, the key points here are about identity, acceptance, and boundaries. The author's stance seems to be based on the idea that once you're in a hetero relationship, you're not part of the LGBT community anymore. But bisexuality isn't exclusive. A bi person can be in a hetero relationship and still identify as part of the LGBT community. The author is invalidating her identity by suggesting that her participation in Pride negates their relationship. That's a problem because it's about her personal identity and her right to express her sexuality regardless of current relationship status.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that her bisexuality is a core part of her identity. Even though she's in a relationship with a man, she still feels connected to the LGBT community and supports their causes. Her attending Pride isn't about being attracted to women right now but about her broader identity. The author's argument that she's not part of the community now is incorrect because bisexuality is a valid sexual identity irrespective of current relationship status. \n\nAdditionally, the author's comparison to a female in a same-sex relationship attending straight bars might not hold because the context is different. Pride is specifically for the LGBT community, not just a social event. Straight bars don't serve the same purpose as Pride events. So the analogy might be flawed.\n\nThe author's behavior could be seen as controlling or invalidating his girlfriend's identity. By not supporting her participation in an event that's important to her identity, he's causing distress. The fact that she had a breakdown suggests that his words hurt her deeply. It's possible that the author is projecting his insecurities onto her, as he mentions being concerned about her being around gay women, which might stem from jealousy or lack of trust.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's refusal to accept his girlfriend's bisexuality and her right to engage with the LGBT community even in a hetero relationship is problematic. The girlfriend is asserting her identity, which is something the author should support. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting her identity and is making her feel like she has to choose between her relationship and her sexuality.\n"
