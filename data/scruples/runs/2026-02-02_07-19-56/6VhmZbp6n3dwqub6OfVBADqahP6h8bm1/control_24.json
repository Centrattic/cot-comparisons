Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were sent to a residential hospital, and they explicitly told their mom not to tell people except close family. But then the mom posted about it on Facebook, which the author found out about when they were scrolling through their mom's page. The posts were something like \"We had to check our daughter into Veritas for treatment\" and asking for prayers, which the author found offensive because they're not religious. The author then deleted the posts since they knew their mom's password.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had made a clear request to their mom not to share this information publicly, and the mom didn't follow through. The author felt violated because their privacy was compromised, especially given their mental health issues. They were worried about strangers judging or pitying them, which they can't stand. Then they took action by deleting the posts without their mom's knowledge.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the mom broke a promise by sharing the information. The author's actions were in response to that breach. However, deleting someone else's posts without their permission is a privacy and trust issue. The author used the mom's password, which is another ethical point\u2014they shouldn't have shared that password. But the mom might have given the password out before, or maybe the author had access because they set up the account. Either way, the author's action of deleting the posts without consent is questionable.\n\nBut then again, the author's motivation was to protect their privacy, which they had explicitly requested. The mom didn't respect that, so the author felt they had to take matters into their own hands. It's a bit of a conflict between respecting boundaries and the method used to enforce them. On one hand, the author's actions were to protect their mental health and privacy. On the other hand, they violated their mom's digital space without consent.\n\nSo, is it right or wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the mom broke a promise, maybe the author's intention is understandable. However, the action of deleting without consent is still a breach. But considering the context of mental health and privacy concerns, some might side with the author. Others might say that regardless of the reason, the method was wrong. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since they had a valid reason and the mom didn't follow through on her agreement, maybe the answer leans towards not being in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a standard for such situations. Usually, violating someone's account is not okay, but the context here is a privacy violation by the mom. It's a tough call. The author's actions were to protect their own privacy, so maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer here.\n"
