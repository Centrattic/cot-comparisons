Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their mom's Facebook posts is in the wrong. The situation involves the person being in recovery for mental illnesses like anorexia and had explicitly told their mom not to share their treatment publicly. The mom, however, posted about it on Facebook, which the person found upsetting because they didn't want people to pity them or define them by their illness.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the breach of trust. The person with the mental illness clearly communicated their wishes to the mother, who then violated that trust by making public posts. The mother's actions could have led to the person feeling humiliated or stigmatized, which is a serious issue. \n\nNext, the action of deleting the posts. The person used their mom's login, which they knew because the mom reused passwords. While hacking into someone's account is generally wrong, the context here is a violation of a prior agreement. The person's intent was to protect their privacy, not to harm their mom, but the means involved unauthorized access.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is balancing the right to privacy and confidentiality against the act of hacking. Even though the mother made a mistake, the son's method of correcting it was not appropriate. There might have been better ways to address the issue, like talking to the mom first or confronting her about the breach, rather than deleting the posts without her knowledge. \n\nHowever, the mother's actions were the initial problem. She didn't respect her child's wishes, which is a significant issue. The son's motivation was to protect his privacy, which is valid given his mental health struggles. Yet, the act of deleting without permission could be seen as a violation of the mother's autonomy, even if it was to correct a prior wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the ends justify the means. The son did the right thing in protecting his privacy, but the method was unethical. But considering the mother's initial breach of trust, some might argue that the son's actions were understandable, albeit not the correct approach. The answer hinges on whether the violation of the mother's account overshadows the initial wrong done by the mother.\n"
