Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author's mental health and their mom sharing details about their treatment without permission.\n\nFirst, the author had explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with people outside close family. The mom didn't follow that, which is a breach of trust. The author then deletes the posts because they don't want their illness to define them and dislike pity. \n\nNow, considering privacy and consent. The mom shared personal health information without permission, which is a privacy violation. The author's action was to protect their own privacy, even though it was done without the mom's consent. The question is whether the author's method (deleting the posts) makes them wrong.\n\nOn one hand, deleting someone else's posts without asking is a privacy issue. The mom's account and her posts, so the author didn't own the content. But on the other hand, the mom broke a promise, and the author felt vulnerable. The author's intent was to protect their own well-being. \n\nLegally, it's about consent. The mom's action was a breach, but the author's deletion was unauthorized. However, morally, the author's action can be seen as self-preservation. The community might weigh the breach of trust against the violation of the mom's account. \n\nConsidering the context of mental health recovery and the mom's social butterfly nature, the author's concern about public exposure is valid. The key points are: explicit agreement from the mom not to share, the mom's violation, and the author's action to prevent further harm. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mom is definitely wrong for breaking the agreement. The author's action is more nuanced. While it's a privacy violation, it's in response to a prior violation. The author's intent was protective, so the judgment might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, especially given the mental health context.\n"
