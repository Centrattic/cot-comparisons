Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their hospitalization for an eating disorder. The author had explicitly told their mom not to share that information, and then the mom did so anyway, leading the author to delete the posts themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable state, in recovery from serious mental illnesses. They had made a clear request to their mother not to share their condition with a broader audience. The mother, however, went ahead and posted about it on Facebook, which the author found problematic. The key points here are consent and breach of trust. The mother agreed not to share, but did so anyway, which is a clear violation of that agreement.\n\nThe author then took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts, which raises ethical questions. While the mother's actions were wrong, the author's response of deleting the posts without her knowledge could be seen as a form of retaliation or invasion of privacy. However, the author's motivation was to protect their privacy and mental health, which is understandable given the sensitive nature of the information and the context of their recovery.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother broke the agreement, so the author could argue that they were trying to correct a breach of trust. On the other hand, deleting someone else's posts without their consent could be considered an invasion of privacy, even if the intent was good. However, the mother's actions were the initial transgression. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's intent was to protect their privacy, which the mother had already promised not to compromise. The author's action might be seen as a way to rectify a mistake made by the mother. However, the method\u2014deleting the posts without informing the mother\u2014could be problematic because it's a secretive action. But given the context of mental health and the violation of trust, some might view the author's action as a justified measure to protect their own well-being.\n\nI need to weigh the harm of the mother's breach of trust against the author's breach of the mother's privacy. The mother's actions could have caused lasting harm to the author's social standing and mental health, while the author's actions were a temporary concealment. The author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their own interests as per the initial agreement. But others might argue that the right way to handle it would be to confront the mother and ask her to delete the posts, rather than doing it oneself.\n\nHowever, considering the situation, the author was in a vulnerable state and perhaps felt that immediate action was necessary to prevent further harm. The mother's actions were the primary issue, so the author's response, while possibly not the most ideal, was a reaction to a breach of trust. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
