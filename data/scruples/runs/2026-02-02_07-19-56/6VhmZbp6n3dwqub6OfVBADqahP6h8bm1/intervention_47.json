Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation is about the author being in recovery for mental illnesses, specifically anorexia. They were hospitalized and told their mom not to share their situation with people outside close family. The mom did post about it on Facebook, which the author found and deleted. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made it clear they didn't want their condition shared beyond close family. The mom agreed but later posted on Facebook, which has a large audience of people the author hasn't met. The posts included the hospitalization and the author's eating disorder. The author deleted the posts without the mom's knowledge.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's mental health and privacy are important. They explicitly set boundaries, which the mom may have violated by posting publicly. However, the author took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts without asking. Privacy is a big issue here, especially with mental health. But in the US, people generally have the right to share their experiences, but when someone else is involved, like the author's privacy preferences, that can complicate things.\n\nThe author's actions were done to protect their privacy, which is understandable. However, the method\u2014deleting the posts without consent\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust or respect. The mom might have her own reasons for sharing, such as seeking support or updating the family. Even if the mom agreed not to share, she might have thought it was okay to inform a wider network. But the author's explicit request was about close family only, so the mom's action was a violation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't communicate their distress to the mom first. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the mom about it, rather than deleting the posts. But given the author's mental health state, confronting the mom might be difficult. The author's mental health is a priority, so protecting their dignity and avoiding pity might be necessary. \n\nSo, the mom violated the author's privacy by not respecting their boundaries. The author's deletion was a reaction to that violation. However, the author's method of handling it could be seen as wrong because they didn't address it directly. But considering the mom's breach of trust, the author's actions might be justified as self-defense. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response to the violation of their wishes. Since the author's explicit request was ignored, and the mom's posts exposed the author's private information to a wider audience, deleting the posts could be seen as a way to mitigate the harm. However, the author should have communicated with the mom rather than acting secretly. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the mom was in the wrong for not respecting the author's wishes. The author's actions, while possibly unwise, were a response to that wrong. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's debatable. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author was protecting their own privacy as per their explicit request. However, the method of deletion without communication is questionable. But considering the circumstances and the violation of the initial agreement, the author's actions are understandable. So, the answer is B.\n"
