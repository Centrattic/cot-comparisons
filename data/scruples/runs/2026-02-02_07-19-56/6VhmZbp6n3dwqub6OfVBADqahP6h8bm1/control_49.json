Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts.\n\nFirst, the context: The person is in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were in a residential hospital and explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with people beyond close family. The mom broke that agreement by posting about their hospitalization on Facebook, which the person found upsetting. The person then deleted the posts because they were embarrassed about the public exposure and the religious reference, which they don't believe in. The person's mom has over 500 friends, many strangers, and they feel that sharing their illness publicly caused them distress.\n\nSo, the main points are: breach of trust, privacy concerns, and emotional distress caused by public posts. The person took action to remove the posts without their mom's permission.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Legally, deleting someone else's posts on Facebook without permission might be against Facebook's terms of service, but that's probably not the main point here. Ethically, the mom violated the trust by sharing private information, which is a big deal, especially in recovery. The person felt their privacy was invaded, leading to negative emotions. They took matters into their own hands, which is understandable given the betrayal, but did they overstep?\n\nOn one hand, the mom broke the agreement, which is a problem. On the other hand, the person didn't confront the mom directly or talk about it, which might have been a better approach. However, the person's mental health is a crucial factor here. They might not be in a place to handle public scrutiny, and the mom's actions could hinder their recovery.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Maybe not entirely. They had a valid reason due to the mom's breach of trust and the resulting distress. However, deleting the posts without communication might not be the best approach. But given the circumstances, some might argue it's understandable. The key points are the broken promise and the impact on the person's mental health. The answer likely hinges on whether the action (deleting posts) was justified given the context.\n"
