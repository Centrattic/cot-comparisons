Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were sent to a residential hospital and told their mom not to tell anyone except close family and friends. The mom ended up posting on Facebook about checking the author into the hospital and asking for prayers. The author, who isn't religious, found these posts while searching for a family photo. They deleted the posts because they didn't want strangers to know about their condition and feel pity. The mom has a lot of Facebook friends, many the author doesn't know. The author used their mom's password to delete the posts, and the mom hasn't noticed.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the author's privacy concerns, the mom's breach of the agreed-upon confidentiality, and the method the author used to address it. The author had explicitly told their mom not to share their condition beyond close family, but the mom did so anyway. The author felt that the posts were public, included strangers, and made them feel defined by their illness and pitied, which is something they can't stand. The author then took action by deleting the posts without the mom's knowledge, using her password.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mom did break the trust by sharing the information publicly without permission, which could be a violation of the author's boundaries. The author had mental health reasons for keeping this private, and the mom's posts might have caused the author distress. The author's deletion of the posts could be seen as an attempt to protect their privacy and mental well-being, even if the method was unauthorized.\n\nOn the other hand, the author used their mom's password to delete the posts without her consent. That's a privacy violation in itself. Even if the reason is good, accessing someone else's account is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust and privacy. The author could have addressed the issue by talking to their mom about it instead of taking matters into their own hands. Deleting the posts might have been a necessary step to protect their mental health, but the method used could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the mom's intention might have been to support her daughter by seeking prayers, but the author found it unhelpful and offensive. The mom might have thought she was being supportive, but she didn't consider the daughter's feelings about the public nature of the posts and the religious aspect. The author's actions were a direct response to the violation, but the method was unethical. However, given the author's mental health situation and the urgency to remove the posts, maybe their actions were more about self-preservation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the ends justify the means. The author had a valid reason for wanting the posts removed, but the method of deletion without permission is an ethical issue. In many cases, hacking into someone's account, even with the same password they use for everything, is a violation of privacy. The author could have approached the mom, maybe confronted her about the breach of trust, and asked her to take the posts down. If the mom refused, the author might have other options, but deleting the posts without consent crosses a line.\n\nTherefore, while the author's intentions were to protect their privacy and mental health, the action of deleting the posts without permission is ethically wrong. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
