Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The context is that the author has mental illnesses and was in a residential hospital for an eating disorder. They told their mom not to share their condition with people outside close family, but the mom posted about it on Facebook with a lot of friends. The author then deleted the posts because they didn't want strangers to know and feel pity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries here. The author explicitly told their mom not to share their condition beyond close family. The mom didn't follow that request, which is a breach of trust. The author's main concern is about privacy and how others might perceive them, especially since they're in recovery. The mom's posts could lead to unwanted attention and stigma. \n\nBut then, the author deleted the posts without the mom's consent. While the mom broke the agreement by posting, the author took a secret action. Is that acceptable? The author's action was to protect their privacy, which is valid. However, the method involved hacking into the mom's account, which is a violation of the mom's privacy. \n\nOn one hand, the mom violated the author's privacy by sharing sensitive information. On the other, the author violated the mom's privacy by deleting her posts without permission. There's a conflict here between respecting the author's wishes and respecting the mom's autonomy.\n\nThe key points are: \n1. The author had a clear privacy concern and communicated it.\n2. The mom didn't respect that boundary.\n3. The author took action to protect their privacy but in a way that invaded the mom's privacy.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action is justified. Some might argue that the mom's breach was more significant, so the author's response was necessary. Others might say that using deception (using the mom's password) to delete the posts is also wrong, regardless of intent. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, hacking into someone's account is a violation, so technically the author is in the wrong in that action. However, the context of mental health and privacy adds complexity. The mom's actions were the initial problem, but the author's solution isn't without fault. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the action of deleting the posts is considered a justifiable privacy protection or an overreach. But since the method involved unauthorized access, it's likely the author is in the wrong, hence answer A.\n"
