Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post) is at fault for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in recovery from multiple mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were sent to a residential hospital and explicitly told their mom not to tell anyone except close family friends and relatives. The mom, however, posted about the situation on Facebook, which the author found out while searching for a family photo. The posts mentioned the hospital and were asking for prayers, which the author isn't religious. They also mention that their mom has over 500 Facebook friends, many of whom they don't know. The author deleted the posts because they didn't want strangers to define them by their illness and feel pity. They used their mom's password to do this.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The author had agreed with the mom that only close family and friends would be informed. The mom broke that agreement by posting publicly. The author's reaction is understandable given their mental health and the potential violation of their privacy. However, the act of deleting someone else's posts without their knowledge is a breach of privacy. Even if the mom overstepped, the author took matters into their own hands without discussing it first. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of mental health and the urgency the author felt. The posts could have caused lasting emotional distress and embarrassment. The author might not have felt they could confront their mom about it, especially if they were in recovery and dealing with a lot already. Using the mom's password might be a privacy issue, but if the mom reused passwords, maybe there's some fault there too. \n\nSo, on one hand, the author did something that could be seen as unethical (deleting posts without consent), but on the other hand, they were protecting their privacy and mental well-being. The question is whether the means justified the ends. In many cases, people might understand the author's actions, especially given the circumstances. However, ethically, acting without consent is usually frowned upon. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the mom violated the agreed-upon privacy, and the author's intent was to protect themselves. But I need to check if there's a standard here. In AITA scenarios, actions that breach someone's privacy, even for good reasons, can lead to the person being considered an asshole. But the context here is significant. The mom's actions were the initial problem, and the author's response, while invasive, was a reaction to that. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the mom broke the agreement, and the author's actions were self-protective. However, some might argue that the author should have talked to their mom first. But given the author's mental health struggles, maybe direct confrontation wasn't feasible. So, B makes sense here.\n"
