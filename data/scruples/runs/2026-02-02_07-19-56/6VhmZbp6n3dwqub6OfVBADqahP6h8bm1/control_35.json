Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves mental health issues and privacy.\n\nFirst, the author is in recovery from anorexia and was explicit about not wanting their mom to share their treatment publicly. The mom, however, did post about it on Facebook, which the author found problematic for two reasons: religious content (prayers) and the pity from strangers. The author then deleted the posts because they knew their mom's password.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and privacy. The author had told their mom not to share the information, but she did anyway. The author took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts. Legally, deleting someone else's posts without permission is a privacy violation. But ethically, there's a conflict: the mom broke the agreement, but the author violated her privacy by deleting the posts.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions were to protect their privacy and mental health, which is understandable. On the other hand, they didn't confront their mom directly, which might have been a better approach. The author's mental health is a significant factor here. However, the act of deleting the posts without discussion could be seen as wrong because it's an invasion of the mother's space. But considering the breach of trust from the mom's side, maybe the author had some justification. \n\nBut ultimately, the author shouldn't have deleted the posts without talking to their mom. Even if the mom was at fault, the right approach would be communication, not unilateral action. So, the author is in the wrong because they violated their mother's privacy, even if their intentions were good. The answer is A.\n"
