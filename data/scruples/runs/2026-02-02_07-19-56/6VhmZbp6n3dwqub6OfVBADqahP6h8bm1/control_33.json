Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. \n\nFirst, the context: the author is in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were very clear with their mom that they didn't want the mom to tell people except close family. The mom, however, posted about the hospitalization on Facebook with a lot of friends, which the author found out when they saw these posts. The author then deleted the posts because they didn't want strangers to know and felt pity was bad.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and privacy. The author had explicitly told their mom not to share this information. The mom didn't respect that, which led to the author taking action. \n\nNow, the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, deleting someone else's posts without permission might seem like a violation of privacy or trust. But on the other hand, the mom broke the agreement by posting the information against the author's wishes, which caused distress. The author acted to protect their privacy, which is a personal right. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The mom might feel hurt that her child deleted her posts, but the author's action was to correct a breach of trust. Also, the author's mental health is a factor here. They are in recovery and the situation added stress. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author didn't have the right to delete the posts, but the mom didn't have the right to post them. However, the author's action was a response to a violation of their consent. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the author's intent was to protect their privacy and mental well-being, which they had a right to, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
