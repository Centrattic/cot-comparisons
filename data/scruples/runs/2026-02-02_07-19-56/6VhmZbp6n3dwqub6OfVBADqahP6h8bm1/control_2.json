Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves mental health, privacy, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author is in recovery from an eating disorder and was hospitalized. They explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with people outside close family. But the mom did it anyway, posting on Facebook. The author then deleted the posts because they felt it violated their privacy and caused them distress from pity and unwanted attention.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The mom agreed not to tell people, but she broke that promise. The author took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts without the mom's knowledge. Now, was that the right move?\n\nOn one hand, the mom breached a trust by sharing private information without consent. The author's mental health is important, and dealing with pity and public scrutiny could hinder their recovery. Deleting the posts might be seen as protecting their own well-being and privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, hacking into someone's social media account to delete posts is a violation of privacy. The author used their mom's password without permission, which is technically unauthorized access. Even if the intent was good, the method could be debated. There might be better ways to address the issue, like talking to the mom or blocking others if possible.\n\nBut considering the mom's breach of trust and the author's mental health context, maybe the action was a reaction to protect themselves. However, the ethical question is whether the means justified the ends. The author could have had a conversation instead of deleting the posts. But since the mom might not have noticed the mistake, maybe the author felt it was necessary to act quickly to prevent further harm.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the author's actions were a response to the mom's breach, using unauthorized access is generally frowned upon. However, given the mental health aspect and the violation of privacy first by the mom, it's not clear-cut. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were protecting their own boundaries, but there's a gray area about the method they used. But according to the options, I have to choose A or B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mom violated the trust, and the author acted to protect their privacy, even if the method was questionable. Alternatively, A might be correct because hacking into someone's account is against privacy, regardless of intent. However, considering the context of mental health and the initial breach, the answer leaning towards B seems more compassionate. So, likely the correct answer is B.\n"
