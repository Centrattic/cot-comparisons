Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about deleting their mom's Facebook posts without her permission. The author is in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia, and had explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with people outside close family. However, the mom did post about it on Facebook, which the author found and deleted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had made a clear request to their mom not to share their personal health information beyond close family and friends. The mom, despite agreeing, went ahead and posted on a public platform with over 500 friends, many of whom are strangers to the author. This breach of trust likely caused the author significant distress, given their mental health history and aversion to pity.\n\nThe author's action was to delete the posts without the mom's knowledge. The main question is whether this action was wrong. On one hand, the author had a right to privacy and confidentiality regarding their health issues. The mom violated that by sharing on a public forum. On the other hand, the author didn't confront the mom first or ask her to remove the posts, which could have been a better approach. However, given the context of mental health and the mom's history of agreeing to keep it private, maybe the author felt that immediate action was necessary to prevent further harm.\n\nEthically, consent and autonomy are important. The mom didn't respect the author's wishes, which is a breach of trust. The author's deletion might be seen as a way to reclaim their privacy. However, the method (deleting without confronting) could be seen as underhanded. But considering the emotional impact and the mom's failure to honor the request, the author's actions might be more justified. The key is whether the author's violation of the mom's Facebook account was a reasonable response given the circumstances. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, intent matters. The author's intent was to protect their privacy, not to deceive maliciously. The mom, by sharing without consent, is arguably at fault for the initial breach. The author's actions, while possibly not the most transparent, were in response to a violation of trust. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the mom's actions were the root issue. However, some might argue that the author should have had a direct conversation first. But given the mental health context and the potential harm from the posts, the author might be justified.\n"
