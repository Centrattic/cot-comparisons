Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author being in recovery from mental illnesses and anorexia. They explicitly told their mom not to share their condition publicly, but the mom did anyway. The author then deleted the posts because they felt violated and upset by the pity and public exposure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had clearly communicated their wishes, so the mom's actions were a breach of trust. The mom posted about the hospitalization, which included the author's personal health information. The author then took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts without the mom's knowledge. \n\nLegally, there might be privacy concerns here. The author might have a right to privacy, especially regarding sensitive health information. However, the method of deleting the posts\u2014using the mom's password\u2014could be an issue. Unauthorized access to someone's account is generally considered a breach of privacy as well. So even though the intent was to protect their privacy, the means might be questionable.\n\nEthically, the mom violated the author's trust by sharing private information. The author's reaction is understandable given their mental health and the stress of recovery. However, hacking into someone's account to delete posts is not a typical or legal solution. The author might have other options, like confronting the mom directly or using Facebook's reporting features to remove the posts, rather than taking control of the account themselves.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the mom's actions being the initial wrong. If the mom broke the trust, maybe the author's actions are a reaction to that breach. However, the author still has a responsibility to handle the situation in a way that's within legal and ethical boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might hinge on whether the method of deletion justifies the action. Since the mom was wrong first, but the author's response was unauthorized access, which could be a separate issue. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting privacy, but the method of deletion could make them responsible for another transgression. However, considering the context of mental health and the mom's prior violation, some might argue that the author's actions are justified. \n\nBut legally and ethically, using someone's password without permission is a problem. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for the method, even if their intent was good. The correct approach would have been to address the mom directly or use proper channels to remove the posts. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the unauthorized access, despite the initial breach by the mom.\n"
