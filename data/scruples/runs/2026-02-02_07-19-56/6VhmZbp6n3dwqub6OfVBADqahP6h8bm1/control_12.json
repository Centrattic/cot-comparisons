Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. \n\nFirst, the background: The author is in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia. They went to a residential hospital and explicitly told their mom not to share their situation publicly except with close family. The mom, however, posted about their hospitalization on Facebook, which has over 500 friends. The author deleted those posts because they felt the mom violated their privacy and the posts made them uncomfortable, especially mentioning religion which they don't practice. The mom hasn't noticed the deletion yet.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and privacy. The author had clearly communicated their wishes to the mom, who didn't follow through. The author then took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, deleting someone else's Facebook posts without permission is a privacy issue. But on the other hand, the mom might have overstepped by posting private information publicly against the author's wishes. The author's motivation was protecting their privacy, which is a valid concern, especially given their mental health issues.\n\nBut the act of deleting the posts without the mom's knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. Even though the mom didn't follow the original agreement, the author's response was to remove the posts themselves. That might not be justified, even if the mom was at fault. The author could have approached the mom to discuss the issue instead of taking action without her knowledge.\n\nHowever, considering the context\u2014mental health, privacy concerns, and the mom's failure to respect the author's wishes\u2014it's possible that the author felt they had no other choice. The mom's actions could have caused the author significant distress, and deleting the posts was a way to prevent further harm. \n\nBut in terms of right vs. wrong, the act of deleting someone else's posts without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if the mom was in the wrong for posting, the author's response was to delete the content, which is interfering with someone else's account. \n\nSo, while the author had valid reasons for being upset, the method they used to address the issue might make them the one at fault. The right approach would have been to confront the mom about the breach of privacy and ask her to remove the posts themselves. Deleting them without permission is a violation of the mom's account and possibly against Facebook's terms of service. \n\nTherefore, even though the author's intentions were good, their actions might be considered wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
