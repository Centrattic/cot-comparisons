Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing by deleting their mom's Facebook posts. So, the user is in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were sent to a residential hospital and explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with anyone except close family friends and relatives. The mom agreed. But later, the mom posted on Facebook about checking the daughter into a treatment center, which the author found offensive and embarrassing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries the author set. They clearly communicated their wishes to their mom, and the mom agreed. However, the mom didn't follow through and instead shared the information publicly. The author then deleted the posts without the mom's knowledge. \n\nIs this okay? Well, the author's right to privacy is a big factor here. Mental health is a sensitive topic, and sharing it without consent can be really harmful, especially in a public space like Facebook where the audience is large and includes people the author doesn't even know. The author's frustration is understandable, especially given their history with pity and the stigma around mental illness.\n\nBut then, the author didn't talk to their mom first. Instead of discussing the issue with her, they took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts. That's a breach of the mom's privacy and trust. Maybe they should have had a conversation first. However, the mom had already agreed not to share the information, so there's a betrayal there. The author might feel that their boundaries were violated, and the mom's actions were a direct breach of that agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's method of deleting the posts without telling their mom could be seen as underhanded. While the mom's actions were wrong, the author's response might not be the best approach. There's a difference between the wrong done and the way one responds to it. The author could face consequences if the mom finds out, which could affect their relationship.\n\nBut considering the emotional impact on the author, their mental health is at stake. Public shaming or pity could set back their recovery. The mom's actions might have been well-intentioned (seeking support or prayers), but without the daughter's consent, it's a violation. \n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The author's privacy was violated by the mom's posts. 2) The author had explicitly forbidden this. 3) The author's response was to delete the posts without discussing it first. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were respecting their own boundaries, but their method was intrusive. However, given the context of mental health and the breach of trust, maybe the action was justified. But since they didn't communicate with their mom first, maybe that's where the line is crossed. The answer might depend on whether the ends justify the means. If the mom is a social butterfly, maybe she would have posted again if the author didn't act. But the author could have talked to her first. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their primary right to privacy was violated, and they took steps to protect their mental health. However, the method was not ideal. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they were defending their explicit wishes, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that deleting someone else's posts without permission is wrong regardless. It's a bit of a moral dilemma. But given the context of the author's mental health and the mom's breach of the agreement, the author's action is more about self-preservation. So I'm leaning towards B.\n"
