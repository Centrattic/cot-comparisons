Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation is about the author's mental health recovery and their mom sharing details about their treatment without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was in a residential hospital for an eating disorder and explicitly told their mom not to tell anyone except close family. The mom broke that agreement and posted on Facebook, which the author found and deleted. The author is in recovery and doesn't want people pitying them, especially since they're not religious. They also mention that their mom has many Facebook friends, which adds to the problem.\n\nThe main issue here is consent. The mom agreed not to share, but she did. The author felt violated and took action by deleting the posts. Now, the question is if the author was wrong to do that. \n\nOn one hand, hacking into someone's account is definitely unethical and illegal. The author used their mom's password without permission, which is a breach of privacy. That's a clear problem. However, the context is important. The author was vulnerable, in recovery, and the mom broke a promise. The author's actions were to protect their privacy and mental health.\n\nBut the act of deleting the posts without consent is still wrong, regardless of the motive. Even if the mom was in the wrong, the author's method of addressing it was inappropriate. The author should have communicated with their mom instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, balancing the two sides: the mom's breach of privacy is bad, but the author's hacking and deletion is also wrong. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author used their mom's password without consent, that's a violation of privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method they used to correct the mom's mistake was unethical and illegal, even if the intent was to protect their privacy.\n"
