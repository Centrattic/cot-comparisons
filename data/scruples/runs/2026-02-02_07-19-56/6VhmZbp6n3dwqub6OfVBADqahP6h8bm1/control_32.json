Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author having mental health issues, specifically anorexia, and being in a residential hospital. They told their mom not to share their condition publicly, which the mom did anyway. The author then deleted those posts without the mom's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's mom agreed not to tell anyone except close family, but she broke that promise. The author felt violated because their private information was shared without consent, leading to potential pity and defining them by their illness. The mom's posts were on a public platform with many friends, which could spread the information further than intended.\n\nThe author's action was to delete the posts because they knew the password. Now, the question is whether this action was wrong. Legally, deleting someone else's posts might be an issue, but the context is about moral responsibility. The author had a valid reason\u2014they trusted their mom not to share, and the mom didn't keep that trust. The author's mental health is a significant factor here; being defined by their illness and feeling pitied is harmful for someone in recovery. \n\nHowever, the act of deleting without permission could be seen as a breach of trust or an invasion of privacy. But given the circumstances, the author might have felt it was necessary to protect their privacy and mental well-being. The mom's actions were the initial breach, so the author's response, while not ideal, was a way to mitigate the damage. It's a tough situation where both parties might have valid points, but the mom's violation of the agreement is the primary issue. The author's action was a reaction to that violation, aiming to reclaim their privacy. So, considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
