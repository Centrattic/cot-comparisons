Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in recovery from an eating disorder and was in a residential hospital. They specifically told their mom not to share their condition with people outside close family. The mom did post about it on Facebook, which the author found offensive because it included religious elements and exposed their personal health information to strangers. The author then deleted the posts without telling their mom.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author had explicitely asked their mom not to share this information. The mom didn't follow through, possibly out of concern but violating the author's privacy. The author's actions were to protect their own privacy and mental health. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, deleting someone else's Facebook posts without permission is a privacy issue. Even if the mom broke the trust, the author took matters into their own hands. However, the mom's actions were the initial breach. The author's mental health is a significant factor here. They might have felt violated and acted to protect themselves. \n\nLegally, you can't delete someone's posts without their consent, but emotionally, the author's actions stem from a place of protecting their own well-being. The mom's posts could have caused the author distress. So while the action itself is a privacy violation, the context might justify it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. The author had good intentions but violated their mom's Facebook account. However, the mom's initial action was the problem. The author's mental health is crucial here, and they might have felt they had no other choice. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author's actions were to protect their privacy and mental health, given their explicit request was ignored. But there's a line between privacy and autonomy. The author didn't confront the mom first, but given their mental state, maybe that's understandable. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong considering the circumstances. The main issue is the mom not respecting the author's wishes, leading to the author taking action to protect themselves.\n"
