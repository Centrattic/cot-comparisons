Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their hospitalization for an eating disorder. The user is in recovery and had explicitly told their mom not to share that information. The mom did anyway, which the user found out through Facebook. The user then deleted the posts using their mom's password, which they had access to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They entrusted their mom with confidentiality, which the mom breached. The posts were public, potentially exposing the user to pity and stigma, which the user strongly dislikes. The user's action was to delete the posts to protect their privacy. However, the method involved accessing their mom's account without her consent, which is a privacy invasion.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom did agree not to share the information, so she violated that trust. The user might feel it was necessary to act to protect their mental health. But deleting the posts without telling the mom could lead to future issues if the mom doesn't realize her mistake. The user might have handled it better by confronting the mom first.\n\nLegally, deleting someone else's posts without permission might not be a crime, but ethically, it's questionable. The user's mental health is a significant factor here. They were in a vulnerable state, and the breach of trust could have triggered their condition again. However, the act of hacking into the mom's account, even if it's the same password, is still a privacy violation. \n\nThe key points are: breach of trust by the mom, the user's right to privacy, and the method used to rectify the situation. The user's intent was to protect themselves, but the means were problematic. The mom's actions were wrong, but the user's response also had ethical issues. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the user might not be entirely at fault because the mom broke the agreement first. However, the user could have approached the situation differently. The question is whether deleting the posts without consent makes the user wrong. Considering all factors, it's a nuanced situation where both parties made mistakes, but the user's action was a reaction to the mom's breach. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the user's main goal was self-preservation and protecting their mental health. The mom's breach was the primary issue, and the user acted to prevent further harm. While the method was questionable, the intent was to protect their privacy, which the mom had agreed to respect initially.\n"
