Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. \n\nFirst, the author is in recovery from anorexia and other mental illnesses. They were very clear with their mom that they didn't want people outside close family to know about their hospitalization. The mom, however, posted about it on Facebook, which has over 500 friends, many of whom the author doesn't know. The author then deleted the posts because they didn't like the idea of strangers judging or pitying them based on their illness.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The author had explicitly told their mom not to share this information beyond close family. The mom broke that trust by posting publicly. The author deleted the posts to protect their privacy, which is understandable given their mental health struggles and aversion to pity.\n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? Well, hacking into someone's account, even if they use the same password for everything, is a privacy violation. However, the context is important. The mother's actions were a breach of the agreed-upon confidentiality. The author acted out of a place of protecting their own mental health. \n\nSome might argue that the author shouldn't have accessed their mom's account, regardless of the reason. Others might see it as a justified act to prevent further harm from the mother's breach of trust. The mother's actions were the initial problem here. The author's response, while potentially ethically murky, was driven by a need to protect their own well-being. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to uphold the confidentiality they had agreed upon. The mother's behavior was the primary issue. So the answer is probably B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
