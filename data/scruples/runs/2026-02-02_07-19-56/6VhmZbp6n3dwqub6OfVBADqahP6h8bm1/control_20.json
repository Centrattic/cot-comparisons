Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their hospitalization for an eating disorder. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The author has mental illnesses and explicitly told their mom not to share this information except with close family. The mom, however, posted on Facebook, which the author found problematic for several reasons: the posts were religious (which the author isn't into), and the mom has a large number of friends, many of whom the author doesn't know. The author felt that these posts would lead to people judging or pitying them, which they can't stand. So they deleted the posts without telling their mom.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had given specific instructions about their privacy. The mom didn't respect that, which caused the author distress. The author's mental health is a significant factor here. They might feel that the mom's actions violated their trust and boundaries. Deleting the posts could be seen as a way to protect their own well-being and privacy. However, the act of deleting someone else's posts without permission is a privacy issue. The mom might feel that her property (the Facebook account) was tampered with, even if the content was about the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have her own reasons for sharing, perhaps thinking she was showing support or that the information wasn't sensitive. But the author had made their wishes clear, so the mom's action could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nLegally, the account is the mom's, so accessing it without permission could be a violation. But the situation is nuanced because it's a family matter. The key points are consent and respect for boundaries. The author's mental health and the explicit request not to share are important factors. However, using the mom's password to delete posts is a privacy invasion. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between respecting the author's privacy and the mom's right to manage her own account. The author acted out of a desire to protect their privacy and mental health, but the method (deleting without permission) is questionable. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the ends justify the means. The author had a valid reason for wanting privacy, but the method used (deleting posts without consent) is ethically problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. However, considering the mom's breach of the author's trust and the significant impact on the author's well-being, some might argue the author wasn't in the wrong. \n\nBut in terms of right vs. wrong actions, deleting someone else's posts without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of the motive. So, the answer might be A. However, the mom's initial breach is also an issue. But the question is specifically about the author's action. \n\nSo, the author violated the mom's privacy by accessing her account and deleting posts, which is a breach of trust in the other direction. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). But the mom also broke the author's trust. However, the question is about the author's wrongness. So, the answer would be A.\n"
