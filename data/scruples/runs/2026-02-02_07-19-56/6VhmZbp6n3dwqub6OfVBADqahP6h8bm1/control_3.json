Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their hospitalization for an eating disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in recovery and explicitly told their mom not to share details with people outside close family. The mom didn't follow that, posting on Facebook, which the author found upsetting because it exposed their personal health information to people they don't know, and the author isn't religious, so the prayer part was offensive.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The mom broke the agreement by sharing the author's sensitive information. The author then took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts without the mom's knowledge. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, the mom violated the author's privacy. On the other, the author took control by deleting the posts, which is a form of hacking or unauthorized access. Legally, using someone else's password to access their account is a violation of privacy terms of service. But ethically, the author had a valid reason because their consent was ignored. However, the method (deleting the posts without telling the mom) could be seen as dishonest. Maybe the author should have confronted the mom instead of acting covertly.\n\nBut the situation is complex. The author's mental health is a significant factor. They might have felt that confronting their mom would lead to more conflict or that the posts were causing them harm. However, the act of deleting the posts without permission is still a breach of trust and privacy, even if the intent was good.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. Legally, yes, because they accessed the account without permission. Morally, maybe not, given the mom's initial breach of privacy and the author's mental health. But the wrong action here is the unauthorized access, not necessarily the motivation. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their action, while understandable, was ethically and legally questionable.\n"
