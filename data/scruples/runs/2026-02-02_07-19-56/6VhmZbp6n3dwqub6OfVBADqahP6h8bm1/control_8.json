Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the person's mental health and their mom sharing personal information about their treatment without consent.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of anorexia and was in a residential treatment program. They explicitly told their mom not to share this information beyond close family. However, the mom posted about it on Facebook with a large audience, which the author found upsetting because it violated their privacy and they felt embarrassed about being defined by their illness. The author then deleted the posts without telling their mom.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The mom might argue that she was trying to get support and that the author didn't have the right to delete her posts. On the other hand, the author was clear about their wishes, and the mom didn't respect their boundaries. The author's mental health is a significant factor here, and the breach of privacy could have caused them distress. \n\nThe act of deleting the posts without permission is a gray area. While the author has a right to privacy, accessing someone else's account without permission is generally considered a violation of privacy. However, the mom's initial action of sharing private information without consent is the root issue. The author might have had a valid reason, but the method of deleting the posts could be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was justified. The author's intent was to protect their privacy, which is understandable given their mental health struggles. However, using the mom's password to delete the posts might not be the right approach. The correct course of action would have been to confront the mom directly once the posts were up. Since the author did act without permission, they might be in the wrong for accessing the account, even if the motive was good.\n\nBut considering the mom's breach of trust first, the author's reaction is more about correcting a violation of their initial agreement. The community might be more lenient given the mental health aspect and the mom's failure to respect boundaries. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the mom's actions were the initial problem. However, the method of deletion (using the password) is questionable. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, because the mom broke the agreement first, even if the deletion method was a privacy issue. But maybe the answer is A because the author shouldn't have accessed the account without permission. I'm a bit torn here.\n"
