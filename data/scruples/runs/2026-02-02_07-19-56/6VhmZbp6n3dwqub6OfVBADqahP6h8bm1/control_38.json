Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about them being hospitalized for an eating disorder. \n\nFirst, the author has mental health issues and was in a residential hospital. They told their mom not to share that info except with close family. The mom did post it on Facebook, which the author found and deleted because they didn't want strangers knowing. The mom is a social butterfly with many friends, so the author was upset that random people might see it and pity them.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and privacy. The mom violated the author's explicit request by sharing personal information publicly. The author deleted the posts to protect their privacy, which is understandable. But did they cross a line by deleting their mom's posts without her knowing? \n\nIn terms of the action itself, deleting someone else's Facebook posts without permission is against their autonomy. However, considering the context\u2014mental health, explicit request, potential harm from public exposure\u2014it's a privacy issue. The author might be justified in wanting to protect their privacy, especially if the mom's posts were non-consensual. \n\nOn the other hand, the author used their mom's password without permission, which is a violation of privacy. But maybe the mom's actions were the bigger issue here. The answer might depend on balancing the violation of the author's consent versus the act of deleting the posts. \n\nSince the mom broke the agreement, the author's action could be seen as a protective measure. Still, deleting without consent is a problem. However, given the circumstances, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to protect their privacy after a breach. The answer might be B (No), because the mom's actions were the main issue, and the author acted to correct a privacy violation.\n"
