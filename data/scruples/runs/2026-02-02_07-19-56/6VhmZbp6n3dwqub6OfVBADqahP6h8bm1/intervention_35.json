Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The author is in recovery from anorexia and had explicitly told their mom not to share their condition publicly. The mom, however, posted about sending the author to treatment on Facebook, which the author found offensive and violating their privacy. The author then deleted the posts because they didn't want people to pity them and because the mom has a lot of Facebook friends.\n\nSo, first, the key points here. The author had made their wishes clear to their mom, who agreed not to tell people except close family. The mom didn't follow through and instead posted publicly. The author, feeling violated and upset, took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate it. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author's mom did break her promise, which is a breach of trust. The author's mental health is a sensitive issue, and the mom's actions could have caused additional stress. The author's decision to delete the posts might be seen as protecting their privacy, which is important, especially during recovery. \n\nOn the other hand, the author used a deceptive method to delete the posts (using their mom's password without permission), which could be considered unethical or a violation of the mom's privacy. However, the mom's initial action was the problem. The author might not have other options if they couldn't confront the mom directly, maybe due to fear of conflict or the mom not listening. \n\nBut here's a conflict: the author is in recovery and might have emotional triggers. The mom's posts could be retraumatizing. The author's action, while unauthorized, could be a necessary step to protect their mental health. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, deleting someone else's posts without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of the intent. However, the context matters. The mom's breach of the agreement is the root issue. The author might not have other avenues to address this, especially if confronting the mom isn't an option. \n\nBut the act of deleting the posts without permission is still a violation of the mom's rights as a social media user. Even if the mom was wrong, the author's method of handling it could be problematic. There's a line between self-advocacy and overstepping boundaries. \n\nHowever, considering the author's mental health and the urgency of protecting their privacy, the action might be justified in their eyes. The key here is whether the author's action was a proportionate response. Since the mom had agreed not to share but did so anyway, the author might feel justified in taking action to correct the breach. \n\nBut from a strict ethical standpoint, deleting someone's posts without their consent is not acceptable, even if the content was harmful. The appropriate action would be to talk to the mom and address the issue directly. If that fails, perhaps informing Facebook or using other methods. \n\nIn summary, while the author's mom is at fault for breaking her promise, the author's unauthorized deletion is also problematic. However, given the context of mental health and the violation of privacy, some might argue the author's action is understandable. But legally and ethically, it's still a breach of the mom's privacy. So the answer might depend on the perspective\u2014strictly speaking, the author is in the wrong (A), but contextually, there's understanding.\n"
