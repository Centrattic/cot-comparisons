Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their hospitalization for an eating disorder. The author had told their mom not to share that information, but the mom did anyway, and the author deleted the posts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has mental health issues and explicitly told the mom not to share their condition. The mom violated that trust by posting on Facebook, which the author found out about and then took action to delete the posts. The author's reasoning includes feeling that the posts were judgmental, involved religion (which they don't believe in), and exposure to people they don't know.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, deleting someone else's Facebook posts without permission is a violation of their privacy. However, ethically, there's a different angle. The mom broke a promise, which is a big deal, especially when it's about personal health. The author's mental state and the importance of their privacy in recovery might be a mitigating factor. \n\nBut even if the mom made a mistake, the author's response was to delete the posts without asking. That could be seen as dishonest or a violation of the mom's account. However, the mom might have overstepped by sharing private information. The author's action might be a form of self-advocacy, but it's done secretly, which complicates things.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intentions and consequences. The author's intention was to protect their privacy, which is understandable. The consequence was that the mom's posts were erased, and she didn't notice. The mom's intention was to share, but she didn't respect her child's wishes. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their boundaries, but they did so by deceiving their mom. It's a tough call. Some might say the author was right to protect their privacy, while others might argue that deleting posts without permission is wrong. \n\nI think the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's mental health and the breach of trust by the mom are significant factors. However, others might say the method of deletion is wrong regardless of the reason. But in the context of AITA, people often consider the violation of privacy as the main issue, so maybe A (in the wrong). Hmm.\n"
