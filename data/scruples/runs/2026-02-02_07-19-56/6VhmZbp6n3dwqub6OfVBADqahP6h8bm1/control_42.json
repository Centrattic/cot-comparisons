Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is in recovery from multiple mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were in a residential hospital and explicitly told their mom not to share their situation with anyone except close family. The mom agreed. But then, the mom posted about the hospital stay on Facebook, which the author found out when they were scrolling through their mom's account looking for a family photo. The posts included details about being checked into a treatment facility and asking for prayers, which the author isn't religious. The author is upset because these posts were visible to 500+ friends they don't know, and they felt this was violating their privacy and causing pity. The author then deleted the posts using their mom's password, which they shared because the mom uses the same password for everything.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the ethical aspects here.\n\nOn one hand, the mom agreed not to share the information beyond close family. By posting on Facebook with many people, she broke that agreement. The author's privacy was compromised, which could be traumatic, especially for someone in recovery. The author might feel that their trust was betrayed, leading to actions to restore their privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author deleted the posts without the mom's consent. That's a breach of the mom's property (her Facebook account) even if the content was problematic. The author used the mom's password, which she might have shared herself, but that doesn't make it right. The author's action could be seen as a violation of the mom's autonomy and right to manage her own social media, even if the content was inappropriate.\n\nBut considering the context, the author's mental health is a significant factor. They were in recovery and the mom's actions could have negatively impacted their mental state. The author's motivation was to protect their privacy and emotional well-being, which is understandable. However, the method used (deleting without consent) is ethically questionable. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting the mom's actions and protecting one's own privacy. The author might have a valid reason, but the action taken is invasive. However, sometimes in such situations, especially with vulnerable individuals, the line between right and wrong can be blurred. The key here is whether the author's action was justified given the circumstances.\n\nAnother angle: the mom had a responsibility to respect the author's wishes. By not doing so, she was in the wrong. The author's response, while not ideal, was a reaction to a breach of trust. But the act of deleting without consent might have been necessary to prevent further harm. In some ethical frameworks, the ends (protecting privacy) might justify the means (deleting the posts), but usually, consent is a key factor.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the mom violated their trust. But the action taken was a privacy violation. However, given the context of mental health and the mom's breach of confidentiality, the author's action might be seen as a necessary step to protect their own well-being. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
