Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their mom's Facebook posts is in the wrong. The situation involves the person being in recovery from anorexia and having told their mom not to share their condition publicly. The mom did so anyway, leading the person to delete the posts without the mom's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person made it explicit that they didn't want their illness shared beyond close family. The mom, however, posted about it on Facebook with many friends, which the person found unacceptable. The person then deleted the posts using their mom's known password, which the mom uses for everything.\n\nLegally, deleting someone else's posts without permission could be an issue, but the question here is about moral or social wrongness. The person's actions were motivated by a desire to protect their privacy and mental health, which is understandable. However, the method used\u2014deleting without permission\u2014might be seen as violating trust or privacy.\n\nOn one hand, the mom broke the agreement by sharing private information. The person might feel justified in taking action to protect themselves. On the other hand, the person accessed the mom's account without consent, which is a breach of privacy. The debate here is whether the ends (protecting privacy) justify the means (deleting posts without permission).\n\nAlso, the person's mental health is a significant factor. They are in recovery and might be more sensitive to public scrutiny. The mom's posts could have caused emotional distress. However, the person's response could be seen as taking control of the situation but in a way that might harm the trust between them.\n\nIt's a nuanced situation. The person might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their privacy as agreed, but the method could be questioned. However, others might argue that they should have communicated with the mom first instead of taking unilateral action. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about privacy and consent.\n"
