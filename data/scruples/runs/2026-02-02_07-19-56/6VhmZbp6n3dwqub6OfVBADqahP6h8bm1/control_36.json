Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their hospitalization for an eating disorder. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is in recovery from mental illnesses, specifically anorexia. They explicitly told their mom not to share their condition publicly, and their mom agreed. However, the mom posted about it on Facebook, which the author found offensive because it's not a religious person and the posts asked for prayers. The mom has 500+ friends, many strangers to the author. The author deleted the posts using their mom's password, which they knew because the mom uses the same password everywhere. The author hasn't been caught yet.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. The author had a clear boundary set with their mom, and the mom violated that by posting publicly. The author's action was to delete the posts to protect their privacy and prevent pity from strangers. However, the method used was hacking into their mom's account, which is a breach of privacy and trust.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a legitimate reason for wanting privacy, especially during recovery. Public posts could lead to unwanted attention and stigma. On the other hand, deleting posts without consent is a violation of someone else's account. Even if the author had good intentions, the act itself is unauthorized and could be seen as manipulative or a breach of trust.\n\nThe mom might feel that she has the right to share her daughter's story, perhaps believing she was being supportive or that others could offer help. But the daughter's explicit request was to keep it private. The mom's agreement was broken, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action was to protect their own well-being, which is understandable. However, the means of doing so\u2014without consent\u2014might be ethically questionable. The mom might feel betrayed not just by the posts but by the deception about deleting them. The author's justification is about privacy and not wanting pity, which is valid, but the method used is problematic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The violation of the mom's account is a breach of privacy, but the author's intent was to protect their own mental health. Depending on perspective, some might see the author as justified, others as wrong for the method. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the key issue is the unauthorized access. That's a clear ethical violation regardless of intent. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the context of mental health and the mom's breach of an agreement, some might argue that the author's actions were a necessary response to protect their well-being, making B (No) the answer. But the act of deleting without consent is still a privacy issue. It's a tough call, but I think the unauthorized access is a key point here. So, the author is in the wrong for hacking into their mom's account, even if the intent was good. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
