Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author's mental health and the mother sharing details about their treatment without consent.\n\nFirst, the author was in recovery from anorexia and explicitly told their mom not to share their condition beyond close family. The mom, however, posted about the hospitalization on Facebook with 500 friends. The author deleted the posts because they felt it violated their privacy and caused them distress, especially since they're not religious and dislike pity.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and privacy. The author had clearly communicated their wishes, so the mom's action was a breach of that. The author's decision to delete the posts was a direct response to protect their privacy. However, deleting someone else's content without permission is a gray area. Legally, the mom's posts were public, so the author didn't own them. But ethically, the mother may have overstepped by sharing private information against the author's wishes.\n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to privacy and took action to protect it, which is understandable. On the other hand, the method they used\u2014deleting without telling\u2014could be seen as dishonest. But given the context of mental health and the mother's breach of trust, the author's actions might be more about self-preservation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we focus on the method, yes, deleting without permission isn't ideal. But considering the mother's violation of the explicit agreement, the author's actions are a reaction to protect their well-being. It's a tough call, but the mother is at fault for sharing private info. The author's action, while not perfect, is a response to that breach. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
