Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their hospitalization. The person is in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia. They made it clear to their mom that they didn't want the news shared beyond close family, and the mom agreed. But then the mom posted about it on Facebook with a lot of friends, which the person found out when they were scrolling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had explicitly told their mom not to share the information beyond close family and relatives. The mom broke that trust by posting publicly. The author then deleted the posts themselves because they were upset about the public exposure, especially the pity aspect, which is really hard for someone in recovery. \n\nNow, the main ethical issues here are privacy and consent. The mom violated the trust by sharing private information without permission. The author, feeling that their privacy was invaded, took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts. \n\nBut is the author wrong for doing that? Well, hacking into someone's account is generally wrong because it's a violation of their privacy. Even if the mom did something the author didn't like, the author shouldn't have accessed her account without permission. However, the author's actions were motivated by a desire to protect their own privacy and mental health. \n\nOn one hand, the mom broke the agreement, which is a problem. On the other, the author circumvented their mom's account, which is also a privacy violation. So, there's a conflict here. The author might be in the wrong for using underhanded methods, but the mom's actions were also a breach of trust. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. Since they used their mom's password without consent, that's a privacy violation regardless of the reason. Even if the reason is understandable, the method is not. So technically, the author is in the wrong for deleting the posts without their mom's permission. However, some might argue the context of mental health and the mom's breach makes it more nuanced. But from a strict standpoint, unauthorized access to someone's account is wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
