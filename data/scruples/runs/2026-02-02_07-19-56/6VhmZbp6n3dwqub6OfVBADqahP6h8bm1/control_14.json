Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. \n\nFirst, the author has a history of mental illness and was in a residential treatment program. They explicitly told their mom not to share their condition publicly except with close family. The mom, however, posted about it on Facebook, which the author discovered while searching for a family photo. \n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The author didn't want their illness public, and the mom broke that agreement. The author then used their mom's password (since she uses the same one for everything) to delete the posts. \n\nNow, considering the right and wrong here. The mom definitely overstepped by sharing private information against the author's wishes. But the author violated their mom's privacy by accessing her account and deleting posts. \n\nIs it justifiable? Maybe the author felt strongly about their privacy, especially given their mental health struggles. However, using someone else's login without permission is a breach of trust. Even if the mom was wrong, the author's method of addressing it was also wrong. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's mental health. They might be in a vulnerable state. However, the act of deleting posts without consent is still an invasion of privacy. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they violated their mom's privacy, even if the mom was also wrong for posting without consent. Both parties made mistakes, but the act of deleting without permission is a clear breach.\n"
