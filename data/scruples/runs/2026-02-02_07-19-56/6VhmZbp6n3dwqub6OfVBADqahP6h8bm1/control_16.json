Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author having mental health issues, specifically anorexia, and being in a residential treatment program. They told their mom not to share this information beyond close family, but the mom did it anyway on Facebook. The author then deleted the posts because they were upset about the pity and the public exposure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities here. The author's mom posted something private on social media, which the author had explicitly asked her not to do. The mom violated the author's privacy. However, the author took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts without her knowledge. \n\nNow, the key points: Did the author have the right to delete the posts? The mom's Facebook account is her own, so the author isn't the owner. Deleting posts without permission could be seen as a violation of the mom's property. But the mom also broke a trust by sharing private information, which caused distress to the author. \n\nThe author was in recovery and might be in a vulnerable state. The mom's actions could have harmed the author's mental health by exposing them to pity and judgment from strangers. The author's motivation was to protect themselves, which can be understood. However, the method they used\u2014deleting without consent\u2014might be questionable. \n\nIs there a better way? Maybe the author should have talked to their mom about it first. But if the author felt that communication wasn't effective or the mom didn't take it seriously, maybe they felt it was necessary. \n\nLegally, accessing someone else's account without permission is a no-go. Ethically, it's a gray area. The mom breached confidentiality, and the author acted to reclaim their privacy. But the act of deleting posts without consent could be seen as a breach of trust in the opposite direction. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the ends justify the means. The author's action was to protect their privacy and mental health, which is valid. However, using unauthorized access to do so is problematic. Different people might see it differently. Some might say the mom was wrong first, making the author's action a justified response. Others would argue that the author shouldn't have accessed their mom's account regardless of the reason. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at whether someone's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. The mom definitely violated the author's trust. The author's response was a direct action to fix that issue, but without communication. The right approach might have been to confront the mom first. However, if the author couldn't do that safely or effectively, maybe their action was necessary. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the mom violated the agreement, and the author acted to protect themselves. But I'm not 100% sure. There's a balance between respecting boundaries and protecting one's privacy. The author's method was questionable, but their intent was understandable. In AITA context, maybe they aren't the asshole because the mom was wrong first. So the answer is B.\n"
