Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author being in recovery from an eating disorder and not wanting their condition shared publicly. The mom posted about it on Facebook, which upset the author, so they deleted the posts without telling her.\n\nFirst, the author had explicitly told their mom not to share their illness with people beyond close family. The mom didn't respect that boundary, which is a key point. The author's mental health is a sensitive issue, and the mom's posts could have caused embarrassment or stigma. Since the mom has many Facebook friends, the posts might have spread the information more than intended.\n\nHowever, deleting someone else's posts without their knowledge is a privacy violation. The author used their mom's login credentials, which is a breach of trust. Even though the author had a valid reason, the method they used to address the issue was inappropriate. Instead of deleting the posts themselves, they should have confronted their mom directly and asked her to remove them. This would have maintained honesty and addressed the issue without breaking into her account.\n\nSo, the author's action was a violation of privacy, which is wrong, even if their intentions were to protect their mental health. The right approach would have been to communicate their feelings to their mom and ask her to delete the posts respectfully. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
