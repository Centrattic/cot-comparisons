Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation is that the author was in a residential hospital for anorexia and had explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with people except close family. The mom, however, posted on Facebook about checking the author into treatment, which the author found upsetting because it exposed their illness to many people, including non-religious ones, and the author doesn't like pity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's mom broke a promise by sharing the information publicly, and the author deleted the posts themselves because they were against it. The mom has over 500 Facebook friends, which the author considers strangers, and the posts made the author feel defined by their illness. The author isn't religious, so the mention of prayers bothered them. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The main ethical issues here are privacy, consent, and the method used. The author's mom was supposed to keep the information private but shared it, potentially violating the author's explicit request. The author, in response, accessed their mom's account without permission to delete the posts. That's a breach of privacy in itself. \n\nSo, the author's action was a violation of their mom's privacy, even if their intention was to protect their own. Telling someone not to share information is a request, but accessing their account without consent is a different kind of wrongdoing. However, the mom also didn't follow through on her promise. \n\nThe dilemma is between two wrongs: the mom violating the author's privacy and the author retaliating by violating their mom's. In many cases, even if someone is wronged, taking similar actions (like the \"two wrongs make a right\" approach) isn't considered justified. The author could have addressed the issue by talking to their mom instead of deleting the posts themselves. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's mental health. They're in recovery and might be very sensitive about how their condition is perceived. The mom's posts could be causing them significant emotional distress. However, the act of deleting without consent is still a privacy violation. \n\nThe answer might depend on the perspective. If the mom's actions were clearly in violation of an agreement, the author's intent was to protect their privacy. But the method involved accessing someone else's account, which is ethically questionable. So, the author is in the wrong for the method, even if the mom was wrong in the first place. The right approach would have been to confront the mom and not to delete the posts themselves.\n"
