Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author being in recovery from anorexia and their mom sharing posts about their hospitalization on Facebook, which the author didn't want.\n\nFirst, the author explicitly told their mom not to share this information beyond close family. The mom broke that promise by posting on Facebook, which has over 500 friends, many of whom the author doesn't know. The author then deleted the posts because they were upset about the privacy breach and the pity they didn't want. \n\nI need to consider privacy and consent here. The mom shared personal health information without the author's consent, which is a violation of their wishes. The author might feel violated and act on their own to rectify the situation. However, hacking into someone's account (even if they have the same password) is technically unauthorized access, which could be illegal. \n\nBut there's context: the author is in recovery and mental health issues are sensitive. The mom's actions could hinder the author's recovery by exposing them to pity and stigma. The author's action was to protect their privacy, but the method involved deleting the posts without permission. \n\nLegally, unauthorized access to someone's account is a problem, but morally, there's a strong argument that the author was protecting their privacy and mental health. The key points are the violation of an explicit promise, the importance of mental health privacy, and the author's intent to prevent further harm. \n\nSo, while the action might be legally questionable, morally, the author might not be in the wrong. The mom broke the agreement first, and the author acted out of a desire to maintain their privacy and well-being.\n"
