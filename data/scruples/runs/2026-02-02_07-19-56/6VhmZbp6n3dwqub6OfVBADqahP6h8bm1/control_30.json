Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in recovery from multiple mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were in a residential hospital and explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with anyone except close family friends and relatives. The mom agreed but later posted about it on Facebook, which the author found offensive and privacy-violating. The author deleted the posts without the mom's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the author's mental health is a key factor here. They might be particularly sensitive to public exposure of their condition, which can be a valid concern. The mom, despite agreeing not to share, did post it, possibly breaching the trust. The author's action was to delete the posts to protect their privacy, which they felt was invaded. \n\nHowever, deleting someone else's posts without permission is a privacy violation, even if the motive is good. The author used their mom's password, which is another issue. They should have addressed it with their mom directly instead of taking matters into their own hands. The mom's action was wrong, but the author's response might not be the right way to handle it. So, while the author has valid reasons, their method of deleting the posts without consent could be considered wrong.\n"
