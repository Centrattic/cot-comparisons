Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation is that the author was in a residential treatment center for an eating disorder, had explicitly told their mom not to share this information beyond close family, but the mom did anyway. The author then deleted the posts because they were upset about people pitying them, especially since they aren't religious. The mom is a social person with many friends, so the author was worried about being defined by their illness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had given a clear instruction to their mom, who agreed but then didn't follow through. The author felt violated and embarrassed. The action taken was deleting the posts without the mom's knowledge. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFactors to consider: \n- Did the mom breach a trust by posting about the author's private health information? Probably, since the author had made it clear. \n- The author's mental health is a sensitive issue, and the mom's actions might have caused distress. \n- The author's action was to delete the posts to prevent further harm. But was it right for the author to delete them without consent?\n\nHowever, there's a principle here of respecting others' property and privacy. The mom's Facebook account is hers, so the author deleting her posts could be seen as a violation. But there's the counterpoint that the mom violated the author's privacy first. The author's mental health and the explicit agreement the mom agreed to come into play here. \n\nBut ethically, even if someone else is wrong, does that justify a similar violation? For example, if someone breaks a trust, does the other person have the right to retaliate in a similar way? Or is there a better approach, like talking to the mom about it?\n\nThe author's reasoning is understandable\u2014feeling that their privacy was invaded and not wanting pity. However, the method of addressing it by deleting the posts without the mom's knowledge might be considered the wrong action. While the mom made a mistake, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlternatively, considering the mental health context, some might argue that the author's actions were justified because the posts were causing them significant distress and violating their wishes. But legally and in terms of privacy, the author accessed their mom's account without permission, which is another issue. Even if the mom used the same password, the act of logging in without her consent would be problematic.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's action (deleting posts) is a forgivable response to the mom's breach, or if it's another violation. In an \"Am I the Asshole\" context, people often consider both actions. The mom broke a promise, which is a major issue, but the author also acted without permission. Depending on the perspective, the author might be seen as justified in protecting their privacy, but also as wrong for not handling it through communication. \n\nIn many such discussions, people often take the perspective that the initial breach was worse, so the author isn't the asshole. However, deleting without asking is still a privacy violation. But given the context of mental health and the mom's social media habits, some might side with the author. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the mom violated the author's privacy and explicit wishes, and the author acted to protect themselves from further harm, even if the method was questionable. The context of mental health and the desire to avoid pity and being defined by illness adds weight to the author's actions. However, this is a nuanced situation where neither party is entirely right or wrong, but the question is whether the author is the asshole. Since the mom was the one who broke the agreement, the author's retaliation, while not ideal, is more understandable in this scenario.\n"
