Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The person is in recovery from anorexia and other mental illnesses. They were hospitalized and specifically told their mom not to share their condition publicly except with close family. The mom did post on Facebook about it, which the person found upsetting because it violated their privacy and they weren't religious, so the prayer part was uncomfortable. They deleted the posts since their mom used the same password.\n\nFirst, the person had clearly communicated their wishes. The mom didn't respect that, which is a breach of trust. The person's reaction was about protecting their privacy, which is important, especially with mental health. Deleting the posts might be seen as a way to correct the mom's violation. \n\nBut, did the person have the right to delete their mom's posts without asking? That's a gray area. However, considering the mom reused passwords and the posts were public, maybe the person felt it was necessary. The mom's actions were the initial wrong, so the person might be justified in correcting it. \n\nMental health privacy is crucial here. The person might be trying to avoid stigma and protect their recovery. The mom's social media habits could expose the person to unwanted attention. Deleting the posts was a way to prevent further harm. \n\nBut on the other hand, deleting someone else's posts without permission is a privacy invasion. However, since the mom shared personal info without consent, the person's action might be seen as protecting their own privacy. \n\nSo, considering the mom violated the person's explicit request, the person's action was to protect their privacy and mental health. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
