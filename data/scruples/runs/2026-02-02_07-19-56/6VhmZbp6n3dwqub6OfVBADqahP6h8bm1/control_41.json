Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who deleted their mom's Facebook posts is in the wrong. The situation is about a person in recovery for an eating disorder. They told their mom not to share their situation publicly, but the mom did anyway. The person then deleted the posts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the privacy aspect. The user explicitly told their mom not to tell people beyond close family, but the mom posted on Facebook with many friends. That's a breach of trust. The user had a right to be upset because their personal health issue was shared without consent. However, deleting someone else's posts without their knowledge is a violation of privacy and trust too. \n\nBut wait, there's a context here. The user is in recovery and sensitive about their condition. The mom's posts were on a public platform, which could expose the user to unwanted attention and pity. The user might have felt that the posts were harmful to their recovery. \n\nOn the other hand, the user used their mom's password to delete the posts. That's a security issue. Even if the intent was good, accessing someone's account without permission is generally wrong. So there's a conflict here between respecting the mom's privacy and protecting their own boundaries.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The mom broke the agreement by sharing the information, but the user's method of correcting that breach involved unethical actions. So maybe the user isn't entirely at fault, but they did something wrong by hacking into the account. However, the mom's actions were the initial problem. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the user had a right to protect their privacy, especially given their mental health. But others might say that the user should have talked to their mom first instead of deleting the posts. \n\nConsidering all factors, the user acted out of a desire to protect their privacy, but the method was problematic. However, the primary wrong was the mom's for not respecting the user's wishes. The user's actions were a response to that violation. It's a complex situation where both parties made mistakes, but the user's action was a direct response to protect themselves. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a middle ground, but according to the options given, it's either A or B. Since the user acted to protect their privacy in the context of the mom's breach, even though the method was questionable, the user's intent was to correct a wrong. So maybe B is the right answer.\n"
