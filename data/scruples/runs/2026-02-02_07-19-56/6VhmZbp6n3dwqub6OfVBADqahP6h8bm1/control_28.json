Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts.\n\nThe situation is that the author is in recovery from mental illnesses, specifically anorexia. They were in a residential hospital and explicitly told their mom not to tell people except close family. But the mom posted about it on Facebook, which the author found upsetting because it violated their privacy and included religious elements they don't believe in. The author then deleted the posts without the mom's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had made clear their wishes to keep the information private. The mom didn't follow through, which is a breach of trust. The author felt that the posts exposed them to people they don't know, leading to pity, which they hate. Their action was to delete the posts, which is a direct response to protect their privacy.\n\nOn the flip side, deleting someone else's posts without their consent is an invasion of privacy. Even if the mom made a mistake, the author took it upon themselves to remove the content. There might be a better way to handle it, like talking to the mom first. However, the context is that the author is in a vulnerable state, dealing with mental health issues, and felt that the posts were harmful to their recovery.\n\nI need to weigh the breach of trust against the act of deleting the posts. The author's action was to prevent further harm, but the method was unethical. But maybe in the context of their mental health and the mom's failure to respect boundaries, the author's intent is understandable. However, the act of deleting someone's posts without permission is still a violation of the mom's rights, regardless of the reason. \n\nSo, while the author had valid reasons, the action itself is problematic. The correct answer might be that they are in the wrong because you shouldn't delete someone else's content without talking to them first. But some might argue that the mom violated the author's privacy first, so the author's action is justified. It's a bit of a grey area.\n\nBut legally and ethically, you can't delete someone's posts just because you don't like them, even if there's a good reason. The proper step would be to address the issue with the mom, not take matters into your own hands. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
