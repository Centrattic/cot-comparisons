Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their mom's Facebook posts is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were in a residential hospital and explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with anyone except close family and friends. The mom agreed. However, the mom later posted on Facebook about checking the author into treatment, which the author found upsetting because it violated their privacy and included religious references, which the author isn't into. The mom has over 500 friends, many strangers, and the author didn't want people to define them by their illness. So the author deleted the posts without the mom's knowledge.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's main concern was privacy and respecting their wishes. They had made their boundaries clear, so the mom breaking that trust could be an issue. However, the author took the action of deleting the posts without permission. The mom didn't ask for the author's consent before posting, which was a breach of their agreement. But the author's response was to delete the posts without discussing it first. \n\nFrom a privacy perspective, the mom's actions were invasive and went against the agreement. The author had a right to be upset. However, deleting someone else's posts without their knowledge could be seen as a violation of trust as well. The author might have a valid reason, but the method could be questionable. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014that the author is in recovery and the posts were spreading sensitive information beyond agreed-upon people\u2014it's possible that the author's actions were protective of their mental health. The mom's posts could have caused emotional distress and public scrutiny, which the author was trying to avoid. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The mom definitely broke a promise, which is a significant issue. The author's deletion might be a reaction to that breach, but it's not the best way to handle it. The right approach would have been to talk to the mom first. However, given the mom's history of not respecting the author's privacy, the author might have felt that deleting the posts was necessary to protect themselves. \n\nLegally, deleting someone's posts without permission could be an issue, but the question is about being in the wrong ethically or morally. Since the mom violated the agreement first, the author's actions could be seen as a response to protect their own well-being. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it differently. However, based on the situation, the answer is probably B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong because the mom broke their agreement, and the author was protecting their privacy and mental health.\n"
