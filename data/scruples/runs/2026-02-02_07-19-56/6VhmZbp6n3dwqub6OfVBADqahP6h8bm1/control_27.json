Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their mom's Facebook posts is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being in recovery from mental illnesses like anorexia and having explicitly told their mom not to share their condition publicly. The mom, however, posted about their hospitalization on Facebook with a large audience, which upset the author. The author then deleted these posts using their mom's shared password.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had clear boundaries set before entering the hospital, which the mom agreed to. The mom's actions violated those boundaries by sharing personal health information on a public platform. The author's mental health is a significant factor here, as public pity is something they find unbearable. \n\nOn one hand, deleting someone else's posts without their knowledge is a breach of privacy and trust. However, the mom broke a prior agreement, which might justify the author's actions in their eyes. The author's mental health and the violation of their confidentiality are critical aspects. \n\nLegally, while Facebook posts are public, the act of deleting them without permission is a privacy issue. Ethically, it's about respecting the agreement and the individual's need for privacy. The author's actions were a response to a breach of trust, which complicates the moral judgment. \n\nThe author's motivation was to protect their privacy and mental well-being, which is understandable. But the method of deletion without consent could be seen as crossing a line. However, given the mom's initial violation of the agreement, the author's actions might be viewed as a necessary step to maintain their boundaries. \n\nConsidering all factors, while the author's method was questionable, their intent was rooted in protecting their mental health and privacy. The mom's actions were the primary breach. So the answer might lean towards B (No), but there's a nuance because the author did act without consent.\n"
