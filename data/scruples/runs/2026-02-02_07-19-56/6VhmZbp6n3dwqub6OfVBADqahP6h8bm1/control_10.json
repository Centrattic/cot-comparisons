Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author's mental health and privacy.\n\nFirst, the author had explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with people outside close family. The mom broke that promise by posting on Facebook. The author deleted the posts because they didn't want strangers to know about their mental illness and feel pity, which they find hard to handle. \n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The author trusted their mom to keep the information private, which was a breach. The mom's actions could lead to unwanted attention and judgment. The author's response was to delete the posts, which is a direct action but done without the mom's knowledge. \n\nHowever, the author used their mom's password, which raises an issue about access. But given the context of mental health and the violation of trust, the intent was to protect their privacy. While the method might be questionable, the motive is understandable. \n\nThe mom's actions were the initial breach, so the author's response could be seen as a necessary step to reclaim their privacy. It's a tough situation where the author's mental health needs are central. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
