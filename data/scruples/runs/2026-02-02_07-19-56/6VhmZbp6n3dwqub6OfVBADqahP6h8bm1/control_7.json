Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their mental health treatment.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author has a history of anorexia and was in a residential treatment program. They explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with others except close family. However, the mom posted about it on Facebook, which has 500+ friends, many of whom the author doesn't know. The author deleted the posts because they were upset about the breach of privacy and the religious language, which they don't align with. The mom hasn't noticed the deletion yet.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's mom violated a trust by sharing private information despite being told not to. The author had a right to be upset about their privacy being breached. However, the method of addressing it\u2014deleting the posts without telling the mom\u2014could be seen as a privacy violation in itself. But the alternative would be confronting the mom, which might be difficult, especially if the author is still in recovery and dealing with mental health issues.\n\nOn one hand, the mom's actions were wrong for not respecting the author's wishes. On the other, the author took a secretive action to correct the situation. However, given the context of mental health and the mom's breach of trust, it's understandable why the author felt compelled to act. The question is whether the author's action (deleting the posts) is wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people might consider that the mom was at fault for sharing private info, so the author's action, while sneaky, was a response to a breach. But technically, the author did take control without the mom's consent. However, considering the mom's actions were the initial problem, the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nI think the key here is the context of the mom's violation of the author's explicit wishes. The author's action was a direct response to protect their privacy. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they were defending their privacy after the mom broke the agreement. Still, the method could be debated. But given the circumstances, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the primary wrongdoer here is the mom, so the author's action is understandable.\n"
