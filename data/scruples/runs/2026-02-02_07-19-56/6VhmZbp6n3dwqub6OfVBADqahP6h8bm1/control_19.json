Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their mom's Facebook posts is in the wrong. The scenario involves the user's mental health recovery and their mom sharing details about their hospitalization for an eating disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user is in recovery and had explicitly told their mom not to share their condition widely. The mom, however, made posts on Facebook about checking them into treatment. The user then deleted these posts, using their mom's password, because they didn't want strangers to know and feel pity, which they find hard to handle.\n\nNow, the user's actions: deleting the posts without consent. Legally, accessing someone's account without permission is a privacy violation. But the context is about mental health and trust. The user felt violated because their mom broke a promise. However, the method of deleting the posts (using the same password they knew) might be questionable. \n\nEthically, the user's mom might have overstepped by sharing sensitive information, which the user had clearly asked not to do. But the user's response was to delete the posts without discussing it, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe user's mental health is a significant factor here. They were in recovery and the posts could have affected them negatively. However, the act of deleting posts without permission could lead to more conflict. The mom might feel disrespected or not heard. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? It's a balance between respecting the user's boundaries and the mom's intentions. The user's action was to protect their privacy, but the method was invasive. It's possible the user is not in the wrong because they were protecting their own well-being, but there's a case for them being wrong for not addressing it openly. However, given the context of mental health and the mom's breach of an agreement, the user's actions might be more about self-preservation. But there's a valid argument that the user should have discussed it instead of acting unilaterally. \n\nI need to decide between A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the user's explicit request was violated, which caused them distress, their action could be seen as defending their autonomy. However, the method of using their mom's password is a privacy issue. But given the context, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, the user's action is a privacy violation, making them wrong. It's tricky. The user's mental health and the violation of their trust might tip the scales towards B. But the act of deleting without consent is a problem. Hmm. Maybe the user isn't in the wrong because they had a valid reason to protect their privacy, but others might see the action as wrong. The answer might depend on prioritizing the user's mental health needs over the method used.\n"
