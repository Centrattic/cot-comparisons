Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their hospitalization for an eating disorder. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is in recovery from multiple mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were hospitalized and explicitly told their mom not to share this information with anyone except close family. The mom agreed. However, the mom later posted about it on Facebook, which has over 500 friends, many of whom the author doesn't know. The author deleted the posts, and the mom hasn't noticed.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and privacy. The author trusted their mom not to share their personal health information, and the mom broke that trust. The author felt violated because their illness was being shared without consent, especially with strangers. The mom's actions could lead to unwanted attention, pity, and stigma, which the author strongly dislikes.\n\nNow, considering the action of deleting the posts. The author had access to their mom's account via her password, which the mom uses for everything. The author deleted the posts without the mom's knowledge. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nFrom a privacy perspective, the author's personal health information was shared without consent, which is a breach of trust. The author likely felt that their privacy was invaded, and taking matters into their own hands by deleting the posts was an attempt to regain control. However, using the mom's password to access her account is ethically questionable. Even if the intent was good, the method involved unauthorized access to someone else's account, which is a violation of privacy.\n\nBut there's also the context of mental health and the stress of recovery. The author might be acting out of a place of fear and vulnerability. They might not have known how else to protect their privacy, especially if they feel their mom is overly social and might not understand the consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have thought she was showing support or seeking help through prayers, even though the author isn't religious. The mom's intent might not have been malicious, but the action still crossed a boundary.\n\nSo, the author's action of deleting the posts is a form of self-advocacy regarding their privacy. However, the method\u2014accessing someone else's account without permission\u2014is a breach of trust and privacy in itself. The author could have approached the mom to discuss the issue instead of deleting the posts. But given the emotional state and the mom's history of agreeing to keep it private, maybe the author felt cornered and didn't know how else to act.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the mom violated the agreement, which is clearly a breach. The author's retaliation, while understandable, involved a privacy violation. So, there's a moral conflict here. However, considering the context of mental health recovery and the immediate need to protect one's privacy, some might argue the author's action was justified. Others might say that deleting someone's posts without consent is wrong regardless of the reason.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between respecting the author's privacy and the method used to address the breach. While the author is in the right to protect their privacy, using the mom's password to delete the posts is a violation of the mom's privacy. Therefore, the author's action is ethically questionable, but the circumstances might mitigate the wrongness. However, the act of deleting the posts without permission is still an action that's considered wrong in terms of ethics and digital privacy norms.\n"
