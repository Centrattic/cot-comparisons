Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their mom's Facebook posts is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mental health recovery and their mom sharing details about it on Facebook.\n\nFirst, the author was in a residential hospital for an eating disorder and explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with others except close family. The mom agreed but then posted about it on Facebook, which the author found upsetting. The author deleted the posts because they didn't want strangers to know and felt pitied. \n\nSo the key points are: the author's consent was given to only close family, the mom violated that by posting on a public platform with many friends, the author felt humiliated and wanted privacy. The author took action by deleting the posts without the mom's knowledge. \n\nNow, considering privacy and consent. The mom agreed not to share, but she did anyway. The author's mental health is involved, so this is sensitive. The act of deleting might be seen as taking control over one's own narrative, but it's done without consent. On the other hand, the mom breached a trust. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, deleting someone else's posts without permission could be a privacy issue, but in this context, the mom's actions were the initial breach. The author's action was a response to protect their own privacy. It's a conflict between the mom's actions and the author's boundaries. \n\nLegally, maybe not wrong, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's intent was to protect their privacy, which is understandable. However, the method of deletion without discussion could lead to future issues. But in the context of mental health and respecting prior consent, the author's action seems justified. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
