Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person has a history of anorexia and was in residential treatment. They explicitly told their mom not to share their condition publicly except with close family. But the mom did post about it on Facebook, which the person found offensive for a couple of reasons: it's not religious, and the mom has many Facebook friends the person doesn't know. The person then deleted the posts without telling their mom.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The person was very clear about their wishes. The mom agreed but didn't follow through. The person felt violated and upset because the posts exposed their condition to people they didn't want to know. The action was deleting the posts. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, they might have broken the trust by not respecting their mom's privacy by deleting her posts. But the mom also broke a promise. The person had a valid reason for their mental health, but invading someone's privacy is generally frowned upon. However, the mom's actions were also a breach of confidentiality. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. On one hand, the person had the right to their privacy. On the other, deleting someone's posts without consent is a privacy invasion. The person might have handled it differently, like talking to their mom first. But given the emotional context and the mom's breach, maybe their actions are understandable. \n\nI need to check if the person's actions are ethically wrong. While deleting the posts was a privacy violation, the mom's initial action was also a breach. The person might be justified in their anger, but the method was questionable. However, considering the mental health aspect and the mom's breach, some might side with the person. \n\nI think the answer depends on how society views both actions. If the person's intent was to protect their privacy and mental health, some might say they're justified. Others might argue that they should've communicated instead of deleting. So it's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of right and wrong, maybe the person isn't entirely in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
