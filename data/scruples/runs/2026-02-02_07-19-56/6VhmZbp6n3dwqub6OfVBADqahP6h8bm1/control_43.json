Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their hospitalization for an eating disorder. The user is in recovery and had specifically told their mom not to share this information beyond close family. The mom, however, posted on Facebook, which the user found upsetting because it exposed their condition to people they don't know, and the posts included religious elements they don't believe in.\n\nSo, the user's mom broke the agreement by posting publicly. The user then deleted the posts because they felt violated and were concerned about privacy and pity. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for deleting the posts.\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, the mom didn't respect the user's boundaries, which is a big deal. The user had a legitimate reason to be upset. However, the user took matters into their own hands by deleting the posts without telling their mom. While the mom is at fault for breaching the agreement, the user's method of dealing with it might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy as well. The user used their mom's password, which is another issue because accessing someone else's account without permission is generally not okay, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, there's a conflict here. On one hand, the mom violated the user's privacy. On the other, the user violated their mom's privacy by deleting the posts. The user's actions were a reaction to the mom's breach, but the method might be questionable. However, given the context of the user's mental health and the violation of their stated wishes, some might argue it's understandable. But technically, the user did something they shouldn't have done, even if their intention was good. So maybe the answer depends on how the situation is viewed: the mom's wrongdoing vs. the user's breach of privacy.\n"
