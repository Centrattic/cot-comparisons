Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of mental illness, including anorexia, and was hospitalized. They explicitly told their mom not to share their condition with people outside close family. The mom, however, posted about the hospitalization on Facebook with 500+ friends, many of whom the author doesn't know. The author deleted the posts because they didn't want strangers to know about their illness and feel pity, which they hate. The mom hasn't noticed yet.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and privacy. The author clearly communicated their wishes to their mom, and the mom didn't respect that. The author's action was to protect their privacy, which is important, especially with mental health issues. However, deleting someone else's posts without permission is a breach of trust. But given the context\u2014mental health, explicit prior agreement, and the mom's violation of that agreement\u2014it's more about the mom's actions being the main issue. The author's intent was to protect their privacy, which is a valid concern. The method might be questionable, but the underlying issue is the mom's breach of trust. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
