Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author having mental health issues, specifically anorexia, and being in a residential hospital. They told their mom not to share their condition publicly, and the mom did anyway. The author then deleted the posts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it explicit that they didn't want their illness discussed beyond close family. The mom went against that and posted on Facebook, which has a lot of friends the author doesn't know. The author deleted the posts without telling their mom.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel their privacy was violated. They might be in a vulnerable state, and public posts could lead to unwanted attention or pity. The mom's actions could have caused additional stress or stigma for the author. The act of deleting the posts was done to protect their privacy, albeit without the mom's consent. However, the act of deleting someone else's posts without permission is a breach of trust and could be seen as disrespectful, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have thought she was showing support by sharing, even if it went against the author's wishes. There's also the aspect of the author using their mom's password to delete the posts, which is a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was to protect their privacy, the method used might not be justified.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The conflict is between respecting someone's wishes and the means taken to do so. The author had a valid reason for not wanting the information shared, but the way they addressed it (deleting posts they weren't the author of) could be seen as crossing a line. However, considering the mental health aspect and the violation of their explicit request, some might argue it's understandable.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the act of deleting the posts without consent is a breach of privacy and trust. The mom might have made a mistake, but the author's response could be seen as equally problematic. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the unauthorized deletion of someone else's content. But others might see it as a necessary action to protect their mental health. It's a bit of a gray area, but legally and ethically, the author did something they shouldn't have done. However, given the circumstances, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mom breached the agreement. Hmm, tricky. I think the key is that the author's action was a violation of the mom's Facebook account, which is a privacy issue regardless of intent. So A might be the correct answer.\n"
