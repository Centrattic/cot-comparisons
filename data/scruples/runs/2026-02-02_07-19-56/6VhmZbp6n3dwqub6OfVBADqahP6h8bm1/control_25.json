Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The situation involves the author being in recovery from mental illnesses, including anorexia. They were explicit about not wanting their mom to share their treatment publicly. The mom did post about it anyway, and the author deleted those posts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had clearly told their mom not to share this information beyond close family. The mom didn't respect that, posting on Facebook with a lot of friends. The author deleted the posts, which is a privacy violation since they used the mom's password. \n\nSo, the author is in a vulnerable position with their mental health. The mom's actions could have caused embarrassment or distress. The author's actions, while violating privacy, were done to protect themselves. But the act of deleting without consent is still a breach of trust, even if the motive is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom agreed to keep it private but didn't, which was the initial breach. The author's response was to delete the posts, which might be seen as a way to reclaim their privacy in a situation where they felt violated. However, the method\u2014deleting without asking\u2014is problematic. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, accessing someone else's account without permission is wrong. But emotionally, the author is dealing with mental health issues and felt wronged. The answer needs to weigh these factors. \n\nThe community might side with the author because the mom broke the agreement, but the act of hacking the account is still a privacy violation. So the author might be in the wrong for the method, even if the motive is sympathetic. However, some might argue that the mom's actions were worse, and the author was protecting their privacy. \n\nI think the answer hinges on consent. The author didn't have consent to access the mom's account, so that's a violation. But the context is important. The author had a good reason, but the means were wrong. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they broke the trust by accessing the account. However, others might argue that the mom's initial breach justifies the action. But legally, using someone's password without permission is a no-go. So probably answer A.\n"
