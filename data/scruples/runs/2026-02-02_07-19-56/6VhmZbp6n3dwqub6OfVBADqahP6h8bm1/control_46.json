Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts about their mental health treatment. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of anorexia and was in a residential treatment program. They explicitly told their mom not to share this information beyond close family. The mom, however, posted about it on Facebook with a large audience, which included people the author doesn't know. The author then used their mom's login (since she uses the same password) to delete the posts without her knowing.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author's privacy and autonomy are important, especially given their mental health recovery. Sharing such personal information without consent can be harmful and potentially trigger distress. The mom might have had good intentions, thinking she was offering support through prayer, but the author doesn't want pity or people defining them by their illness. That's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel hurt that her posts were deleted without her knowledge. She might believe she was acting in her child's best interest by sharing for support. However, the author's explicit request was ignored, which is a key point here. The breach of trust is significant because the mom agreed not to share the information beyond close family but still did so.\n\nThe author's action of deleting the posts without telling the mom is a bit of a gray area. While the intent was to protect their privacy, the method involved unauthorized access to someone else's account. That could be seen as a violation of privacy on the author's part as well. However, given the context of the author's mental health and the violation of their explicit request, it's a situation where they felt compelled to act to protect themselves.\n\nSo, weighing the breach of trust by the mom against the unauthorized deletion by the author, I think the primary wrongdoing is the mom's for violating the explicit agreement. The author's action is a response to that violation. But the method they used (hacking into their mom's account) is ethically questionable. However, considering the author's mental health and the mom's failure to respect boundaries, the author might not be in the wrong. It's a complex situation where both parties have issues, but the core of the problem is the mom's breach of trust. The author's action, while not ideal, was a reaction to that breach. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's an ethical line there about using someone's account without permission. However, given the context, it's more about protecting one's mental health and privacy, which is a strong factor.\n"
