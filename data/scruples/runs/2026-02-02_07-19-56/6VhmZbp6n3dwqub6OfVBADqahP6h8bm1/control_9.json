Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts. The key points here are about consent, privacy, and respecting boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of mental illness and was in a residential program. They explicitly told their mom not to share their condition publicly beyond close family. The mom, however, posted on Facebook, which the author found violating their trust. The author then deleted those posts without the mom's knowledge.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author acted wrong. On one hand, the mom broke a promise, which is a breach of trust. The author might feel that their privacy was invaded, especially given their sensitivity to being defined by their illness and the pity aspect. Deleting the posts could be seen as the author taking control back to protect their own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author accessed their mom's account without permission. That's a clear violation of privacy. Even if the mom had done something wrong, the right approach would be to address it directly with her, not take matters into their own hands by deleting the posts. The mom's actions might have been inappropriate, but the author's method of response could be seen as equally problematic because of the lack of consent.\n\nSo, while the mom's actions were wrong, the author's actions also involved a breach of privacy. The answer might hinge on whether the ends justify the means. However, in terms of right vs. wrong, accessing someone else's account without permission is a clear violation, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for deleting the posts without the mom's knowledge, even if the mom had broken a promise.\n"
