Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I\u2019m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:\n    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)\n     This especially pissed me off because I\u2019m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I\u2019ve never met. All I could think about was random people I\u2019ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can\u2019t stand is people pitying me. \n     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn\u2019t noticed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong for deleting their mom's Facebook posts.\n\nThe situation is that the author has mental health issues, was in a residential hospital for an eating disorder, and told their mom to keep it private. The mom posted about it on Facebook, which upset the author because it went against their wishes. The author then deleted the posts using their mom's password.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries here. The author trusted their mom not to share their personal health information. The mom broke that trust by posting publicly, which could lead to unwanted attention and pity. The author felt violated and decided to delete the posts themselves. \n\nLegally, deleting someone's posts without permission might be a privacy issue, but the context is about breach of trust. The mom used the same password for everything, which the author knew. So technically, the author accessed their mom's account. But the core issue is the mom violating the author's privacy. \n\nThe author's actions were a response to protect their own privacy. While it's not the most ethical way to handle it (since they didn't communicate with their mom), the initial breach comes from the mom. The author might have done something wrong, but the mom's actions set the stage. \n\nHowever, the problem is that the author didn't address the issue directly. Instead of deleting the posts, they should have talked to their mom and set clearer boundaries. But the mom's behavior was the root problem. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intent was to protect their privacy, which is valid. But the method involved violating their mom's privacy, which is also wrong. It's a conflict of privacy boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did delete posts without permission, but the mom broke the trust first. The answer might depend on whether the focus is on the breach of trust or the method used. If the mom had respected the author's wishes, this wouldn't have happened. But the author's actions were a direct response to that violation. \n\nIn many discussions, people might say the mom was wrong to post without consent, and the author acted out of necessity. Others might say the author should have communicated directly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is about the action itself, then maybe they are partially in the wrong for not communicating. But if the main issue is the mom's breach, then the author might be justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were protecting their privacy after the mom violated their trust. However, the method could have been better. But the core issue is the mom's actions, so the author's response is understandable.\n"
