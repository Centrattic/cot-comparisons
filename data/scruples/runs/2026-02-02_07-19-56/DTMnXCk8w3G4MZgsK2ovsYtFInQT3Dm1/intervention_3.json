We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, let's call her Sarah, was married to Henry for a while because he needed it for his visa. They broke up, but she stayed married to help him get his papers. Then she starts dating Jake, and doesn't tell him about the marriage until after he did a background check and found out. Now Jake is upset that she didn't tell him upfront and accuses her of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The marriage was for a specific reason, to help Henry stay in the country. She kept it a secret to fulfill a promise to his family. When she starts dating Jake, she doesn't mention it immediately because she thinks it's better to tell him in person. But Jake feels betrayed because he found out through a background check, which he probably did for his own reasons, maybe to check her background before meeting.\n\nNow, the key points here: Was Sarah lying? Well, she wasn't hiding the marriage from the start of the relationship. She intended to tell him in person. But he did a background check and found out before she could explain. But the issue is that she didn't disclose it when they were dating online, which he might consider important. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Even if the context is that the marriage was for a legal reason and not a current relationship, not disclosing such a significant fact could be seen as a breach of trust. However, she had valid reasons for waiting, but maybe she should have been upfront earlier. \n\nJake might feel that any marriage, even past, is relevant when starting a new relationship. But Sarah didn't mention it because she thought in-person was better. However, she did plan to tell him before meeting, which he found out she had discussed with her friend. But he did a background check, which might have been his own overstep, but he's using that to accuse her of lying. \n\nSo, is Sarah in the wrong for not telling him earlier? It depends on perspective. If Jake did a background check, maybe he was proactive, but she might have considered it a personal matter not relevant until they met. However, withholding such a significant detail could be seen as dishonest, even if her intentions were good. \n\nOn the other hand, the marriage was for a specific legal purpose and she was helping a former partner. She might not have seen it as relevant early on. But when someone does a background check and finds it, it's a red flag for the person involved. \n\nI think the main question is whether not disclosing the marriage immediately is lying. Since she didn't lie directly, but didn't tell the truth until after he found out, perhaps she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have been more transparent from the start. However, the fact that she planned to tell him in person and had discussed it with her friend shows she intended to be honest. The problem arises from Jake's expectations and his own actions (background check) causing the issue. \n\nSo, maybe she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
