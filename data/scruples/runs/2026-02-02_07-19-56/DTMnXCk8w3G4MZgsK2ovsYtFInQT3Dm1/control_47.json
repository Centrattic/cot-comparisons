We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person, let's call her Person A, is married to Henry, whom she met when he was an intern. They got married to help him stay in the country. After breaking up, she meets Jake (Person B) online and starts dating. She didn't tell him about the marriage until he found out through a background check.\n\nSo, the key points here are: She was married, got divorced after keeping her promise to Henry's family. She started a new relationship and didn't disclose her marital status upfront. She planned to tell him in person, even discussed it with her friend. But Jake found out via a background check and now accuses her of lying.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, technically, if she was married when she started seeing Jake, that's bigamous, which is illegal in most places. But wait, she had already divorced Henry before starting the relationship with Jake? Wait, no. Wait, she broke up with Henry two years after marrying, then kept the marriage until he got his papers. Then a year after breaking up, she met Jake. Wait, but if she was still married when she started dating Jake, that's bigamy. But if she had already divorced Henry before starting the relationship with Jake, then it's okay.\n\nWait, the timeline is: married to Henry, broke up (but still married), then a year after the breakup, met Jake. But she didn't divorce Henry until after the breakup. Wait, the original question says she broke up with Henry two years after the marriage, but kept the marriage to help him get his papers. So she was legally married when she started dating Jake. That's bigamy. So technically, she was married when she started seeing Jake, which is illegal. Therefore, she was in the wrong in terms of legal status. However, her reasoning was that she intended to tell him in person. But legally, that's not an excuse. \n\nBut maybe the key here is whether she was still married when she started the relationship. If she was still legally married when she started seeing Jake, then yes, she's in the wrong because bigamy is illegal. However, if she had already divorced Henry before starting the relationship, then no. The story says she promised not to divorce until he got his papers. Let me check the timeline again. She broke up with Henry after two years of marriage, but stayed married until he got his papers. So after the breakup, she was still married. Then a year after the breakup, she met Jake. So when she started dating Jake, she was still married. Therefore, she was in a legal marriage when she started the new relationship. That's bigamy. So technically, she was in the wrong. However, her intention to tell him in person might be seen as a good faith effort, but legally, that doesn't matter. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong in terms of moral or social expectations, not legal. The question is asking if she's in the wrong in the context of the relationship. So from a moral standpoint, she didn't disclose her marital status upfront. She had a reason, but withholding that information when it's a major factor (especially if you're planning to get married) could be seen as a lie of omission. However, she had a valid reason (waiting to tell in person). But Jake found out through a background check, which implies she didn't disclose it. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether she was still married when the relationship started. If yes, then she's in the wrong. If she had already divorced, then no. The story says she kept the marriage until he got his papers. Let's see: \"I promised his family... that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word.\" So she divorced him only after he got his papers. Therefore, when she met Jake, she was still married. So she was in the wrong. Therefore, answer A. But maybe the answer is B because her intentions were good. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that she didn't lie; she just didn't disclose. But Jake did a background check and found out. So she didn't actively lie, but she omitted information. Depending on the context, that could be seen as a lie. If you're in a legal marriage and don't disclose that when you start seeing someone, it's a significant omission. So depending on the perspective, she might be in the wrong. But if she had no intention to deceive and planned to tell eventually, maybe not. \n\nBut legally, she was in bigamy. Morally, she might be seen as wrong for not disclosing upfront. So likely, the answer is A, she's in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
