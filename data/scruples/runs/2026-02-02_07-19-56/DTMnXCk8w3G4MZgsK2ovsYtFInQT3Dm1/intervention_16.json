We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend she was married. Let me go through the details again.\n\nSo, she married Henry to help him stay in the country, they broke up, and she promised his family she wouldn't divorce him until he got his papers. Then she started dating Jake online and didn't tell him about the marriage until they were going to meet. She planned to tell him in person but he did a background check and found out. Now he's upset and accuses her of lying because he accessed her password and invaded her privacy.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty and timing. When is it appropriate to disclose such information? She was married but divorced, so maybe she didn't see it as a lie. She intended to tell him in person, but he found out through a background check. She did mention it to her best friend and planned to tell him in person before their meeting. \n\nThe question is whether withholding that info for a couple of months in the relationship was wrong. In some contexts, marriage history might not be something people expect to know early on, especially in an online relationship where details are shared gradually. However, depending on the cultural norms or personal boundaries, some people might expect full disclosure from the start of a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about trust because he felt lied to. But she didn't lie; she omitted information. The difference between lying and omitting can be significant. She didn't actively deceive him but didn't volunteer the information immediately. \n\nThe invasion of privacy by accessing her password is definitely wrong on his part. That's a red flag. However, the question is about her being in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's a gray area. Some might say she should have been upfront earlier, while others might understand her wanting to share in person. But the fact that she was going to tell him in person and had even planned to discuss it with a friend suggests she wasn't hiding it intentionally. \n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she intended to be honest but chose a suitable time. However, others might argue that marriage is a significant detail that should be shared sooner, not withheld even if not a lie. But I think the context matters here. She wasn't hiding it; she just waited until they met in person. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
