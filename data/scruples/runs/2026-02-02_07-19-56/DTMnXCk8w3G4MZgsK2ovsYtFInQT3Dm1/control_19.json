We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did something wrong by not telling her boyfriend, Jake, that she was married before she met him. \n\nSo, the author was previously married to Henry. They married because Henry needed it to stay in the country for his internship. They divorced after a couple of years, but she kept her word to not divorce him until he got his papers. Then, she met Jake online and started a relationship. She didn't tell him about the previous marriage until she was going to visit him in person, but he found out through a background check before she could tell him in person.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author didn't hide the fact that she was married; she just waited to share that information in person. She had planned to tell him when they met, which seems reasonable, especially since the relationship was still new. However, Jake found out via a background check, which he took as a betrayal. \n\nThe problem arises with Jake's reaction and his invasion of privacy (using her password, etc.), implying he feels trust was broken. But was the author actually in the wrong? Well, she didn't lie. She just hadn't disclosed the information yet. In a new relationship, especially starting online, people often choose how and when to share personal information. The author made a judgment call to tell him in person, which is a common approach for sensitive topics. \n\nHowever, some might argue that not being upfront could be seen as deceptive. But since she intended to tell him and had even discussed it with her friend, it's more about timing than intent. The main issue seems to be Jake's response, not the author's decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She made a choice based on her comfort level and the context of the relationship. The real problem might be Jake's inability to trust her despite her explanation. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
