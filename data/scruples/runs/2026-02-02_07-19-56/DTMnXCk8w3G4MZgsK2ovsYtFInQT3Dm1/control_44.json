We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe scenario is about a woman who married her ex-boyfriend (Henry) to help him stay in the country, then later dated someone else (Jake) without mentioning the marriage initially. She planned to tell him in person but he found out through a background check. Now, Jake is accusing her of lying and invading her privacy. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She married Henry for a valid reason\u2014helping him with his visa. They stayed married for two years before breaking up amicably. After that, she met Jake and didn't disclose the marriage right away. She intended to tell him in person, which she communicated to her friend. However, Jake found out through a background check and now feels betrayed, even though she had a plan to tell him.\n\nLegal aspects: If she's still married when she starts dating Jake, that's bigamy, which is illegal. However, the situation here is that she's divorced from Henry. Wait, no\u2014the story says she kept her word not to divorce Henry until he got his papers. So she's still married? Wait, the user says she \"break up with him\" after two years but didn't divorce him. So she's still legally married to Henry when she starts dating Jake. That's a problem because bigamy is illegal in most places. So if she was still married when she started the relationship with Jake, then she is legally in the wrong. That's a key point.\n\nBut the user might not know the legal implications, so maybe the moral aspect is more about honesty. She didn't lie initially; she just didn't disclose something she intended to share in person. However, in many relationships, transparency is important. If she was still married when she started dating Jake, that's a significant omission. Even if her intention was to tell him in person, not disclosing it at all until he found out through a background check could be seen as deceptive.\n\nJake's reaction might be justified because he found out through a background check, which implies she didn't mention it when they were building trust. Even if her reasons were good, not mentioning a prior marriage could be a breach of trust. However, she had a reason (waiting to tell in person) and even discussed it with her friend. So there's a gray area here.\n\nAlso, the fact that she kept the marriage going for her ex's benefit might be seen as honorable, but if she was still married when starting a new relationship, that's a legal and ethical problem. So the answer might depend on whether she was still married when she began the relationship with Jake. The story says she broke up with Henry two years after marriage but didn't divorce him. So if the marriage was still valid, then she was technically married when she started dating Jake. That makes her action illegal and ethically questionable. However, if the marriage was annulled or dissolved, it's different. The story doesn't mention a divorce, so she's still legally married. Therefore, she's in the wrong for entering a new relationship while still married. But if the marriage was already dissolved, then she's not. The story is a bit ambiguous on that. Wait, the user says she broke up with Henry but kept her word not to divorce him until he got his papers. So she's still married. Therefore, she is in the wrong because she's committing bigamy, which is illegal and a breach of trust. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong morally, not just legally. Even if it's legal, withholding such a significant detail about a prior marriage could be seen as dishonest, especially if she was still married when starting the new relationship. So, the answer is A (yes, she's in the wrong) because she was married when she started the new relationship and didn't disclose it, leading to trust issues even with her intentions.\n"
