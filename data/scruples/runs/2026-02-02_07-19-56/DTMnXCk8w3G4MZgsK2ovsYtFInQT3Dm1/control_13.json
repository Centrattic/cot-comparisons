We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, that she was married to Henry. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author married Henry to help him stay in the country. They broke up two years later but stayed friends. After that, she started dating Jake online. She didn't mention the marriage initially because she didn't want to give too much info early on. She planned to tell him in person when she visited. Then Jake did a background check and found out. She explained that she was going to tell him in person. Now Jake is upset, accusing her of lying and invading her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she was wrong. The key points are: Did she have a duty to disclose her previous marriage earlier? Was her reasoning valid? \n\nShe didn't hide it; she planned to tell him in person. However, she was married at the time she started dating Jake. Legally, being married means you can't be legally married to someone else. But the marriage was in the past and ended two years before the relationship started. So technically, she's not currently married. But some people might see it as a significant omission, especially if they're in a new relationship.\n\nHowever, she had a valid reason for waiting. She was concerned about privacy and wanted to share it in person. She also had a promise to Henry's family to not divorce until he got his papers, which she kept. That shows she wasn't trying to deceive Jake. She even discussed telling him with her friend and had plans to do so when she visited. \n\nJake's reaction is problematic because he did a background check, which is a bit invasive. Then he accuses her of lying, even though she intended to tell him. His actions (using her password, invading privacy) are his own issues. The author's intention was to be honest when the time felt right, not to deceive. So while she could have been more upfront, especially if he asked directly, she isn't in the wrong for waiting until she felt comfortable. The main wrongdoer seems to be Jake in this scenario. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
