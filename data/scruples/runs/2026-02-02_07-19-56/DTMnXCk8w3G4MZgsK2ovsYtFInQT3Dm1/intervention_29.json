We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, that she was married to Henry before meeting him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author married Henry for practical reasons\u2014so he could stay in the country due to visa issues. She kept the marriage going even after they broke up to help him get his papers. Then she started dating Jake online and didn't disclose the previous marriage upfront. She planned to tell him in person but he found out via a background check. Now Jake is upset about the withheld information and has invaded her privacy as a result.\n\nThe key points here are honesty and timing. The author didn't lie; she just didn't disclose the marriage upfront. However, being married is a significant life detail, especially in a new relationship. When building trust, transparency is important. The author had a legitimate reason for the marriage, but the way she handled the disclosure could be seen as deceitful, even if her intentions were good.\n\nJake's reaction is about trust. He feels that not knowing about the previous marriage is a lie, which is a big deal. The author argues that she didn't want to share that information online early in the relationship and planned to tell him in person. But since he discovered it through a background check, he feels betrayed. The invasion of privacy (using her password) is a separate issue, but the root of the conflict is the withheld information.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Even if the author had good intentions, not being upfront about being married could be seen as a breach of trust. The fact that she kept it from him until he found out on his own might make her responsible for the lack of disclosure. However, her reason for waiting was to protect their in-person meeting, which is understandable. \n\nBut in terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. She didn't actively lie, but she withheld important information. Depending on cultural norms and expectations, some might see this as a mistake. The author's actions led to mistrust, which Jake is now acting out against. So while she had her reasons, not being transparent about her marital history could be considered her fault. The answer would depend on whether the community sees withholding as lying or just poor judgment.\n"
