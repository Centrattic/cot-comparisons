We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who submitted the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the author, let's call her Jane, was married to Henry, got divorced, then started dating Jake. She didn't tell him about her past marriage until he did a background check and found out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. Jane married Henry to help him stay in the country, later divorced him, and promised his family not to divorce him until he got his papers. Then she met Jake online, didn't mention her past marriage initially, planned to tell him in person, but he found out through a background check. Now Jake is upset, saying she lied about being married, and invading her privacy.\n\nThe main question is whether Jane was wrong for not telling Jake about her previous marriage earlier. Let me break down the factors. \n\n1. **Reasons for not disclosing**: Jane didn't feel comfortable sharing such personal information early in the relationship, especially since they hadn't met in person yet. She planned to tell him in person after they met, which she discussed with her best friend. The promise to Henry's family also played a role\u2014she wanted to keep that commitment.\n\n2. **Timing of disclosure**: She waited until they agreed to meet and planned to tell him in person. However, Jake found out through a background check before that meeting. The question is whether withholding this information until the in-person meeting was wrong.\n\n3. **Jake's reaction**: He felt betrayed and doesn't trust her, citing the lie about being married. But Jane didn't lie; she didn't disclose the information yet, which is different from actively lying. However, depending on cultural norms or expectations, some might see not disclosing as a form of deception if the information is significant.\n\n4. **Privacy invasion**: Jake's response of invading her privacy (getting her password) is problematic regardless, but the core issue is Jane's disclosure timing.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is generally valued in relationships. However, the context matters. Jane had good intentions\u2014she wanted to protect Henry's situation and felt the timing wasn't right. Not all information needs to be revealed at the beginning, especially if it's sensitive and not directly relevant to the relationship's foundation (like past marriage vs. current marital status). Since she was no longer married when she met Jake, the fact that she was previously married might not be as critical to disclose upfront unless Jake asked directly.\n\nHowever, some might argue that any history of marriage should be disclosed if planning to get married again, to avoid future complications. But the problem here is that Jane didn't lie; she just didn't share the information yet. The key point is whether withholding this information until the in-person meeting was reasonable. Given that they hadn't met and she had a valid reason (promising Henry's family), it's more of a judgment call. \n\nIn many cases, people expect transparency in relationships, but the expectation can vary. If Jake expected full disclosure from the start, he might feel wronged. However, Jane's actions weren't deceitful; she intended to tell him once they met. The fact that Jake did a background check complicates things because he had the means to find out before their meeting, which might reflect his own lack of trust or the nature of their communication.\n\nConsidering all this, Jane's intentions were honest, and her decision to wait until they met in person was reasonable. The real issue might be Jake's reaction and his invasion of privacy, not the initial non-disclosure. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
