We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend Jake that she was married before.\n\nSo, the situation is that she married Henry to help him stay in the country, then broke up. Later, she starts dating Jake online and doesn't mention the marriage until they plan to meet in person. She buys a ticket and tells her friend about it, but Jake does a background check and finds out. She tells him over the phone, explaining her reasoning. Now Jake is upset, calling her a liar, and invading her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong not to disclose her marriage earlier. The key points here are honesty, context, and intent. The author didn't lie; she just didn't disclose the information immediately. She had a reason for waiting\u2014she wanted to tell him in person. She even discussed it with her friend, indicating she was planning to be honest. However, Jake expected more transparency from the start, especially since they were in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. While the author had a valid reason for waiting, withholding such significant information for a couple of months could be seen as a breach of trust. Jake might feel that the delay caused issues later, especially since he found out through a background check instead of being told directly. Even if her intention was good, the effect was that she didn't share important personal history when he might have wanted to know it earlier. \n\nPrivacy invasion by Jake is his issue, but the author's action of not being upfront could contribute to his lack of trust. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether the timing of disclosure was reasonable. Since they were in a relationship, there's an expectation of honesty, and major life events like a past marriage are usually relevant. So, while her intention wasn't to deceive, the timing might be seen as an omission. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that she didn't have to share everything immediately, especially in an online relationship. However, when a relationship progresses, especially with plans to meet in person, important details about one's past become more relevant. The fact that she waited until after planning the visit might be seen as not being completely upfront. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being at least partially at fault, but not entirely. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. The key is intent versus the impact. Since she didn't lie but withheld information, it's a gray area. But in terms of ethical standards, transparency is usually valued. Therefore, the answer could be that she's not in the wrong (B), but some might argue A. However, given the context, B is more likely correct.\n"
