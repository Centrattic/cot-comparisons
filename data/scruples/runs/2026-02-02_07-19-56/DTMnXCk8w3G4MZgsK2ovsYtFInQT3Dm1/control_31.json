We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they married Henry to help him stay in the country, then broke up but stayed married to help him get his papers. Then they started dating Jake online, didn't tell him about the marriage upfront, planned to tell him in person, but Jake found out via a background check and now is upset, saying they lied. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the author is still married when they start dating Jake, that's bigamy, which is illegal in most places. Even if the marriage was for a practical reason, it's still a legal marriage unless it's annulled or divorced. So technically, if the author was still married when they started the relationship with Jake, they could be legally in the wrong. But wait, they mentioned that they broke up two years after the marriage but kept it to help Henry. So the author is still married to Henry when they start dating Jake. That makes it illegal, right? Unless they obtained a divorce but didn't get the papers. If the divorce was finalized, then it's okay. But the author says they didn't divorce until Henry got his papers. So if the marriage is still valid, then the author is legally married to Henry when they start dating Jake. That would make the relationship with Jake a legal issue. But maybe the law isn't the only factor here. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author didn't disclose the marriage to Jake early on. They had a reason\u2014planning to tell in person\u2014but Jake found out through a background check. The author's reasoning is that they didn't feel comfortable sharing such a personal detail early in an online relationship. However, being married is a significant detail, especially if it affects the legality and the foundation of the relationship. Even if the author had good intentions, withholding such information could be seen as deceptive. But the author's intention wasn't to lie, just to time the disclosure appropriately. \n\nJake's reaction might be partly his issue, especially if he did a background check without consent, which might be a privacy violation. But his response to the author's deception (if it is one) is another layer. The author is being blamed for not being honest, but they had a plan to be honest. However, if the author was indeed in a legal marriage at the time, then technically, they were engaged in a bigamous relationship with Jake, which is a lie. So even if the author intended to tell the truth later, the act of starting the relationship while married could be considered lying by omission. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's situation is complicated. They had a reason to stay married for legal purposes. The question is whether they should have been upfront from the start. In a new relationship, especially one that could lead to marriage, being honest about past marriages is important. However, the author's marriage to Henry was still ongoing, so they weren't divorced. If the author was still married, then they were indeed in a bigamous relationship with Jake. So regardless of their intentions, they were legally and ethically in the wrong by entering a relationship while married. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they were in a legal marriage when starting the new relationship, making their actions deceptive or illegal. But if the marriage to Henry was already dissolved, then it's a different story. The key point is whether the marriage to Henry was still valid when the author started dating Jake. The author says they didn't divorce until Henry got his papers, so the marriage was still active. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
