We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the original author (AITA) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her previous marriage before meeting him. \n\nFirst, the situation: She married Henry to help him get his papers, they broke up amicably, and she kept the marriage going to fulfill her promise to his family. Now, she's dating Jake, and she didn't disclose the marriage initially because she didn't want to give out personal info early in the relationship. She planned to tell him in person but he found out through a background check.\n\nThe main issue is whether she was wrong to withhold this information. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, not disclosing a marriage license could be seen as deceptive, even if her intentions were good. Marital status can affect a relationship, so transparency is important. On the other hand, she had valid reasons: she was trying to protect her privacy and planned to tell him in person. Also, the marriage was already dissolved, so maybe the lie isn't about being currently married but past. \n\nBut legally, if she was married at the time they started dating, she wasn't lying about her current marital status. However, if she was still married when they started dating and didn't disclose it, that's a problem. Wait, the timeline says she broke up with Henry two years after marriage, and met Jake a year after the breakup. So if the marriage was already annulled or dissolved before meeting Jake, she wasn't married when she started dating him. But maybe the marriage license was still valid if the divorce was pending? The details are a bit unclear. \n\nWait, the user says she kept the marriage going to help Henry get his papers. So maybe the marriage wasn't legally dissolved yet. If the marriage was still active when she started dating Jake, then she was technically married during their relationship. That's a big issue. If the marriage ended before the relationship started, then she wasn't lying. But the problem arises if the marriage was still active when she started dating Jake. The key is when the divorce was finalized. \n\nAssuming the marriage ended before she started dating Jake, then not disclosing the past marriage might be a privacy choice. However, if she was still married when she met Jake, then she was being deceptive. The user says she broke up with Henry a year before meeting Jake. If the breakup was amicable and the marriage ended legally, then she's not in the wrong. But if she was still legally married when she started dating Jake, that's a problem. \n\nThe story mentions she promised to stay married until Henry got his papers. If she kept that promise, the marriage ended after Henry got his papers. If she met Jake after the marriage ended, then she wasn't married. However, the user says she broke up with Henry a year before meeting Jake. So if the breakup was the end of the marriage, and the legal divorce was finalized, then she's not in the wrong. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. Even if the marriage was legally over, the fact that she had a previous marriage might be relevant. However, Jake's reaction is about privacy invasion and not trusting her because of the initial withholding. The problem is that she didn't disclose the marriage license, which he found out via a background check. If the marriage was already over, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the marriage was still active, she is. \n\nGiven the details provided, the user states that she and Henry broke up a year before meeting Jake. So the marriage was over by then. Therefore, she wasn't married when she started dating Jake. So technically, she wasn't lying. But she didn't disclose a past marriage. Depending on cultural or personal expectations, some might argue that it's important to disclose past marriages. However, in many cases, people do have and disclose past marriages, but if it's not a current issue, it's not always necessary upfront. \n\nSo, in this case, if the marriage was legally dissolved before the relationship, she's not in the wrong. The issue is more about privacy and timing. Jake's reaction about invasion of privacy and mistrust stems from the fact that he found out through a background check, which might be a red flag for trust issues. However, the original author's intention to tell him in person, and her explanation, might absolve her. \n\nBut the problem is that she didn't tell him at all until he found out. Even if the marriage was over, withholding that information until forced could be seen as dishonest. So some might say she's in the wrong for not being upfront. Others might say it's her right to privacy. \n\nGiven that the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion, I need to weigh the legal and ethical aspects. If the marriage was over, then ethically, it's a judgment call. But if the marriage was still active, then definitely AITA. Since the timeline indicates the marriage ended before Jake entered the picture, the author isn't in the wrong for not disclosing a past marriage, especially if it didn't affect their current relationship. However, Jake might have a valid concern if he expected full transparency from the start. \n\nBut the user's friend and the author's best friend advised her on how to tell him, which shows she was planning to be honest. The fact that she was upfront once he found out also matters. So in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
