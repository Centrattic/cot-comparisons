We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she married Henry for immigration reasons, stayed married after they broke up because of a promise to his family, and then started dating Jake. She didn't tell him about being married early on, intending to bring it up in person when they met. But when he found out through a background check, he's been upset, saying she lied.\n\nFirst, I need to think about whether keeping such a major secret like being married is considered lying. If she was in an ongoing relationship with Jake, not telling him she was married could be seen as a serious issue. Marriage is a significant commitment, so not disclosing it could affect his perception of her and the relationship. But there's context here: the marriage was for a specific reason, and she had a good intention to tell him in person. She even discussed it with a friend, showing she planned to be honest eventually.\n\nHowever, when someone is in a new relationship, there's an expectation of honesty and transparency, especially on major life details. Even if she had her reasons, withholding such information might be seen as deceptive. The fact that he did a background check and found out makes it a point of contention because he felt the information was important enough to investigate. His trust is broken because he believes he wasn't told upfront.\n\nOn the other hand, she might argue that she intended to tell him in person, which is a respectful approach, but the timing was before they met in person. If they were in the early stages of the relationship and not even meeting yet, maybe she thought it was too soon. But marriage is such a big part of someone's identity that waiting until an in-person meeting might still be too late for someone who values honesty from the start.\n\nAlso, considering that she was married when the relationship started, that's a red flag for any new partner. Even if it's not her fault, the act of not disclosing it could be seen as a breach of trust. So from Jake's perspective, he might feel she lied by omission, which is still a lie. The author's intention doesn't negate the fact that she didn't share a crucial part of her life with him.\n\nBut some might argue that the circumstances of the marriage (for immigration purposes and a promise to family) are extenuating factors. However, the relationship with Jake is separate, and his right to know is important. Even if the marriage wasn't her fault, keeping it secret could be seen as wrong because it affects the foundation of trust in a relationship.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: she had good intentions and planned to tell him, but the act of not disclosing such a significant detail early on in the relationship could be considered a mistake. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because honesty is a key component in relationships, and withholding this information, regardless of intent, can damage trust.\n"
