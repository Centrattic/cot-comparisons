We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend she was married. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, she married Henry to help him stay in the country. They broke up two years later but stayed friends. She promised his family not to divorce him until he got his papers, which she kept. Then she met Jake online and dated him for a few months before planning to tell him in person. But Jake did a background check and found out first. She explained she was going to tell him in person and had discussed it with her friend. Now Jake is accusing her of lying and invading her privacy.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, she was married, but they're divorced now. Technically, she's not married anymore. The main issue is when she chose to disclose this. She didn't lie; she just delayed telling him. However, in a new relationship, important details like a past marriage might need to be disclosed sooner, especially if the relationship is moving towards a serious commitment. But she had a valid reason for wanting to tell him in person, and she did eventually explain. It seems like she was being honest once found out. On the other hand, Jake's reaction is harsh, maybe overreacting. The key points are intention and honesty. She didn't intentionally hide it; she planned to tell him, just not immediately. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
