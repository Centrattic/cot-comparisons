We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a marriage that was kept secret from the current boyfriend, and then the current boyfriend found out through a background check.\n\nFirst, the author married someone else (Henry) to help him stay in the country. They later broke up but remained friends. Then, she started dating Jake online and didn't mention her past marriage until after a background check revealed it. She intended to tell him in person but didn't before the check.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the key points here are honesty and deception. By not telling Jake upfront, she withheld important information. Even if she had a reason (like planning to tell in person), keeping a past marriage a secret, especially when it's discoverable via a background check, could be seen as a lie by omission. Jake might feel that she was being dishonest by not sharing that detail earlier, especially since he discovered it through a background check, which he might have done for a valid reason, like checking her background before moving forward in the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author had a history of keeping this marriage secret to honor a promise to Henry's family. She might have thought it was better to tell in person. But Jake's reaction about invading her privacy and using it against her suggests that he feels the deception affected their trust.\n\nOn the other hand, if she had a legitimate plan to disclose it in person, maybe she wasn't intentionally lying. But the fact that she didn't mention it even after a few months and only after he found out through a check might make Jake feel betrayed. The invasion of privacy by Jake is a red flag too, but the core issue is the author's honesty.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is crucial. Even if the reason for withholding is understandable, the act of not being upfront can be seen as deceptive. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being honest from the start. However, if Jake's actions (like using her password) are inappropriate, that's his fault too. But the question is solely about her.\n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because she withheld a significant part of her past that could impact their relationship. Even if she had good intentions, withholding that information after a certain point could be considered dishonest.\n"
