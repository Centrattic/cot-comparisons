We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, that she was previously married to Henry.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: She married Henry to help him stay in the country. They broke up two years later but stayed friends. She promised his family she wouldn't divorce him until he got his papers, which she kept. Then she met Jake online, dated for a few months, and planned to tell him in person during a visit. But Jake did a background check and found the marriage license before she could tell him. She explained her reasoning, but he still doesn't trust her and accuses her of lying.\n\nSo, was she wrong? Well, legally, she was married but divorced after the breakup. The story doesn't mention her getting a divorce from Henry after they separated. Wait, that's a big point. If she was still legally married when she started dating Jake, then she was having a relationship while married, which is adultery in some places. But if she had divorced Henry, then she's single. The story says she broke up two years after marriage, and she promised not to divorce until he got his papers. If the papers came through after the breakup, maybe she was still legally married when she met Jake. If she wasn't divorced, then her not disclosing her marital status could be considered deceptive because she was still married. However, if she had divorced Henry, then she's legally single, and not telling Jake about her past marriage isn't a lie. \n\nThe story says she broke up with Henry two years after marriage and that they were still good friends. But she didn't divorce him until after his papers were resolved. So it's possible she was still legally married when she started dating Jake. If that's the case, then she was married during the relationship, which could be a problem. However, the story doesn't explicitly say when the divorce happened. If she was divorced before meeting Jake, then she's not in the wrong for not mentioning a past marriage unless he asked. But if she was still married when she started dating Jake, then she's in the wrong because she was having a relationship while legally married to someone else. \n\nThe user's question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling Jake about being married. If she was still married when they started dating, then not disclosing that is a lie. If she was divorced, then she's not lying about her current marital status, just not mentioning her past marriage. In that case, depending on cultural norms, some might say it's better to be honest from the start, but she planned to tell him in person. However, Jake did a background check and found the marriage license. If the marriage was still active, then she's in the wrong. If it was already dissolved, then she's not. The story is a bit unclear on the divorce timeline. \n\nAssuming that she was still married when she started dating Jake, then she's in the wrong. However, if she was divorced, then she's not. The story mentions she promised not to divorce until his papers were sorted, so maybe the divorce happened after his papers were approved. If that was a year after the breakup, and she met Jake a year after the breakup, then maybe she was divorced by then. So when she met Jake, she was already divorced. Therefore, she was single when she started dating him. In that case, not telling him about her past marriage isn't a lie, but she should have been honest when he found out. However, Jake's actions (invading privacy, using her password) are also problematic. \n\nBut the main question is whether she's in the wrong. If she was divorced when she met Jake, then she's not in the wrong for not disclosing past marriage unless he asked. She intended to tell him in person. So answer B. If she was still married, answer A. Since the story says she broke up with Henry two years after marriage, then a year later met Jake. If the divorce happened after the breakup and before meeting Jake, then she's not in the wrong. The problem is that the story doesn't specify when the divorce occurred. But since she promised not to divorce until his papers were sorted, and that took a year after the breakup, it's possible she divorced him after his papers were done, which would be after the breakup. Therefore, when she met Jake, she was divorced. Hence, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
