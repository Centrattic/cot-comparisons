We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, the author married Henry to help him get his papers and later broke up. Then she started dating Jake. She didn't tell him about the marriage immediately, planning to tell him in person after they met. But Jake did a background check and found out. The author argues she didn't want to share personal info early on and planned to tell him in person. Jake feels she lied because she didn't disclose it sooner, leading to trust issues now.\n\nHmm. Legally, she's still married, right? So if she's in a new relationship and not disclosing her marital status, that's a problem. Because even if she intended to tell him in person, she's still in a legal marriage. From the perspective of the new relationship, not being upfront about being married could be seen as dishonest, especially if she's now in a committed relationship. The fact that she had a past reason for the marriage doesn't matter here because her current partner isn't part of that history. She should have been honest from the start. So, even if her intentions were good, withholding such a significant detail could be considered lying by omission. Jake's trust is fair to be broken, I think. The author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
