We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she married someone (Henry) for immigration purposes when they were in a relationship. They broke up after two years, stayed friends, and she didn't divorce him to help him get his papers. Then she starts dating someone new, Jake, online. She didn't tell him about the marriage upfront, planning to do so in person. But Jake did a background check and found out. Now he's upset, saying she lied, and he's invading her privacy because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she was wrong to not disclose her marriage earlier. She mentioned that she didn't want to share too much early in the relationship, especially with someone she hadn't met in person. She had a good reason for marrying Henry, which was to get his immigration papers, and she kept her promise to his family by not divorcing him until he got them. So the marriage wasn't just a lie; it had a real purpose. \n\nWhen dating Jake, she intended to tell him in person because she felt it's more appropriate, especially for a sensitive topic. She even talked to her best friend about how to tell him. However, Jake took it as a lie because she didn't mention it earlier. But from her perspective, she wasn't hiding it; she planned to disclose it when they met. The timing of when she told him was when Jake found out through a background check, which might not be something she could control.\n\nNow, was she wrong? Well, honesty is important in relationships, but the context matters. She had a valid reason for the marriage, and she wasn't trying to deceive Jake. She just wanted to disclose it in a more personal way. However, in some relationships, people expect full transparency upfront, especially if they're planning to meet in person. But since they were in the early stages online, maybe her approach was reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, Jake's invasion of privacy (getting her password) is problematic regardless. That's a red flag. But the question is about whether she was wrong for not telling him about the marriage. If she had a good reason and intended to tell him, and Jake's reaction is based on her not telling him immediately, then maybe she's not entirely at fault. \n\nBut maybe there's an expectation that if you're planning to meet in person, you should disclose significant life events like a past marriage. However, since she had already broken up with Henry and they were friends, maybe it's not as big of an issue. \n\nSo considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She had legitimate reasons for the marriage, intended to tell Jake in person, and the issue here might be more about Jake's trust issues and his own actions (privacy invasion) rather than her not disclosing upfront. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
