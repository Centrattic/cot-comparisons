We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author married Henry for practical reasons, mainly to help him get his papers. They stayed married even after breaking up as friends, as she promised his family. Later, she starts dating Jake online. She didn't tell him about the marriage right away, planning to tell him in person before their meeting. However, Jake did a background check and found out. The author explains her reasoning, but Jake still feels betrayed and invades her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, bigamy is illegal, but since the author is married to Henry and then dates Jake, if she's still legally married, she can't legally marry Jake. But she's not trying to marry Jake, just date. Legally, maybe not an issue, unless the marriage isn't dissolved yet. Wait, the story says she didn't divorce Henry until he got his papers, which he eventually did. But the timeline isn't clear. If she's still married when she starts dating Jake, that could be a problem. Wait, the original story says she married Henry to help him get his papers. Then she broke up with him two years later but stayed married until he got his papers. The breakup was a year before meeting Jake. So if she's already divorced by the time she starts dating Jake, then there's no legal issue. But the story says she kept her word to not divorce until he got his papers. So when she meets Jake, she's still married. That's important. If she's still married when dating Jake, that's adultery in some places, but morally, it's a different question.\n\nNow, the main issue is not telling Jake about the marriage. The author argues she planned to tell him in person and had discussed it with her friend. But Jake did a background check and found out. The author didn't lie; she didn't disclose, but didn't actively lie either. However, when asked, she didn't come clean. Depending on cultural norms, some might say honesty is key in a relationship from the start. If Jake felt the need for transparency, not disclosing could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intention was to tell later. On the other hand, if the author had a good reason to wait and planned to tell him, maybe she's not in the wrong. But Jake's reaction is about trust. He says he can't trust her because of the \"lie.\" The author says she didn't lie, just withheld information until she could explain in person. \n\nThe key here is whether withholding information is considered a lie. If she didn't tell him, but also didn't correct him if he asked, that's different. But in this case, she didn't proactively lie. However, once he found out through a background check, she did explain her reasoning. The problem is that he continues to use it against her, even after understanding her reasons. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. Legally, if she's still married, but morally, withholding such a significant detail from a partner could be seen as a failure to be upfront. However, her intention was to tell him in person. Some might argue that honesty is essential from the start, especially when moving into a serious relationship. Others might see her reasoning as valid, especially if she planned to disclose it. \n\nBut Jake's invasion of privacy by doing a background check and accessing her password is problematic. That's a breach of trust regardless. The author's withholding might have contributed to Jake's insecurity, leading to his actions. However, the author's main action was not telling him, not lying. So is she in the wrong? \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. If the marriage is already dissolved, then her not telling Jake isn't a big issue. But if she's still married when dating him, even if not planning to marry him, that's a different matter. The story says she divorced Henry after he got his papers, which was a year after the breakup. So when she met Jake, she was still married. That's important. If she's still married, then even if she's not trying to marry Jake, the fact that she's in a relationship while married could be seen as a problem. However, the story doesn't say she's trying to marry Jake. \n\nIn terms of the AITA question, the focus is on not telling Jake about the marriage. If she knew he was going to do a background check, maybe she should have told him earlier. But she had a plan to tell him in person. Since she didn't lie, but withheld information, it's debatable. Some would say that in a relationship, honesty is key, and not disclosing such a major life event is a failure to communicate. Others might see her reasoning as valid, especially given the circumstances of the marriage. \n\nGiven that the author has a valid reason (helping Henry with his papers) and planned to disclose it, but didn't lie, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, the fact that she was still married when dating Jake could be a factor. But since the marriage was for a practical reason and she intended to divorce once Henry got his papers, maybe that's excusable. \n\nJake's actions (invading privacy, using the password) are definitely wrong, but the question is about the author. Considering all this, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for not telling immediately if she planned to disclose it and had valid reasons.\n"
