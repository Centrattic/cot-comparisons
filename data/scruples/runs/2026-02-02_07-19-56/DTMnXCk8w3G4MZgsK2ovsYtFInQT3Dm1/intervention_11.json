We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the key facts: The author married Henry to help him stay in the country, then broke up but stayed married to honor her promise to his family. Later, she starts a new relationship with Jake. She didn't tell him about the marriage initially, planning to do so in person. However, Jake found out through a background check and now accuses her of lying.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: Being married is a legal fact. If you're in a new relationship, you're expected to disclose major life facts, including your marital status. Marriage status is relevant because it affects the legality of a new relationship. If the author was still married, entering a new relationship could be considered bigamous, which is illegal in many places. However, in this case, she had already divorced Henry. Wait, the scenario says she married Henry but after breaking up, she stayed married to help him get his papers. So she's still legally married when she starts the new relationship with Jake. That's a key point.\n\nIf she was still married when she started dating Jake, then technically, she was in a legally invalid relationship if she married again. But the question is about whether she was in the wrong for not telling him upfront. Even if she had a good reason (planning to tell in person), withholding such a significant detail could be seen as deceptive. Especially since Jake found out through a background check, which implies he might have done this to verify her background, possibly leading to trust issues.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that she didn't want to share personal info early in the relationship, especially online. But marriage status is a fundamental aspect of one's identity and legal status. Not disclosing it could lead to misunderstandings or legal complications. Jake's reaction about trust is valid because trust is a cornerstone of relationships. Even if the intention was good, omitting such a significant fact can be seen as a breach of honesty.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a genuine reason for waiting to tell him in person. She even discussed it with her friend and planned to inform him during their meeting. However, in the context of a new relationship, some might argue that transparency is necessary from the start. The fact that she was already married when starting the relationship might make her actions culpable, regardless of her intentions.\n\nLegally, if she was still married, she couldn't legally marry Jake, but the scenario doesn't mention them getting married. It's about a dating relationship. The main issue is honesty in the relationship. So while her intention was to tell him, the act of not disclosing a current marriage (even if for a good reason) could be seen as deceptive.\n\nTherefore, considering the need for transparency in a relationship, especially regarding legal status, the author may be in the wrong for not disclosing her marital status earlier, even if she had planned to tell him later. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
