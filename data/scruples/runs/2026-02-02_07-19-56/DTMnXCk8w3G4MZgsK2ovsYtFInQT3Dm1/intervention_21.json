We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The situation involves them not telling their boyfriend Jake that they were previously married to Henry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author married Henry for practical reasons to help him stay in the country. They stayed married even after breaking up because they promised his family to not divorce him until he got his papers. Then, when dating Jake, they didn't mention the marriage initially, planning to tell him in person. However, Jake found out through a background check and is now upset, accusing the author of lying and invading their privacy.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they didn't want to share such personal information early in the relationship, especially with someone they hadn't met in person yet. But Jake feels betrayed and doesn't trust them anymore.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the arguments. On one hand, the author had a valid reason to marry Henry for a practical purpose, and keeping the marriage secret until they met in person was their way of handling it. They did inform Jake eventually, even before meeting, when he found out. They might argue that they were honest when they told him and that their intention was to share the information in a more personal setting.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of transparency in a relationship. When entering into a new relationship, especially one that's progressing to a meeting in person, there might be an expectation of full disclosure on important life events like past marriages. Not mentioning it could be seen as withholding information, which might affect trust. Even if the reason was to share it in person, the fact that Jake discovered it through a background check might make him feel that the author didn't come clean when they should have.\n\nAlso, the author's justification about meeting in person first might not hold up in Jake's eyes. If the relationship was becoming serious enough to plan a visit, he might expect to know about the author's past marriage before making that commitment. The author's decision to not share this could be seen as keeping secrets, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nPrivacy invasion by Jake is mentioned, but that's a separate issue. The focus here is on the author's actions regarding the marriage. The key is whether withholding the marriage information was a reasonable action or a breach of trust.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people might have different views. Some might empathize with the author's intention to share it in person, while others might think that such important information should be disclosed earlier, especially if the relationship is moving forward. The author's history with Henry complicates things, but the main issue is the honesty in the current relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision not to disclose the marriage early on might be seen as a mistake, even if their intention was to share it in person. The fact that Jake found out through a background check, which the author didn't control, complicates things, but the initial withholding might still be considered as the author being in the wrong for not being upfront. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
