We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she was married to Henry for a while, then broke up but stayed friends. She promised his family she wouldn't divorce him until he got his papers, so she kept the marriage going even after the breakup. Then she met Jake online, dated for a couple of months, and planned to tell him in person when she visited. But Jake did a background check and found the marriage license before she could tell him. She says she planned to tell him in person and had discussed it with her best friend. Now Jake is upset because he feels she lied by not telling him upfront.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If she was still legally married when she started dating Jake, that's bigamy, which is illegal in many places. But she mentioned that she broke up with Henry and stayed friends, but she kept the marriage until he got his papers. So if she's still married when she starts dating Jake, then technically she's in a bigamous relationship, which is illegal. However, the scenario says she broke up with Henry two years after the marriage, but she didn't divorce him until a year later after meeting Jake. Wait, no, the timeline: she married Henry, then broke up two years later but didn't divorce until after a year of dating Jake. So when she started dating Jake, she was still legally married. That makes her relationship with Jake bigamous. But maybe she got a divorce first? Wait, the user says she promised not to divorce Henry until he got his papers. So she might still be married when she starts dating Jake. So, legally, that's a problem. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong morally or ethically, not necessarily legally. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, she didn't disclose her marriage to Jake when they started dating. She planned to tell him in person, but he found out through a background check. She argues that she wasn't comfortable sharing that information early in the relationship, especially online. However, not disclosing a current marriage when starting a new relationship could be seen as deceptive, even if she intended to tell him later. The key point here is whether she was still married when she started the relationship with Jake. If she was, then she is in a bigamous situation, which is legally and ethically problematic. However, if she had already divorced Henry before meeting Jake, then it's a different scenario. The user mentions that she broke up with Henry two years after the marriage and then a year later met Jake. If she didn't divorce Henry until after the breakup, then during her relationship with Jake, she was still married. Therefore, she was in a bigamous relationship, which would make her at fault. \n\nBut wait, the user says she broke up with Henry but kept the marriage until he got his papers. So she might have divorced him after a year of dating Jake. However, the user's timeline is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again. She married Henry, broke up after two years but stayed friends. Then, a year after the breakup, she met Jake. So during the time she was dating Jake, she was still married to Henry because she didn't divorce him until after he got his papers. Therefore, when she started dating Jake, she was still legally married. So she was in a relationship while still married, which is bigamy. That would make her in the wrong. However, the reason for the marriage was to help Henry get his papers, and she kept the marriage going even after the breakup. So she might have thought it was temporary, but when she started a new relationship, she was still legally married. \n\nFrom Jake's perspective, he felt lied to because she didn't disclose her marriage early on. She argues that she planned to tell him in person, but he found out through a background check. The question is whether not telling him immediately was a lie. If she was still married when they started dating, then not disclosing that is a lie by omission. Even if she intended to tell him later, withholding that information until he found out through a background check could be seen as dishonest. \n\nOn the other hand, she might have had good intentions, like wanting to protect Henry's immigration status and keeping her promise. But legally and ethically, entering a relationship while still married is problematic. So the answer might depend on whether she was still married when she started dating Jake. If she was, then she is in the wrong. If she had already divorced Henry before meeting Jake, then she's not. The user's timeline suggests she was still married when she started dating Jake, so the answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong). However, if she divorced Henry before meeting Jake, then B (No). The user's statement says she broke up with Henry two years after marriage and then a year later met Jake. She promised not to divorce until Henry got his papers. So it's possible she was still married when she met Jake. Therefore, she was in a bigamous relationship, which is illegal and ethically wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
