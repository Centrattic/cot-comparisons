We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend she was married before meeting him in person.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author married Henry when he needed to stay in her country. They broke up two years later, became friends, and she stayed married to help him get his papers. Then she met Jake online, dated for a couple of months, and planned to tell him in person when she visited. However, Jake did a background check and found out before she could tell him. The author didn't mention her previous marriage initially because she didn't want to give out personal info early in the relationship, especially online. \n\nNow, the conflict is Jake feeling betrayed because she didn't disclose her marital status upfront. He accessed her passwords and used it against her, citing the \"lie\" about being married. The author argues she intended to tell him in person and had discussed it with her best friend. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, legally, if she was already divorced from Henry when she started dating Jake, then she isn't legally married anymore. But the problem here is more about honesty and transparency in a relationship. When starting a new relationship, especially one that moves quickly to meeting in person, people usually expect to share important personal information like previous marriages. The author withheld this info even though she knew she was going to meet him in person, which she planned to do after some time. \n\nHowever, the reason she gave for not disclosing was that she didn't want to share personal details early on. That could be a valid concern because sharing too much too soon can be overwhelming. But when a significant detail like a previous marriage is discovered through a background check, it's understandable that the other person might feel misled, even if the intention was to be honest later. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the author was already divorced, then technically she wasn't married when she was dating Jake. The marriage was part of her past, so it's similar to having been married before. People often disclose past marriages when asked or when the relationship progresses, but it's not necessarily a lie if you don't mention it until later. However, if Jake expected complete transparency from the start, then the author's delay in disclosure could be seen as a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, Jake's actions\u2014doing a background check and invading her privacy\u2014seem more problematic. Using a background check to find out about her past marriage might indicate his own lack of trust or insecurity. His response of calling her a liar is harsh, especially since she had a plan to tell him in person. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's intention was to be honest when the time felt right, which is reasonable. However, the fact that she waited until a background check revealed it might have made Jake feel that she was hiding something. If the marriage was still relevant (like if she was still legally married), then it's a bigger issue. But since she had already divorced Henry before meeting Jake, it's more about past history. \n\nIn most cases, people are expected to share significant past relationships, including marriages, when asked or when the relationship is becoming serious. But the author didn't lie; she just didn't volunteer the information upfront. So, depending on cultural norms and expectations, she might not be in the wrong. However, if Jake felt that transparency was necessary from the beginning, then she might have a responsibility to disclose sooner. \n\nBut the key here is that she was no longer married when they started dating. So, the main issue is whether withholding a past marriage is a lie. In that case, I think it's not a lie if she was honest when she eventually told him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Jake's reactions are more about his own issues with trust and privacy invasion.\n"
