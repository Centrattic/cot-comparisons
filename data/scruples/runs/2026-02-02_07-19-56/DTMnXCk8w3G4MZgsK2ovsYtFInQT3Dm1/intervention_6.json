We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting married to her boyfriend Henry to help him stay in the country, then later marrying him again? Wait, no\u2014wait, the first marriage was Henry, and then after breaking up with him, she marries Jake? Or no, wait, she's married to Henry and then splits up, then starts dating Jake. So she's still married to Henry when she starts dating Jake. But she didn't tell Jake until she was going to meet him, but he found out through a background check.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether she was wrong for not disclosing her previous marriage to Jake before their relationship became serious. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me break it down. At the time she started dating Jake, she was already married to Henry. If she was married, then legally she can't be married again unless she's divorced. So if she married Henry and later broke up but didn't get divorced, she's still legally married. So when she started dating Jake, she was still married. That would mean that any subsequent marriage to Jake would be illegal, but the post doesn't mention her marrying Jake. Wait, the original question says she's married in the first part. Then she breaks up with Henry and remains married to him until he gets his papers. So she's still married to Henry when she starts dating Jake. Therefore, she's in a relationship with Jake while still married to someone else. Depending on the jurisdiction, this could be bigamy, which is illegal.\n\nHowever, the key point here is whether she was wrong in not disclosing her existing marriage to Jake. The question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the context of the relationship. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that she didn't want to share personal info early in the relationship, especially online. She planned to tell in person. But when Jake found out through a background check, he felt betrayed. The author argues that she had a valid reason (keeping the information private until meeting in person), but Jake is still holding it against her.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, ethically, when you're in a relationship, especially one that's progressing to a serious level, being honest about your legal status (marriage) is important. If you're married, you can't be in another romantic relationship legally. So starting a relationship while still married is problematic. But the author ended her marriage with Henry before starting a new relationship? Wait, no. Wait, she says after breaking up with Henry, she still married him to help him stay. Wait, no. Let me re-read the situation.\n\nOriginal situation: She married Henry to help him get his papers. Then two years later, they broke up but she stayed married to him until he got his papers. So she was married to Henry during the breakup and after. When she starts dating Jake, she's still legally married to Henry. Therefore, she's in a relationship while still married. That's bigamy, which is a legal issue. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong in the moral sense. \n\nEven if it's not legal, morally, entering a relationship while married is wrong. She didn't disclose her marital status to Jake. When Jake found out, he felt lied to. The author argued she planned to tell him in person, but didn't do so quickly enough. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, even if the intent was to tell eventually, withholding such significant information until meeting in person might be seen as dishonest. The fact that she was married when starting the relationship with Jake is a major issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she was in a relationship while married, and didn't disclose that fact to Jake early on. So answer A.\n"
