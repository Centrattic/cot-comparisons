We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she married her ex-boyfriend, Henry, to help him stay in the country, and after they broke up, she started dating Jake. She didn't tell him about the marriage until he found out through a background check. Now Jake is upset because he feels she lied by not telling him upfront.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She married Henry because it was necessary for his visa status, and she kept the marriage until he got his papers. That seems like a responsible thing she did, honoring her promise to his family. After the breakup, she started dating Jake and planned to tell him in person. She even discussed it with her best friend before buying the ticket. However, Jake did a background check and found out before she could tell him in person. \n\nThe key points here are her intentions and how she communicated. She didn't lie; she just withheld information until she felt it was the right time. She intended to be honest but chose the method of disclosure. Jake's issue is about trust because he feels she didn't come clean upfront. But withholding information isn't the same as lying, especially if the intention was to be honest eventually. \n\nHowever, maybe there's an expectation in relationships to be upfront about past marriages, especially if it could affect the current relationship. But she had a valid reason for not disclosing it immediately\u2014she didn't want to share personal details early in an online relationship. She planned to tell him in person, which shows she wanted to handle it carefully. \n\nJake's actions of invading her privacy and using the marriage issue against her are problematic. His behavior might be a reaction to his own insecurities or the way he handled the background check. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not disclosing immediately if she had good intentions and planned to be honest. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She made a judgment call to share the information in person, which was respectful, and Jake's reaction is more about his own trust issues than her being dishonest.\n"
