We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author married a guy for visa reasons, then later married someone else (Jake) and didn't tell him about the first marriage until after a background check found out. Now Jake is upset because she didn't disclose it earlier, leading to trust issues.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author married Henry to help him stay in the country. After breaking up, she married Jake, but didn't tell him about the previous marriage until he found out through a background check. She had planned to tell him in person. However, Jake feels she lied and can't trust her now. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, she was married to Henry, so she was married when she started the relationship with Jake. That's a red flag. Even if the marriage to Henry was for practical reasons, she was still legally married when she started dating Jake. Not disclosing that is a lie by omission. \n\nBut there's context: she had a good reason for the first marriage, and she intended to tell Jake in person. She discussed it with her best friend. However, in a relationship, especially when planning to meet in person, not disclosing a previous marriage is a big thing. Marital status is a personal matter, but if you're entering a new relationship, honesty is crucial. \n\nThe question is whether not telling him sooner was wrong. Legally, if she was married to Henry at the time of the relationship with Jake, then she was lying about her marital status. But maybe she was divorced? Wait, in the story, she says they were married for two years, then she broke up with him. But then she kept the marriage intact to help him get his papers. So she didn't divorce him. That means when she started dating Jake, she was still married to Henry. That's a problem. \n\nSo she was technically married when she started a relationship with Jake. That's a lie. Even if she planned to tell him later, the fact that she was married and didn't disclose it until after a background check is an issue. Jake has a right to know if his partner is married to someone else. \n\nSo, even if her intentions were good, she was in a legal marriage when she started the relationship. That's a significant omission. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
