We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author marrying a guy named Henry to help him stay in the country, then breaking up, and later dating Jake. She didn't tell Jake about the marriage until she was going to meet him in person, but he found out through a background check and is upset, thinking she lied.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author made a mistake. The key points here are the timing of the disclosure and the justification for not telling him earlier. The author married Henry for a practical reason (helping him with his visa) and later broke up amicably. When starting a new relationship with Jake, she didn't mention the marriage initially, planning to talk about it in person. However, Jake did a background check and found out before she could tell him.\n\nThe main issue is whether not disclosing the marriage early on in the relationship constitutes a lie. The author didn't actively lie; she just didn't share the information yet. She had a reason for waiting\u2014she didn't want to give out personal info over the internet and planned to discuss it in person. But Jake feels betrayed because he thinks she withheld important information, which he considers a lie. \n\nNow, considering the perspective of both parties. The author had valid reasons for waiting, and she did plan to be honest eventually. On the other hand, Jake might feel that significant life details like a previous marriage are important early on, especially if there's a legal aspect (divorce status). The fact that she kept the marriage secret for a period could lead to mistrust, especially if he needed to know for legal or personal reasons.\n\nBut was she in the wrong? Legally, if she was still married during the time she was dating Jake, that's bigamy, which is illegal in many places. Wait, the author broke up with Henry two years before meeting Jake, and then waited another year before meeting Jake. So the marriage was already over by the time she met Jake. The divorce was final, so she wasn't legally married when she started dating Jake. Therefore, she wasn't committing bigamy. \n\nHowever, the ethical question is about transparency. Even though she wasn't lying, withholding such a significant piece of information until she felt ready might be seen as not being fully honest from the start. But she had a plan to disclose it in person, which shows intent to be truthful. The problem arises because Jake discovered it through a background check, leading to feelings of betrayal. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial, but the timing and method of disclosure can be subjective. If the author had a legitimate reason for waiting and didn't intend to deceive, she might not be in the wrong. However, if Jake felt that the information was necessary to know much earlier, there's a conflict in expectations. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as not fully transparent, but not a deliberate lie. The fact that she was going to tell him in person suggests she wanted to handle it properly. Still, Jake's reaction is about trust, which is understandable. The key here is whether the author's justification for waiting is valid. Since she wasn't legally married, it's more about personal history rather than an ongoing legal issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because she wasn't lying and had plans to disclose the information. However, the situation is nuanced. The answer could depend on cultural or personal expectations about sharing past relationships. Since the marriage was already ended, her intent was to be honest, so she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
