We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her previous marriage before they met in person.\n\nFirst, the key facts: She married Henry to help him stay in the country, they broke up two years later and remained friends. Then she met Jake online, started dating, didn't mention the marriage initially because she didn't want to give out too much info early on. She planned to tell him in person when she visited. However, Jake did a background check, found the marriage license, and confronted her. She explained her reasoning, but he still accuses her of lying and invading her privacy.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was in the wrong. Legally, she wasn't married to Henry when she started dating Jake, so there's no legal issue. The main ethical question is about honesty and timing. She didn't hide the marriage; she planned to disclose it in person. However, she didn't tell him upfront when he started asking about her background. \n\nThe user's reasoning might hinge on intentions. She had a valid reason to wait until meeting in person, especially since she had discussed it with her friend. However, Jake did a background check, which suggests he might have expected transparency. But she wasn't hiding it\u2014she was waiting for the right time. On the other hand, if Jake felt the need to check her background, maybe he should have asked her directly instead of assuming she was lying. \n\nPrivacy invasion by Jake (using her password) complicates things. The author's actions might be seen as not entirely in the wrong since she intended to disclose, but some might argue that not being upfront about a major life event (marriage) is dishonest. However, the timing and context matter. She was planning to tell him, just not immediately. \n\nThe key here is whether withholding information until a planned time counts as lying. Since she didn't actively deceive but withheld info, some might say it's not a lie, just delayed disclosure. Jake's actions (using her password) are problematic, which shifts some blame onto him. \n\nOverall, the author's intentions were good, and she planned to be honest. The main issue is Jake's reaction and his privacy invasions. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
