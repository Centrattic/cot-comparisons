We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, that she was previously married. \n\nFirst, the key points from her story: She married Henry to help him stay in the country, they broke up two years later, and she kept the marriage going to help him with his papers. Then she met Jake online, they started dating, and she didn't tell him about the marriage upfront. She planned to tell him in person after they met, but Jake did a background check and found out before she could explain in person. Now Jake is upset, calling her a liar because he feels she withheld important information.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong not to tell him earlier. Let's break it down. When you start a relationship, especially with someone you haven't met in person yet, how much personal information should you share? The author mentions she's the type to not give out too much info early on. She thought meeting in person was the right time to discuss the marriage. But Jake did a background check and found out before she could explain, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, the marriage was valid, and she didn't hide it from her friends or others. She had a reason for keeping it private until meeting in person. However, once a relationship becomes serious, not disclosing a previous marriage could be seen as withholding important information. But the key here is intent. She didn't lie; she omitted the information, planning to share it later. The problem is that Jake felt lied to because the information wasn't there when he found it out through a background check, which might have been part of his own due diligence, but he might have expected her to be upfront.\n\nThe article's author is asking if she's in the wrong. The main factors are: 1) Did she intentionally deceive him? She didn't lie, just didn't disclose yet. 2) Was the information critical to the relationship? Previous marriage isn't always a deal-breaker, but it's personal. 3) How did she handle the disclosure? She was going to tell him in person but he found out first. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) discussions, the community often looks at intent and harm. If the author had no intention to deceive and planned to disclose it, she might not be in the wrong. However, in a trusting relationship, withholding such information could erode trust, especially if one partner does background checks. The fact that she told her best friend about her plan shows she wasn't hiding it but just waiting for the right time.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake's reaction of invading her privacy (getting her password) is clearly wrong, and that's a red flag. His actions are problematic, and he's using her past to justify his behavior, which is not acceptable. So while the author may have had valid reasons for not telling him sooner, Jake's actions are the bigger issue here. However, the question is specifically about the author's fault in not disclosing the marriage.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision to wait to share the information in person might be seen as reasonable, especially if she had no malicious intent. Therefore, she's not necessarily in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. The answer might hinge on whether not disclosing early enough is considered a lie or a necessary omission. Given that she intended to tell the truth eventually and had a plan to do so in person, the author is likely not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
