We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author met Henry, fell in love, got married so he could stay in the country. They broke up two years later, and she promised his family not to divorce until he got his papers. She kept that promise. Then she met Jake online, dated for a couple of months, planned to meet in person. She intended to tell him about the marriage in person. But before meeting, Jake did a background check and found the marriage license. She told him over the phone, explaining her reasoning. Now Jake is accusing her of lying and invading her privacy, using the past marriage as a reason he can't trust her.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong for not telling Jake about the marriage earlier?\n\nFirst, let's consider the timing. They met online, so he's in another country or different location. They were dating for a couple of months, and she didn't feel comfortable sharing such a personal detail early on, especially since she didn't know him in person. She planned to meet and discuss it face-to-face, which seems reasonable. She even discussed it with her best friend, thinking she would tell him in person. The fact that she was going to fly over to meet him suggests that she was taking the relationship seriously enough to meet, but she still thought in-person was better for such a sensitive topic.\n\nThen Jake did a background check and found the marriage license. She told him over the phone when she had to, but he's now using that against her, saying she lied. The key here is whether she was being deceptive. Since she had no intention of hiding the marriage permanently, just waiting to discuss it in person, her actions don't seem like a lie. A lie would be if she had actively concealed the information or denied it when asked. Instead, she was planning to reveal it when they met, which is a responsible approach to a sensitive issue.\n\nAnother angle is the legal marriage. She was legally married during the time she was dating Jake. But she got divorced after her previous husband (Henry) got his papers. So she wasn't married to Henry when she was with Jake. However, the fact that she was previously married is a matter of public record in the marriage license. If Jake did a background check and found the license, it's possible he didn't realize the timeline. But she did explain that she was going to tell him in person. The fact that she kept her promise to Henry's family and waited until after his papers were sorted also shows she wasn't trying to deceive Jake for her own benefit.\n\nJake invading her privacy by getting her password and using it is a separate issue. His actions of using a background check might be excessive or controlling, especially if he was checking her without her consent. That behavior could indicate a lack of trust or healthy boundaries in the relationship, which might contribute to his current issues with the marriage disclosure.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author didn't lie; she intended to disclose the information when she met him in person. She had a reason to wait, and she did inform him as soon as she found out he had discovered it. The fact that Jake is still holding it against her and not taking her explanation into account might indicate his own issues with trust or jealousy, rather than the author being in the wrong. Her actions seem reasonable given the circumstances, and she wasn't hiding the marriage for deceitful reasons.\n"
