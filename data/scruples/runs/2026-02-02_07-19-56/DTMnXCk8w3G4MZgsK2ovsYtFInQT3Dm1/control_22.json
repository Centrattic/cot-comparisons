We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their current boyfriend (Jake) they were married, before meeting him in person. So the situation is they were previously married to Henry, got divorced after two years because they broke up, and stayed married to help Henry get his papers. Now they're dating Jake and didn't tell him about the marriage upfront online, planning to tell him in person after they met.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if not disclosing the marriage early on in the relationship is wrong. The user argues that they didn't feel comfortable giving out too much info early, especially online, and planned to tell him in person. They also mentioned discussing this with their friend before meeting. Then Jake did a background check and found out, leading to privacy issues and distrust.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, withholding information about a past marriage could be seen as a big deal because marriage is a significant life event. However, the user had a valid reason to stay married for legal purposes and did plan to disclose it in person. The timing might matter here. If they had not told him after meeting in person, that might be different, but they were planning to during the visit. The fact that they discussed it with their friend shows they intended to be honest once the time was right.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake might feel misled because there was a period where he thought he was in a relationship with someone who wasn't married. The user didn't lie directly; they just didn't disclose the marriage. It's more of an omission than a lie. But since Jake did a background check, maybe he expected transparency, and the user's delay in sharing caused issues.\n\nBut the user's reasoning for waiting seems reasonable\u2014privacy concerns, not wanting to overshare online. The problem arises from Jake's trust issues now, which are his own reaction. The user did plan to tell him in person, which is a responsible approach. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
