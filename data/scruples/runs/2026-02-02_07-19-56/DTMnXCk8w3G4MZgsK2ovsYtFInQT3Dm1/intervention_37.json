We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend she was married. So first, I need to look at the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author married Henry to help him stay in the country. They broke up amicably two years later, and she kept the marriage for his papers. Then she met Jake online and didn't disclose the marriage until they were planning to meet in person. She mentioned talking to her friend about how to tell him. But Jake did a background check and found out, which upset him because he felt lied to.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author didn't lie; she just withheld information. She had a reason\u2014planning to tell in person. But Jake felt betrayed. Now, the question is whether her withholding the information was wrong. \n\nLegally, being married and not disclosing it when entering a new relationship could be problematic. But in terms of relationships, honesty is usually expected. However, the author's intentions were to be honest when the time was right. The issue is whether withholding such a significant detail is considered lying, even if the intention was to be truthful later.\n\nJake's reaction includes invading her privacy, which is a red flag in any relationship. His actions (using her password, etc.) complicate the issue. The author's decision might not be malicious, but relationships require transparency from the start. The fact that she kept it a secret even after discussing it with a friend suggests she knew it was important. So, while her intention wasn't to deceive, the act of withholding such a big secret might still be seen as wrong. However, Jake's overreaction and privacy violations are also his responsibility. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often weigh intentions vs. impact. The author's impact on Jake's trust was significant, but so was Jake's breach of privacy. The question is whether the author is at fault. If the community typically sides on honesty being essential, then maybe A. But if they consider the circumstances and Jake's actions, maybe B. I need to check similar cases. Usually, not being upfront about a past marriage can be seen as a major issue because it affects the new relationship's foundation. So the answer might be A. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
