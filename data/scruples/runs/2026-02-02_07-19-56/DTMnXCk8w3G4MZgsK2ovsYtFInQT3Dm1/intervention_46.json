We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman who married her ex-boyfriend (Henry) to help him stay in the country, then later dated a new guy (Jake) online. She didn't tell him about the marriage until after he did a background check and found out. Now Jake is upset, accusing her of lying, and invading her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if she was still married when she started dating Jake, that's bigamy, which is illegal in many places. But the situation is that she was married but later broke up with Henry. So if the divorce was finalized, then she's not legally married anymore. The key point here is whether the marriage was still valid when she started dating Jake. If she was divorced, then technically she's not lying, just not disclosing past marriages. However, if the divorce wasn't finalized and she was still legally married, then she's in legal trouble.\n\nFrom the story, she promised not to divorce Henry until he got his papers. So if those papers took time to process, she might have been married during the time they were dating. The user needs to clarify if the marriage was still active when she started dating Jake. If she was still married, then she did lie about her marital status, which is a serious issue. If she was divorced, then she wasn't lying, just not mentioning a past marriage.\n\nAlso, the context of not disclosing online because of privacy concerns and planning to tell in person is important. It's common for people to share personal information gradually in a new relationship. However, the fact that Jake did a background check and found the marriage license complicates things. If the marriage was already over, maybe Jake's reaction is unfounded. But if she was still legally married, then she was deceptive.\n\nConsidering the ethical side, there's the question of trust. Even if the marriage was past, withholding such a significant life event can be seen as a breach of honesty. The author might have had good intentions, but not being upfront could be seen as a lie by omission. On the other hand, if the marriage was a past situation and she was honest when he found out, maybe it's a misunderstanding.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate if that's the case. If the marriage was still active, then yes. If it was over, then maybe not. The story mentions that the marriage was two years before the breakup and that the author kept her promise until Henry got his papers. So perhaps the divorce was finalized before she met Jake. But the timeline isn't entirely clear. If the divorce was final, then the author isn't in the wrong. If not, she is. The story says she married Henry to help with his immigration and then broke up two years later. If the divorce took time after the breakup, maybe she was still married when she met Jake online. But she broke up with Henry before meeting Jake. So if the divorce was finalized after the breakup but before meeting Jake, then she was still married when she started dating Jake, which would make her in the wrong. But if the divorce was finalized before the breakup, then no. The key detail here is the timeline of the divorce. The story says she broke up with Henry and then a year later met Jake. If the divorce was finalized after the breakup but before meeting Jake, she was still married when dating Jake. If the divorce was during the breakup process, maybe it's different. The story states: \"we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things.\" So the marriage happened before the breakup, and the breakup was two years after the marriage. Then a year after the breakup, she met Jake. If the divorce was finalized during the breakup, then she was single when she met Jake. But if the divorce wasn't finalized until after the breakup, then she was still married when she met Jake. The story says she promised not to divorce until he got his papers. If the papers were obtained during the breakup, then the divorce would have been after the breakup. So if the divorce was finalized after the breakup, then when she met Jake, she was already divorced. Therefore, she wasn't lying about being married; she was disclosing a past marriage. However, when Jake found out, he might have felt lied to because she didn't mention it before. The author's reasoning is that she didn't want to share personal info early in an online relationship and planned to tell in person. That's a common approach, but withholding such a significant detail could be seen as dishonest. The user's friend's reaction about trust is valid because not being upfront can erode trust, even if the information is true. So while the author might not be legally in the wrong if she was already divorced, ethically, there's a case to be made that she should have been more transparent earlier. However, given the complexity of the situation and the reason for the marriage, the answer might depend on the specific timeline of the divorce. If the divorce was finalized before meeting Jake, B (not in the wrong). If not, A (in the wrong). The story doesn't specify whether the divorce was finalized before meeting Jake. The key line is that she promised not to divorce until he got his papers. If the papers were obtained after the breakup but before meeting Jake, the divorce would have been finalized then. But the story says she broke up with Henry two years after the marriage and then a year later met Jake. If the divorce was finalized after the breakup but before meeting Jake, then she was not married when she met Jake. So she's not in the wrong. If the divorce was pending, then she was still married. The story says she kept her word, so she didn't divorce until he got his papers. If the papers were obtained during the breakup process, then the divorce was finalized after the breakup. So she was divorced when she met Jake. Therefore, the answer is B. But the user might be in the wrong if she didn't disclose the past marriage even though it was over. However, not everyone discloses past marriages unless asked. So ethically, it's a gray area. The answer might be B because she wasn't lying if she was divorced. But Jake's reaction is about trust, which is subjective. The main issue is whether she was still married. If she was divorced, then B. If not, A. Based on the story, she broke up with Henry, then a year later met Jake. If the divorce was finalized during the breakup, then she was divorced. So B.\n"
