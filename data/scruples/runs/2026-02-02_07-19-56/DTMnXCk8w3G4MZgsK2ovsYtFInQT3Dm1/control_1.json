We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, that she was previously married. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. She married Henry to help him stay in the country because his employer couldn't sponsor him. They broke up amicably, and she stayed married to help him get his papers. Then she met Jake online and started dating. She didn't tell him about the marriage until after he did a background check and found out. She planned to tell him in person but he found out before she could.\n\nSo, the main question is whether not disclosing her previous marriage upfront was wrong. From what I know, being honest in a relationship is important, especially when it comes to legal matters like past marriages. But she had reasons for not telling him immediately. She mentioned she didn't want to give out too much info early on, especially since they hadn't met in person. She intended to tell him in person, which she discussed with her friend.\n\nHowever, the issue is that she was legally married during the time she was dating Jake. Even if the marriage was no longer valid (since they divorced), the fact that she was married and then divorced is something significant. If she was still legally married when she started dating Jake, that's a problem. But if she was divorced before starting the relationship, maybe not. Wait, the story says that she broke up with Henry two years before meeting Jake, and that she stayed married to help him get his papers. So maybe she was still married when she started dating Jake? Wait, the timeline: she married Henry a few years back, broke up two years later, then met Jake a year after the breakup. If she was still married during the breakup, then she was in the process of getting divorced. If she was divorced before meeting Jake, then she wasn't married when she started dating him. But she says she promised Henry's family not to divorce him until he got his papers. So maybe she was still married when she started dating Jake. If that's the case, then she was already married when she started a new relationship, which would be a problem. However, if she was divorced before meeting Jake, then she wasn't married during the relationship, and her not disclosing a past marriage might not be an issue. \n\nWait, the key point is whether she was still married when she started dating Jake. If she was still married, then not telling Jake about an ongoing marriage would be a big issue. If she was divorced, then it's a past marriage, and she might not need to disclose it unless it's relevant. The story says she broke up with Henry two years before meeting Jake, and that she stayed married to help him get his papers. So she might have been divorced after a year post-breakup, meaning when she met Jake, she was already divorced. Wait, the breakup was two years before meeting Jake, and then a year after the breakup she met Jake. So the timeline is: breakup happened two years after the marriage (which was a few years ago). Then a year after the breakup, she met Jake. So the breakup was two years after the marriage, and then she met Jake one year after the breakup. So let's say the marriage was five years ago. She broke up with Henry three years ago (two years into the marriage), and met Jake two years ago (one year after the breakup). If she stayed married for a year after the breakup to help him get papers, then she might have divorced him after that year. So when she met Jake, she was already divorced. Therefore, she wasn't married when she started dating Jake. So her previous marriage is in the past, and not disclosing that she was once married might not be a problem. However, if she was still married when she met Jake, then it's a big issue. The user says she broke up with Henry (they're still good friends) two years after the marriage, and then a year after the breakup she met Jake. So if the marriage lasted, say, two years, then she broke up with him, stayed married for another year (to help with papers), then divorced. So when she met Jake, she was still married. That would mean she was married when she started the relationship with Jake, which is a problem. So she was in a legal marriage and having another relationship, which would be bigamy or adultery, depending on the jurisdiction. However, if she was in the process of getting a divorce and the divorce was final before she started dating Jake, then it's not the same. The story says she promised his family that even if they broke up, she wouldn't divorce him until he got his papers. So she stayed married for a year after the breakup. If that year passed, then she was divorced before meeting Jake. Therefore, she wasn't married when she started dating Jake. So her previous marriage is in the past, and she wasn't currently married. Therefore, not disclosing a past marriage might be considered okay, especially since she intended to tell him in person. However, some people might argue that honesty is important, and she should have been upfront. But if she was divorced and not currently married, then it's a past relationship, and maybe not something she's obligated to disclose unless asked.\n\nBut there's another angle: the fact that she was married and then divorced is part of her past, and if Jake did a background check and found out, maybe he felt deceived because she didn't volunteer the information. Even if it's in the past, he might feel that she should have been more honest. However, the author's reasoning is that she didn't want to bring it up early in the relationship, especially since they hadn't met in person. She planned to tell him when they met. But he found out before that. \n\nSo, considering all that, if she was divorced before meeting Jake, then she wasn't in a current marriage, and not disclosing a past marriage isn't necessarily wrong. But if she was still married when she started dating Jake, then that's a problem. The story says she broke up with Henry two years after the marriage, then a year after the breakup, she met Jake. So if the breakup happened, but they stayed married for a year after the breakup (to help with his papers), then the divorce happened a year after the breakup. So she met Jake a year after the breakup, which would be right when she was getting divorced. So she was still married when she started dating Jake. Therefore, she was in a legal marriage while starting a new relationship, which is problematic. In that case, she's in the wrong because she was already married when she started dating Jake, which is illegal in many places (bigamy). However, if the divorce was finalized before meeting Jake, then it's not an issue. The story is a bit unclear on the exact timeline. The key point is whether she was married at the time of the relationship. If she was still married, then she's in the wrong. If she was divorced, then she's not. The story says she stayed married to help him get papers, and then after a year, they divorced. If she met Jake a year after the breakup (and thus after the divorce), then she's not in the wrong. But if the breakup and divorce happened after she met Jake, then she is. The user needs to clarify the timeline. However, based on the information given, the user says she broke up with Henry two years before meeting Jake, and that she stayed married to help him. So if the breakup was two years before meeting Jake, and they stayed married for a year after the breakup, then she divorced him a year after the breakup. So when she met Jake, she was already divorced. Therefore, she wasn't married when she started dating Jake. So not disclosing a past marriage isn't wrong. However, Jake might feel she should have been more upfront. But legally, she wasn't in a current marriage. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, if the timeline is that she was still married when she met Jake, then A. But the way the story is told, the divorce happened before meeting Jake. So B.\n"
