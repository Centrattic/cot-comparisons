We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her previous marriage before they met in person.\n\nSo, the situation is she married Henry years ago to help him stay in the country, later broke up amicably. Then she started dating Jake online and didn't mention the marriage until after he did a background check. She planned to tell him in person but he found out earlier. Now Jake is upset, claims she lied, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. When should someone disclose a past marriage? Legally, if she's divorced, it's not a lie to not mention it unless asked. But ethically, if they're in a serious relationship, maybe she should have been upfront sooner. However, she mentioned she didn't want to give too much info early on, especially since they hadn't met yet. She had intentions to tell him in person, even discussing it with her friend.\n\nJake's reaction is that she lied. But was she lying? She didn't explicitly say she wasn't married; she just didn't mention it. If she was divorced, it's not a lie. But if the marriage was still valid, then not disclosing could be an issue. Wait, the story says she married Henry, then broke up two years later, so she must have divorced him. The article says she kept her word to not divorce him until he got his papers. So she's divorced by the time she meets Jake. So she's not married when she meets Jake. So she's not currently married.\n\nBut the problem is that when Jake did a background check, he found the marriage license. So technically, she wasn't lying because the marriage was in the past and she was divorced. She just didn't proactively mention it. The issue is whether she had an obligation to disclose a past marriage. If they're in a serious relationship, maybe she should have been more open earlier. But she had her own concerns about privacy and timing.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, maybe she's not at fault because she intended to tell him in person and didn't consider it necessary to bring up past relationships early on. However, Jake's trust issues are valid because he found out through a background check, which might feel like a breach of trust. But was she wrong? If she was divorced and had no intention to hide it, just waiting for the right time, maybe not. But if she knew he was doing a background check, maybe she should have been prepared to explain earlier. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether not disclosing a past marriage is considered a lie. Since she was divorced, she's not lying, but withholding information could be seen as a lack of transparency. So the answer could go either way. However, the user initially thought she's in the wrong, but legally/ethically, she might not be. So the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
