We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend about being married before they started their relationship. \n\nFirst, the situation: She was married to Henry, who had to leave her country for work, so they got married to help him stay. They broke up two years later, but she stayed married to help him with his papers. Now she's in a new relationship with Jake, and she didn't tell him about her marriage until after he did a background check and found out. Jake's upset because he feels she lied.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, when starting a new relationship, especially a serious one, honesty is important. The author didn't mention her marriage until after they were already dating and he found out through a background check. She says she didn't tell him earlier because she didn't want to give out personal info early in the relationship and planned to tell him in person. \n\nBut from Jake's perspective, not disclosing a past marriage, especially one that's still active (since she didn't mention divorce), could be seen as a lie. Even if the marriage was for a specific reason, not being upfront could lead to trust issues. The fact that she had a password and invaded privacy might have exacerbated the situation, but the core issue is the initial disclosure.\n\nHowever, there are mitigating factors. She did plan to tell him in person and discussed it with a friend. She might not have realized the importance of mentioning it earlier. The marriage was for a practical reason, which could be seen as a valid context. But in a new relationship, withholding such a significant detail, even if well-intentioned, can be problematic.\n\nThe key here is whether not telling him was a lie. If she didn't correct the assumption that she was single, that's a problem. Marital status is a big part of a relationship, so not being honest about that could be seen as deceptive. Even if her intentions were good, the omission led to Jake feeling betrayed. \n\nSo, while her reasons are understandable, the act of not being upfront about her marital status when entering a new relationship could be considered her fault. Therefore, the answer would be A, she's in the wrong.\n"
