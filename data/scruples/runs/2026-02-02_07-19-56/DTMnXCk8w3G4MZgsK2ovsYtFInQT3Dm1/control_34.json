We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she married her previous boyfriend, Henry, to help him stay in the country. They broke up after two years, but she stayed married because she promised his family not to divorce him until he got his papers. Now she's in a new relationship with Jake, and she didn't tell him about the marriage upfront. She planned to tell him in person after they met, but Jake did a background check and found out. He's now accusing her of lying because she didn't tell him immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't lie; she was married at the time but planned to disclose it when she met him. The problem is that Jake feels she withheld important information. The main question is whether withholding such information is a lie. A lie would be an intentional deception, but here she was planning to tell him in person. However, she didn't disclose it when they were already dating online. \n\nMarital status can be a significant detail in a relationship, especially since it affects legal and emotional aspects. By not telling him upfront, even if she had good intentions, she might have violated his trust. But on the other hand, she had reasons for waiting\u2014like wanting to meet in person and discussing it face-to-face. She also mentioned this to her friend, so she wasn't planning to hide it forever. \n\nJake's reaction is about trust, which is valid because undisclosed marriages can lead to issues. However, the author's intention wasn't to deceive but to choose the right moment. The line between withholding information and lying can be blurry here. If she had no intention of hiding it and was going to tell him when they met, maybe it's not a lie. But depending on the context of their relationship, like how serious it was, not disclosing might be seen as a mistake. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions might not be a lie but a poor judgment in timing. She didn't have malicious intent, but she did withhold important information that could affect the relationship. So, the answer might depend on whether intent matters more than the outcome. If the question is about being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. Some might say yes because she didn't disclose upfront, others might say no because she had good intentions. But since Jake did a background check and found out, which complicates things, maybe the author's position is not entirely wrong. However, the fact that she was still married when starting the new relationship could be seen as problematic regardless of intentions.\n"
