We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author married Henry to help him stay in the country, then divorced after two years. Later, she dates Jake online and doesn't tell him about the marriage until after he does a background check. She planned to tell him in person, which she mentioned to her friend. But Jake feels she lied and can't trust her because of it. He invades her privacy in response, like using her password.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I need to decide if that's the case. \n\nWhen you're in a relationship, especially after meeting in person, there's an expectation of honesty. Not disclosing a past marriage, even if it was going to be revealed later, might be seen as a lie by omission. The author could have mentioned it earlier when discussing her background. However, she had a plan to tell him in person, which she communicated to her friend, so she wasn't planning to hide it forever. \n\nJake's reaction is problematic too; invading privacy isn't acceptable. But the main question is about the author's actions. Did she lie? She didn't actively say she wasn't married; she just didn't disclose it. Intentions matter. If she had no intention of hiding it permanently, maybe it's not a lie. But withholding such significant information could be seen as deceptive, especially if he found out through a background check, which he might have done for a reason (like checking for criminal history, not marital status). \n\nMarried status isn't a criminal record, so the background check might not have been necessary. His trust issues stem from this, but his response is also inappropriate. However, the author's decision to not tell him upfront might be seen as a mistake because it led to a breach of trust. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the marriage is in the past, it's a major life event. Not mentioning it until after a background check might make Jake feel like he was kept in the dark. The author's reasoning is valid\u2014to wait until meeting in person\u2014but in the context of a relationship, honesty from the start is usually expected. \n\nSo, maybe the author is partly at fault for not being upfront, even if her intention was good. Jake's actions are wrong, but the question is about the author's wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nWait, but some might argue that she wasn't lying, just withholding information she intended to share later. If she planned to tell him in person, that's honest in her own mind. The problem is the timing. However, the line between honesty and deception can be blurry. In this case, since she did tell him eventually and was planning to, maybe she's not at fault. But the fact that he found out through a background check he did for reasons unrelated suggests that she should have been proactive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Jake overreacted by doing a background check and invading privacy. The author's mistake was not being clear from the start. On the other hand, she might have had a right to privacy about her past. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. The key is whether not disclosing the marriage was a lie. If she never said she wasn't married, and planned to tell him, maybe it's not a lie. But in a relationship, not being forthcoming can still be seen as a lack of transparency. So the answer could be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she didn't lie, just delayed disclosure. But others might see it as a lie by omission. \n\nI think the answer is B. She didn't lie; she intended to tell him. The problem is Jake's overreaction and his own behavior.\n"
