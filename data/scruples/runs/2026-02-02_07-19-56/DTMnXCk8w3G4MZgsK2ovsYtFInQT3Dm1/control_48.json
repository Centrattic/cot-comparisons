We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is at fault for not telling her boyfriend she was married. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author married Henry to help him stay in the country when they were dating. They broke up later, but she didn't divorce him until he got his papers. So she's still legally married when she starts dating Jake. She didn't tell Jake right away, waiting until after she bought a ticket to meet him. She planned to tell him in person but he found out through a background check before that. Now Jake is upset, accusing her of lying, and invading her privacy.\n\nSo the main question is whether she was wrong not to disclose her marriage earlier. Legally, she's still married, so she's not in a position to marry again, but she's not hiding it from him completely. She intended to tell him in person, which seems reasonable. Jake did a background check, which might be his own fault for not trusting her. She explained her reasoning, but he's still upset. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she didn't lie. She was going to tell him but chose the timing. However, not disclosing something as significant as being married early on could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, she had a valid reason for waiting until in-person. Different people have different expectations about when to share personal information. Since she wasn't hiding it and planned to tell him, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that waiting too long is deceptive. But the key is that she didn't actively lie; she omitted information. The answer probably leans toward her not being in the wrong (B), but it's a bit tricky. However, considering she was planning to tell him and the context, B seems correct.\n"
