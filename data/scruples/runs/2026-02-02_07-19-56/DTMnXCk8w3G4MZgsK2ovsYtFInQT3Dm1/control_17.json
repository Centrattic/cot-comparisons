We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't tell her current boyfriend, Jake, that she was still married until after he found out through a background check. She had married Henry a few years back to help him get his papers, stayed married after the breakup, and then when she started dating Jake, she planned to tell him in person during a planned visit. However, Jake did a background check and found out earlier than she intended.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author married Henry to help him stay in the country, which is a common scenario I've heard before. They broke up two years later but stayed married to fulfill her promise to his family. Then she starts dating Jake online, doesn't mention the marriage initially, and plans to tell him face-to-face during a visit. She even discusses this with her best friend about how to approach it. But Jake finds out through a background check before she could tell him, leading to trust issues because he feels lied to.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was wrong for not disclosing her marital status earlier. Legally, if she's still married, that's a big deal because bigamy is illegal in many places. However, the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing rather than legal. The author had a valid reason to stay married for Henry's legal status, and she intended to be honest once the time was right. She planned to meet in person and even discussed it with a friend, showing she wasn't intentionally deceptive but rather chose timing and context for the disclosure.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake did a background check, which is something someone might do in a serious relationship, but it's also an invasion of privacy to some extent. His reaction of not trusting her despite her explanation complicates things. The author's reasoning is that she didn't feel comfortable revealing such personal information early in an online relationship, which is understandable. Many people are cautious about sharing sensitive details until they feel more secure in a relationship.\n\nThe key factors here are intent. The author didn't lie; she omitted information that she planned to disclose later. The question is whether this omission is considered a lie. If a lie is defined as an intentional untruth, then omitting information isn't a lie. However, some might argue that in a serious relationship, transparency should be expected from the start, especially regarding major life events like marriage. But given the context\u2014starting online, not meeting in person until later, and the author's intentions to be honest\u2014her approach can be seen as reasonable.\n\nJake's invasion of privacy (getting her password) is a separate issue, but it's being used by the author to justify his lack of trust. However, his actions (using her password) are also problematic and might be contributing to the trust issues. The author's responsibility here is to disclose her marital status, which she intended to do, but his response is also part of the dynamic. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often looks at intent, actions, and whether there was malice. The author's actions were based on a promise and a plan to be honest, even if delayed. She didn't hide the marriage to deceive but to manage the timing. So, from that perspective, she's not in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
