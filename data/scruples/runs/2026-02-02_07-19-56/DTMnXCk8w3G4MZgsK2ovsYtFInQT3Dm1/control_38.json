We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author didn't tell her current boyfriend, Jake, that she was married to Henry until after he found out through a background check. She married Henry to help him stay in the country, later broke up, and met Jake online. She planned to tell him in person but he found out first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author married Henry for a valid reason\u2014helping him stay for work. She promised to stay married until he got his papers, which she did. Then she met Jake and didn't disclose the marriage initially because she didn't know him well yet. She intended to tell him in person, even discussed it with her friend. But Jake did a background check and found out, then felt betrayed, leading to trust issues and privacy invasions.\n\nThe main question is whether she was wrong to not disclose her previous marriage earlier. Legally, she was married but is now divorced? Wait, the story says she broke up with Henry a year before meeting Jake. Wait, the original post says she was married to Henry, and after breaking up, she still stayed married to help him get his papers. So she wasn't divorced yet. So when she's dating Jake, she's still legally married to Henry. Wait, that's a problem. If she's still married when she starts dating Jake, then she's committing adultery, which is illegal in many places. However, in the scenario, she's married to Henry until he gets his papers. So when she starts dating Jake, she's still legally married. That's a big point. So technically, she's in a current marriage when she starts a new relationship with Jake. That's a legal and ethical issue. So even if she planned to tell him later, starting a new relationship while still married is wrong. Then, when she finally tells him, after he found out, but she didn't disclose it upfront. So she was in a marriage when she started dating Jake. Therefore, she's in the wrong because she was already married when she started the relationship. \n\nBut wait, maybe Henry and the author were divorced by the time she met Jake? Let me check again. The original post says: \"A year after the break up, I meet a guy...\" So the breakup was two years after getting married. Then a year after the breakup, she met Jake. Wait, the breakup happened two years after the marriage. Then the breakup was a few years ago. Wait, the timeline is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. \n\nOriginal timeline: They got married, lived together, broke up after two years (still married for some time after breakup?), and then a year after the breakup, she met Jake. Wait, if they broke up but remained married (because she had promised not to divorce until he got his papers), then when she met Jake, she was still married. The problem is that she was married when she started dating Jake. So that's a legal issue. Even if she intended to tell him later, being in a relationship while married is wrong. So she's in the wrong for starting the relationship while still married. Therefore, AITA? Yes, she's in the wrong. But wait, maybe she divorced after the breakup? The original post says she broke up with Henry because of his immaturity, but they stayed good friends. The key point is whether she was still legally married when she started dating Jake. If she was still married, then she's in the wrong. If she got divorced after the breakup, then she's not. Let me check the original story again. \n\nThe story says: \"A year after the break up, I meet a guy...\" So after the breakup, she's still married because she promised not to divorce until he got his papers. Therefore, when she met Jake, she was still legally married. That's a problem. So she was in a relationship with Jake while still married to Henry. That's adultery, which is illegal in many jurisdictions. Therefore, she's in the wrong for starting the relationship while still married. Additionally, she didn't disclose her marital status to Jake upfront. So both the act of being married during the relationship and not disclosing it are issues. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong). \n\nJake's reaction of mistrust is understandable because she was married when they started dating. Even if her intention was to tell him later, she was already in the wrong by not being upfront from the start. So the author is at fault here.\n"
