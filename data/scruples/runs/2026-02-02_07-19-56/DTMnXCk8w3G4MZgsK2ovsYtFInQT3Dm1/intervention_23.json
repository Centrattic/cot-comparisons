We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend she was married. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, she married Henry to help him stay in the country. They broke up, stayed friends, and she kept the marriage to help him get his papers. Then she met Jake online and didn't tell him about the marriage until she planned to meet in person. She called her friend for advice on how to tell him, but Jake did a background check and found out before she could.\n\nNow, Jake is upset that she didn't tell him upfront. He even used her password and invaded her privacy, which complicates things. The author thinks she's not at fault because she intended to tell him in person, but Jake feels lied to.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Legally, she was married, so technically, she was married when she started dating Jake. But she had a valid reason for hiding it\u2014she wanted to tell him in person and had planned to. However, not disclosing such a significant detail at the start of a relationship could be seen as a lack of honesty, even if her intention was good.\n\nThe key points are her intent to be honest when meeting in person versus Jake's expectation of upfront disclosure. If they were in a committed relationship early on, withholding such major information could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, she did plan to be honest and even consulted a friend. The fact that Jake did a background check complicates things because he took steps to uncover her past, which might not have been his place.\n\nBut the main issue here is the timing and context. If she was already in a dating relationship with Jake and was married, not disclosing that could be considered a lie by omission. Even if she had good reasons, the act of not telling him before he found out through a background check might make her at fault in his eyes. The fact that Jake used her password to invade her privacy is his own wrongdoing, but that doesn't absolve her of the responsibility to be honest.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is crucial. While she had a plan to be honest, the fact that she didn't disclose it when he asked questions or when it was relevant (like during the background check) could make her the antagonist. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, withholding such a significant detail could be seen as a mistake. So, the author might be at fault for not being upfront when Jake started the background check, even if her intention was to tell him in person later.\n"
