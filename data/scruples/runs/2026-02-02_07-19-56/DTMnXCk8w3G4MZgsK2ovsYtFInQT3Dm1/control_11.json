We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person, let's call her Alice, married Henry to help him stay in the country. They broke up two years later but stayed friends, and she kept the marriage until he got his papers. Then she met Jake online. She didn't tell him about the marriage upfront because she didn't want to give too much info early on, especially since they hadn't met in person yet. She planned to tell him in person after they met, but Jake did a background check and found out before she could. She explained her reasoning, but Jake still trusts her less, accuses her of lying, and invades her privacy.\n\nSo, is Alice in the wrong? Well, she was married at the time she started dating Jake, so technically, she was still married when they started the relationship. However, she had already broken up with Henry and was divorced by then. Wait, the user says she married Henry, then broke up after two years, and kept the marriage until he got his papers. So she was still married when she started dating Jake, but she had no intention of continuing the marriage. The key point is whether she was still married when she met Jake. If she was still legally married to Henry when she started dating Jake, then she was having a relationship while married, which is a problem. But if she had divorced Henry before meeting Jake, then it's not the case. The original story says she broke up with Henry two years after marriage and kept the marriage until he got his papers, which took a year after the breakup. So she was married during her relationship with Jake. That's the main issue. Legally, you can't be married to two people at once, so if she was still married when she started dating Jake, then their relationship would be considered adultery or at least a legal issue depending on where they are. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong in terms of ethics or social expectations.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, when entering a new relationship, it's standard to be honest about past relationships and current status. Even if she was divorced, she should have mentioned the past marriage when it's relevant. But in this case, she was still married when she started dating Jake, which is a big deal. She didn't disclose her marital status upfront. So ethically, she's being dishonest by not telling Jake about being married when they started dating. She had a reason (planning to tell in person), but the fact remains that she was married when they started the relationship. That's a significant truth that affects the trust in the relationship. Jake's reaction is partly because he feels lied to. Even if she intended to tell him in person, she didn't make that information available when he started the relationship. So yes, she's in the wrong for not being upfront about her marital status when they began the relationship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
