We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is at fault for not telling her boyfriend Jake that she was married before meeting him in person. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author married Henry for practical reasons to help him get his papers. They stayed married for two years and then broke up but remained friends. After the breakup, she met Jake online. She didn't tell him about the marriage early on, planning to discuss it in person during their planned visit. She even talked to her friend about how to approach it. But Jake did a background check and found the marriage license, so she had to tell him over the phone.\n\nNow, Jake feels she lied by not telling him upfront. The author argues she didn't want to share personal info early in the relationship, especially online. The key points here are honesty and the context of the relationship. \n\nLegally, she wasn't hiding the marriage from the law; she was just being cautious about sharing personal history. However, in a relationship, transparency is usually expected. The author did plan to disclose it in person but didn't do so when Jake found out through a background check. Some might say she should have been upfront about her past to build trust, while others might understand her hesitation to share such details early on, especially in a long-distance setup. \n\nBut Jake might feel that not disclosing it sooner, even if she had good intentions, is a breach of trust. The fact that she kept her word to Henry's family and stayed married for his benefit shows she had a reason, but in a new relationship, honesty is crucial. The issue is whether her decision to wait was reasonable. Since she was planning to tell him eventually, maybe the timing was off. However, the fact that she didn't lie but withheld information might make the judgment more nuanced. \n\nIn the end, while her intentions were to share the marriage info in person, the fact that she didn't disclose it when Jake started the relationship could lead some to think she was misleading. But others might consider the context and her approach as reasonable. The answer might hinge on whether withholding information counts as lying. If lying is defined as actively deceiving, then maybe not. But if truthfulness requires disclosure, then she might be at fault. \n\nGiven the circumstances, I think the author isn't in the wrong because she didn't actively lie and intended to disclose the marriage when they met. Her decision to wait for an in-person conversation shows consideration for his feelings, even if it backfired with Jake's background check. So, the answer is B.\n"
