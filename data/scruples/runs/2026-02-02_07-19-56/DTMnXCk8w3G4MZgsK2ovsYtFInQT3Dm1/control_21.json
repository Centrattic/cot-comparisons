We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her previous marriage right away.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author married Henry, a guy from another country, to help him stay in the country. They broke up amicably two years later. Then she met Jake online and started dating. She didn't mention the marriage initially because she's private and didn't want to give too much info early on. She planned to tell him in person when she visited. However, Jake did a background check and found out before she could tell him. Now Jake feels she lied, and he's invading her privacy as a result.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did she lie by omission? Was she wrong to withhold information about her past marriage? The author argues that she intended to tell him in person and had discussed it with her friend. Jake, on the other hand, felt betrayed because the marriage license showed up in a background check.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, honesty is important in relationships. However, the context matters. The marriage was in the past, ended amicably, and was a different situation. She didn't hide it when confronted; she explained her reasoning. The question is whether not disclosing it upfront was a lie. Since she didn't actively lie but withheld information, some might say she was being dishonest by omission. Others might understand her approach, especially since she planned to reveal it in person. \n\nJake's reaction is also important. He did a background check, which could imply he was distrustful from the start. Using her past against her and invading her privacy seems problematic. If the marriage isn't relevant to their current relationship, his reaction might be over the top. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author had good intentions to be honest when they met, but the method of disclosure might have been delayed. However, since the marriage was in the past and she didn't manipulate or deceive, she might not be entirely in the wrong. The problem here is that relationships require transparency, but context like timing and intent matter. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). She didn't lie intentionally, but her approach to disclosure was delayed. However, Jake's actions (background check, privacy invasion) are his own issues. The fault isn't solely on her.\n"
