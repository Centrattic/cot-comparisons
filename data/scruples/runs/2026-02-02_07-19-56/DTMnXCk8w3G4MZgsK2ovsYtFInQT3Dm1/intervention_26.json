We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author, let's call her Sarah, married Henry to help him stay in the country due to visa issues. They broke up amicably, and she stayed married to fulfill her promise to his family. Then she started dating Jake online. She didn't mention the marriage initially but planned to tell him in person after flying to meet. She even discussed this with her friend when booking the ticket. However, Jake did a background check and found out, leading to trust issues as he accuses her of lying.\n\nFirst, the key points: Sarah was in a legally binding marriage when she started dating Jake. She didn't disclose this upfront, even though it's a major life detail. In many relationships, honesty is crucial from the start. The fact that she planned to tell him in person shows some intention to be honest, but the timing and method matter. Starting a relationship without revealing a prior marriage could be seen as withholding important information.\n\nThe argument for Sarah being in the wrong (A) is that she entered a new relationship while still married, which is legally and ethically problematic. Even if her intentions were good, not disclosing such a significant detail early on could be considered deceitful, especially since she had the means to tell him before the relationship deepened. Trust is essential, and her secretiveness, even if well-intended, eroded that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the argument that her reasons were legitimate\u2014helping Henry with his visa and keeping her word to his family. She didn't hide the marriage from the start, just delayed the disclosure. However, the expectation in a new relationship is usually honesty about one's marital status. Plus, even if she planned to tell him in person, the fact remains that she was married when she started dating Jake. Legally, this isn't allowed in most places, which complicates things further.\n\nJake's reaction, while perhaps extreme, stems from feeling lied to. He might not understand the context, leading to feelings of betrayal. Even if Sarah's intentions were good, the act of not being upfront could be seen as wrong. The invasion of privacy he mentions is another red flag, but that's his fault, not hers. The core issue is her not being honest about her marital status at the beginning.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the decision hinges on whether withholding a major life fact (marriage) is considered lying. Since she didn't disclose it, even with good intentions, it's a matter of whether she's in the wrong. The answer would likely be A, that she is in the wrong, because she entered a new relationship while still married without transparency, which is ethically problematic.\n"
