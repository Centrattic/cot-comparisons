We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (the person who married Henry and is now in a relationship with Jake) is in the wrong for not telling Jake about her previous marriage until they met in person.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: She married Henry to help him stay in the country, then broke up amicably. She promised his family not to divorce him until he got his papers, which she honored. Then she met Jake online, started dating, didn't mention her marriage early on, and planned to tell him in person. However, Jake did a background check and found out before she could tell him. He's upset because he feels she lied by not disclosing it earlier, and now there's trust issues because of privacy invasions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she didn't want to share personal info too soon in a new relationship, especially online. She planned to tell him in person and had even discussed it with her best friend. But Jake feels betrayed and can't trust her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she did get married, but she's not currently married. The key issue is disclosure. In a relationship, honesty is important. However, the timing of when to share personal history can vary. She didn't hide it; she just waited until a more appropriate time. But once Jake found out through a background check, she had to explain it. The problem arises with Jake's reaction\u2014using the past marriage as a reason to invade her privacy. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because she had a valid reason for not disclosing immediately, especially in an online relationship where she's cautious. However, some might argue that she should have been up front about her marital status from the start, especially if it's a significant part of her history. But since she's divorced and the marriage was in the past, maybe she thought it wasn't necessary to bring it up early unless asked. \n\nJake's actions (privacy invasion) are problematic, but the author isn't responsible for his behavior. The core question is whether withholding this information for a while was wrong. Since she intended to disclose it eventually and had a reason for waiting, it's more of a judgment call. In many cases, people might understand that such personal details are shared in time. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
