We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her previous marriage right away. Let's look at the context.\n\nSo, the author married Henry to help him stay in the country. They broke up two years later but stayed friends. Then she met Jake online. She didn't mention the marriage initially, planning to tell him in person when she visited. However, Jake did a background check and found out before the visit. She told him over the phone, explaining her intention to be in person. Now, Jake is upset, calling her a liar because of this.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have an obligation to disclose her previous marriage earlier? The user is asking if she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty is important. However, the author had her reasons. She didn't want to share personal info early in a new relationship, especially since she met Jake online. She planned to tell him in person, which is a reasonable approach to be respectful and considerate. \n\nBut Jake did a background check, which might indicate he had some concerns or perhaps wanted to verify her background. The author didn't actively deceive; she withheld information until a more appropriate time. However, not disclosing such a significant detail, even if there's a plan to tell later, can be seen as a lack of upfront honesty. \n\nOn the other hand, Jake's trust is being affected because he feels lied to. He might feel that any significant information about her past should be shared sooner, especially if they're in a serious relationship. The author's reasoning is understandable, but the timing might have contributed to his mistrust. \n\nIn many relationships, when someone asks, they expect disclosure. Since Jake didn't ask directly, but the author didn't volunteer the info until after the background check, it's a bit of a grey area. However, withholding such a major life event, even with good intentions, can be seen as dishonest because it's not something a person usually discovers unless they actively check. \n\nSo, while the author's intention was to be honest in person, the fact that she didn't disclose it before Jake found out through a background check might make him feel betrayed. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong because she didn't proactively share that information when it's a matter that could affect the relationship's trust. But it's a nuanced situation where both sides might have valid points. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer might lean towards AITA (she is the asshole) because withholding such a significant fact, even with plans to tell later, can be seen as a lack of transparency, which is important in relationships.\n"
