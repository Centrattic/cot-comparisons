We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend she was married. So, the situation is that she met someone named Henry, married him for immigration reasons, then broke up. Later, she starts dating Jake online and didn't tell him about the marriage upfront. She planned to tell him in person but he found out through a background check.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. When you're in a relationship, honesty is important. But there's context here: the marriage was a legal arrangement to help Henry stay, and she stayed married even after breaking up. Now, when she starts dating Jake, she didn't mention it early on. She thought meeting in person was better, and she even discussed this with her friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether not disclosing the marriage immediately is lying. The author didn't hide it; she was planning to tell him in person. But Jake did a background check and found out. He's upset because he feels she lied. But technically, she didn't lie\u2014she just didn't disclose it upfront. The issue is about timing and the method of disclosure.\n\nNow, in relationships, transparency is crucial. If someone asks a direct question like \"Are you married?\" and you don't answer truthfully, that's a problem. But here, she didn't actively lie. She omitted information she intended to share later. The problem is that Jake might have considered full disclosure necessary before meeting in person, especially if there were legal implications like divorce proceedings or immigration status that could affect their relationship.\n\nHowever, she had valid reasons for waiting, like planning to tell him face-to-face. The fact that she discussed it with a friend shows she was considering the right approach. The main issue here is trust. Jake's actions (invading her privacy) are problematic, which complicates the situation. His response suggests that he's using the marriage as a reason to distrust her, even after she explained her reasoning.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. Legally, she wasn't in the wrong; she didn't commit a crime. Ethically, it's more nuanced. Some might argue she should have been more upfront, while others might see her method as reasonable. Since the marriage is already dissolved, the main concern is how the information was shared. If Jake felt it was a significant enough issue to breach trust, that's on him as well. However, the fact that she didn't actively hide it but planned to share it in person might mean she's not entirely at fault. So, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
