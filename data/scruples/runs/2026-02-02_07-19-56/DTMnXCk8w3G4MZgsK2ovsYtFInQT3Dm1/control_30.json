We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who married her ex-partner to help him stay in the country, then later started dating someone else (Jake) and didn't tell him about the marriage until after he did a background check. Now Jake is upset and accuses her of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married Henry to help him with his visa, then broke up but stayed married to fulfill her promise to his family. When she met Jake, she didn't disclose the marriage initially but planned to tell him in person. However, Jake found out through a background check and feels betrayed. He's now invading her privacy, using her password, and accusing her of lying.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was wrong for not telling Jake about her past marriage upfront. Legally, she was married, but they are now divorced? Wait, the post says she broke up with Henry two years after the marriage, but she didn't divorce him. Wait, no\u2014wait, the user says: \"I broke up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity... I promised his family that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word.\" So she's still technically married to Henry because she didn't divorce him, even after breaking up. That's important. So when she started dating Jake, she was still legally married. That's a big deal because bigamy is illegal in many places. So if she's still married, then dating someone else while married is legally problematic. But maybe she didn't know that? Or maybe the marriage was annulled or dissolved through some other means? The post doesn't mention divorce, so legally, she's still married.\n\nWait, but the user says she broke up with Henry and is still married. So if she's still married, then dating Jake without divorcing Henry is illegal. Therefore, when she was dating Jake, she was in a bigamous relationship. So if Jake found out she was still married, then technically, she was lying by omission if she didn't disclose that she was still married. But she broke up with Henry, so maybe they were in a legal separation? But the user says she didn't divorce him, so legally, they're still married. Therefore, when she started dating Jake, she was still married. So that's a problem.\n\nSo the author is in the wrong because she was still married when she started a new relationship with Jake, which is bigamous. Therefore, when she didn't tell Jake about the marriage, she was misleading him about her marital status, which is a significant issue. Even if her intention was to tell him in person, the fact that she was still married makes the situation illegal, so not disclosing it upfront was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, maybe the marriage was dissolved in some way? The post says she kept her word not to divorce him until he got his papers. So if the marriage was still valid, then she's in a legally unrecognized marriage. But if the marriage was legally dissolved through some process (like annulment or divorce), then it's different. The user says she didn't divorce him, so the marriage is still valid. Therefore, she's still married when she starts dating Jake, which is bigamy. Therefore, she's in the wrong for not disclosing that she's still married. So the answer is A.\n"
