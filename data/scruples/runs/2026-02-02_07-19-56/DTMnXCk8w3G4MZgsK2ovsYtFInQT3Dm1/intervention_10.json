We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she married a guy named Henry to help him stay in the country, then broke up but stayed married to fulfill her promise to his family. Now she's dating Jake and didn't tell him about the marriage until after he did a background check and found out. She planned to tell him in person, but he's upset and accuses her of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She didn't disclose her marital status upfront when dating Jake. The question is whether that makes her at fault. Legally, if she's still married, she can't legally marry Jake, but the question isn't about legality here. The user is asking if she was wrong in not telling him. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, honesty is usually expected, especially about something major like being married. However, she had a valid reason\u2014she wanted to tell him in person and had discussed it with her best friend. She also mentioned that she was in the process of keeping a promise to Henry's family, which might have been a factor in her decision.\n\nBut Jake felt betrayed because she didn't tell him upfront. Even if her intention was good, withholding such information could lead to trust issues. The fact that Jake used her password to invade her privacy complicates things, but the main issue here is the author's actions. \n\nThere's a difference between not disclosing information immediately versus actively lying. She didn't lie; she just didn't mention her marital status until later. However, when asked directly or when the situation requires, honesty is crucial. Since Jake found out through a background check, it's possible he felt the need to verify her information, which might indicate his own concerns.\n\nThe author's reasoning\u2014waiting to tell him in person\u2014could be seen as considerate, but in a developing relationship, transparency is important. Depending on cultural or personal expectations, there might be varying opinions. Some might argue she was being cautious, others that she was being deceptive by omission.\n\nSince the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether not telling him upfront constitutes wrongdoing. If the standard in a relationship is full disclosure from the start, then she might be at fault. But if the context of her situation (helping Henry, planning to disclose later) is considered, maybe not. However, Jake's trust issues stem from her not being upfront, so she might share some responsibility. But the key is whether she intended to deceive. The author explains her reasoning, so it's not a lie, but withholding info. \n\nIn many cases, withholding such significant information until after a background check is done could be seen as wrong because it affects the foundation of the relationship. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA (She is at fault) but there's nuance. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, not just AITA. So if the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nGiven that she didn't lie, but withheld information that could affect the relationship, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in relationships, full transparency is usually expected. So even if her intentions were good, she might be in the wrong. But others might argue that she had a plan to disclose it and that Jake's reaction is harsh. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether not disclosing upfront is considered wrong. Since she didn't lie, but didn't tell the truth either, maybe it's a case of not being fully honest. So the answer could be A (yes). But some might side with B (no) because she had a reason and planned to tell him. However, the act of not telling him from the beginning could be seen as wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards A because in a new relationship, significant marital status should be disclosed early to avoid trust issues. Even if she planned to tell him, not doing so upfront might be considered wrong.\n"
