We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her previous marriage until after he found out through a background check.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. She married Henry to help him stay in the country, stayed married for two years, then broke up but stayed friends. She promised his family not to divorce him until he got his papers. Then she met Jake online, didn't tell him about the marriage initially but planned to when they met. She even discussed it with her best friend before buying the ticket. But Jake did a background check, found the marriage license, and confronted her. She told him over the phone after buying the ticket, but he's upset about the timing and accuses her of lying.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether she was wrong for not disclosing the marriage earlier. The user is asking if her actions were in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider intent and context. She had a valid reason to wait until meeting in person, as she didn't want to share too much early in an online relationship. She even planned to discuss it in person and had discussed it with a friend. However, Jake's perspective is that she \"lied\" by not telling him sooner, which is affecting their trust now.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, she was married and later divorced, so technically, she wasn't married to Henry when she started dating Jake. But the key here is transparency in relationships. The question is whether withholding such a significant life event (a past marriage) from the beginning is considered dishonest, even if the intention was to share it in person once the relationship progressed.\n\nIn many cases, people might expect important details like past marriages to be disclosed early, especially if there's a possibility of future marriage or commitment. However, since they met online and she had a plan to share it in person, her reasoning isn't entirely unreasonable. The problem arises when Jake felt betrayed by the timing of the disclosure, leading to privacy issues and trust problems.\n\nBut was she actually in the wrong? It depends on societal norms. Some might argue that she should have been upfront from the start, while others might agree that her intention to share it in person was appropriate. The fact that she had a valid reason (to avoid premature disclosure in an early online relationship) and had planned to tell him might tip the balance towards her not being in the wrong. However, the fact that she didn't tell him immediately when he asked about her past, or when the topic came up, could be seen as a lie of omission.\n\nBut given the context, she was being proactive about telling him in person. The issue is more about the method and timing rather than a deliberate lie. Since she wasn't currently married when she started dating Jake, the past marriage isn't as relevant unless he was planning to marry her. However, if privacy invasion and trust issues are now occurring because of this, it could complicate things.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and whether the person acted with dishonesty. If she had no intention to deceive and had a plan to disclose, she's less likely to be in the wrong. But if she knew he was going to find out through a background check and that it would cause issues, maybe there's some fault. However, she couldn't have predicted the background check, and she did disclose as soon as she could when she realized he had found out.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she had a plan to disclose in person and didn't intend to deceive. But there's a gray area where some might say she should have been more upfront.\n"
