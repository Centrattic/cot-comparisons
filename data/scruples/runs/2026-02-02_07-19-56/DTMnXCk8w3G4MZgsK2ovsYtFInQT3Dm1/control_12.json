We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, that she was married to a previous partner, Henry. She married Henry to help him stay in her country for work purposes, and they later broke up. Now, she's with Jake, and she didn't disclose the marriage when they first started dating, especially since they met online. She planned to tell him in person but he found out through a background check.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She had a legal marriage for a specific reason\u2014helping Henry with his visa. It wasn't a secret from Henry's family, and she kept her promise to them about not divorcing until he got his papers. The main issue with Jake is the timing and method of disclosure. \n\nShe mentions that she's not one to give out personal info early in a relationship, especially with someone she hasn't met yet. She intended to tell him in person after they started meeting in person. However, Jake did a background check and found out, leading to trust issues because he felt she was dishonest. \n\nThe key points here are intent and communication. She didn't lie; she omitted information. The question is whether omitting such a significant detail (a past marriage) is considered lying. Legally, if she was divorced when she met Jake, then the prior marriage wouldn't affect their current relationship. However, ethically, some might argue that being upfront about past marriages is important for trust and transparency.\n\nBut her reasoning was to protect their early stages of the relationship and to disclose in person. However, Jake might feel that any hidden information is a breach of trust. The fact that she had a plan but didn't communicate it until he found out through a background check might be where she went wrong. If she was planning to tell him, maybe she should have communicated that intention earlier or sooner once they started meeting in person. \n\nAlso, considering that Jake did a background check, maybe he expected her to be honest about all aspects of her past. Even if her intention was good, the fact that he discovered it through a check and felt lied about could mean she was in the wrong for not being proactive in disclosing. \n\nHowever, others might argue that she had valid reasons to wait and that the marriage was a past event not affecting their current relationship. The fact that she was planning to tell him in person could mitigate the issue. But since he found out through a check, maybe she should have been more upfront earlier.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't disclose a legally significant detail that could affect trust, even if her intent was to tell him in person. Omission in such a case might be seen as dishonest, especially if the information could be discovered through a background check. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if the law in her country requires disclosure of past marriages. If she was divorced and there's no legal requirement to mention it, then maybe it's not her fault. However, the ethical aspect of transparency in a relationship is important. So, likely A.\n"
