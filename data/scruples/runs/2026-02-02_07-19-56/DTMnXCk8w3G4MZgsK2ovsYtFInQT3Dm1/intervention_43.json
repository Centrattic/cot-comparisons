We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author married Henry to help him stay in the country. They were married for two years, then broke up but stayed friends. The author didn't divorce Henry to help with his papers, which makes sense because she promised his family. Then she meets Jake online and starts dating him. She doesn't tell him about the marriage initially, planning to do so in person. She even discusses this with her best friend before buying a ticket to meet him. However, Jake does a background check and finds out about the marriage license. She tells him over the phone, explaining her reasoning. Now, Jake is accusing her of lying because he feels she withheld information, even though she had plans to disclose it in person. He's invading her privacy as a result.\n\nSo the main issue is whether not disclosing her marital status upfront was a lie or a withholding of information. The author argues that she planned to tell him in person and had discussed it with her friend. But Jake feels that she should have been upfront from the start, especially since the marriage license is a public record that he could check. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and transparency are important. However, the author's reasoning is that she was protecting her privacy and wanted to share personal info face-to-face. But when Jake did a background check, that's when the issue came up. The author didn't lie; she just didn't disclose it until later. However, depending on the expectations in their relationship, not being upfront about such a significant detail might be seen as deceptive. \n\nOn the other hand, Jake's actions of invading her privacy could be a bigger problem. The author's intention wasn't to deceive but to share in a more personal setting. The fact that she had planned to tell him and discussed it with her friend might support her position. But there's also the aspect that the marriage was a legal status that could affect their relationship, so withholding that information\u2014even with good intentions\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nI think it's a bit nuanced. If the author had no intention of hiding it and genuinely planned to disclose it in person, she's not entirely in the wrong. However, not being upfront when a background check could easily reveal the information might be seen as misleading. So maybe the answer is B (she's not in the wrong) because she didn't lie, but her failure to disclose might have been careless. Alternatively, if the expectation was full transparency from the start, then she might be at fault. But given the context, I lean towards B.\n"
