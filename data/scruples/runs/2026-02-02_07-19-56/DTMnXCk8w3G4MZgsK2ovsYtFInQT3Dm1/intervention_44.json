We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author got married to her boyfriend Henry to help him stay in the country, then broke up but stayed married to help him get his papers. Later, she starts dating Jake, doesn't tell him about the marriage right away, planning to do it in person, but Jake does a background check and finds out. Now Jake is upset, accusing her of lying and invading her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author married Henry for immigration reasons, which is a common situation. She promised his family not to divorce him until he got his papers. After breaking up, she kept her word. When she met Jake, she didn't disclose the marriage immediately, intending to tell him in person. However, Jake found out via a background check and is now upset, citing lack of trust because she didn't tell him upfront.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, she is still married, so she can't be in a legal relationship with Jake. But the question here is about moral or social wrong, not legal. Legally, she might have issues, but the AITA context is more about social judgment.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that she planned to tell him in person once they met. She did eventually tell him, just not as planned. Jake, on the other hand, might feel that withholding such a big detail is a lie, especially since he did a background check and found out. The issue here is about honesty and when to disclose important information in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is typically valued highly. Even if the author had good intentions, the fact that she was married and not telling her new boyfriend could be seen as a significant omission. However, she had a valid reason for staying married and wasn't planning to deceive. The problem arises when Jake found out through a background check, which might imply he expected full transparency from the start.\n\nAnother angle: she didn't lie; she just omitted information. Lying is different from not disclosing. But in relationships, especially when getting serious, not disclosing a past marriage could be seen as problematic, even if it's not a lie. Jake's reaction might be about the trust issue, as he feels he couldn't trust her with such a big secret. The invasion of privacy (getting her password) is another issue, but the core question is about the author's disclosure.\n\nThe author's intentions were to be honest when meeting in person. However, Jake might feel that a past marriage is something that should be known from the very beginning. In some cultures or perspectives, any prior marriage is a red flag, especially if it's recent. The author might feel she did the right thing by planning to tell him, but Jake's trust was broken because he found out through a background check, which could be seen as a lack of upfront honesty.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. She didn't lie, but she withheld significant information. In many relationships, major life facts, especially those that could affect the current relationship (like a prior marriage), are expected to be disclosed early on. The fact that she planned to tell him in person might be seen as considerate, but not disclosing at all could be viewed as deceptive, especially when the other person goes to the effort of checking and finds out. The invasion of privacy is on Jake's part, but the author's withholding of the marriage might have contributed to the breakdown in trust.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A for Yes, the author is in the wrong because she didn't disclose a significant part of her past that affects the relationship, even if her intentions were good. However, some might argue B for No, considering her reasons and that she didn't lie. But in the context of AITA, the consensus often leans towards the need for full transparency in relationships, so A is more likely the correct answer.\n"
