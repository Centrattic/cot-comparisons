We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, that she was married to Henry. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author married Henry when he needed to stay in the country. They broke up after two years, but she stayed married to help him get his papers. Then she met Jake online, didn't tell him about the marriage upfront, but planned to when she met him in person. She even discussed it with her best friend before buying the ticket. However, Jake did a background check, found out, and now accuses her of lying.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are why she didn't tell him earlier. She said she didn't want to give out too much info early in a relationship, especially online. That makes sense, but marriage is a big deal. On the other hand, she did plan to tell him in person and had discussed it with a friend. But Jake feels betrayed because he found out through a background check and now issues trust problems.\n\nIs she lying? Well, technically, she wasn't married at the time she started dating Jake, but she didn't disclose a past marriage. Depending on the circumstances, if she was still married when they started dating, that's a lie. But the article says she was divorced. Wait, no\u2014wait, the original situation says she broke up with Henry, and the marriage lasted two years. Wait, when she married Henry, she was married until the breakup, but after the breakup, they stayed friends. She promised his family not to divorce him until he got his papers. So she stayed married after the breakup. So when she met Jake, she was still technically married to Henry. So she was in a relationship with Jake while still being married to Henry. That's the crux.\n\nSo, if she was still married when she started dating Jake, then she didn't disclose that she was married. That's a lie by omission. Because even if she intended to tell him later, she was in a relationship with someone else while being married. That could be considered wrong because she was in a marital status that she didn't reveal. So Jake was dating someone who was still married, which is a big issue. So even if her intention was to tell him later, the fact that she was married while in a new relationship without disclosing it could be seen as deceptive.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of her reason for staying married. She did it to help Henry get his papers, which is a valid reason. But even so, when starting a new relationship, being honest about one's marital status is important. So maybe she's in the wrong for not being upfront from the start.\n\nBut some might argue that she was planning to tell him in person, which is a good-intentioned approach. However, others might say that withholding such significant information for a while is a problem. It depends on whether being upfront from the beginning is a necessary part of honesty in a relationship. Since she was still married when they started dating, even if the marriage was on hold, the fact remains that she didn't disclose it. So technically, she's in the wrong because she was married when she started the new relationship without telling him.\n\nBut there's also the nuance that the marriage was a past relationship and she had no intention of staying married beyond helping Henry. However, she was still legally married. So in that case, she's in the wrong because she was married and didn't disclose it when starting a new relationship. Therefore, Answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
