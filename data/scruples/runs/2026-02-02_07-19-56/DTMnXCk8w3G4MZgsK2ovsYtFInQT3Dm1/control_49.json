We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person who married Henry and later dated Jake) is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend Jake about her previous marriage before they started seeing each other.\n\nFirst, the background: She married Henry, then broke up but stayed married to help him get his papers. She didn't divorce until after he got them. Then she met Jake online. She didn't tell him about the marriage right away, planning to do it in person. But Jake did a background check and found out, leading to trust issues.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether not disclosing her marriage initially was a lie or a misstep. When you're in a new relationship, especially online, there's usually a process of getting to know each other. She didn't hide the marriage; she just waited to tell him in person. She even planned to discuss it when they met. However, Jake felt betrayed because he found out through a background check, which he might have done to verify her background.\n\nNow, is she a liar? A lie is when you intentionally deceive someone by providing false information. In this case, she didn't say she wasn't married. She just didn't disclose it immediately. When asked about her marital status, she could have been upfront, but if the question wasn't asked, she's not obligated to volunteer that info. She did eventually tell him when she planned to meet him. However, Jake might argue that not telling him sooner was a lie of omission, especially if he expected full disclosure from the start.\n\nBut wait, she had a reason to delay: she was still legally married, and she had a commitment to Henry's family to stay married until he got his papers. She kept that promise, so there's a context where she couldn't divorce earlier. So, she wasn't hiding a past marriage after being divorced; she was still married. However, when she started dating Jake, she was already divorced. The timeline is a bit confusing here. Let me check again.\n\nShe married Henry, broke up but stayed married for his visa. Then after a year, she met Jake. She was still married when they started dating. She didn't tell him until after he found out through a background check. Wait, that's a problem. If she was still legally married when she started dating Jake, then she was committing bigamy, which is illegal. However, the story says she broke up with Henry two years after they married and stayed married until he got his papers. Then, after a year of being single, she met Jake. So if she was divorced before meeting Jake, then she's not at fault. But if she was still married when she started dating Jake, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the user says: \"A year after the break up, I meet a guy online...\" So she broke up with Henry two years after they married, then a year later met Jake. So when she started dating Jake, was she already divorced? Let me parse the timeline again.\n\nOriginal timeline:\n- Met Henry, got married to help with his visa.\n- Two years later, broke up but stayed married.\n- A year after breakup (so three years after marriage), met Jake. So at the time of meeting Jake, she was still married. That's the key point. Because even though they were broken up, they were still legally married. So when she started dating Jake, she was still married. So that's a problem. Bigamy is illegal in many places. So if she was still married when she started dating Jake, then she's in the wrong. But if she had already divorced Henry before meeting Jake, then she's not. The user's story says she broke up with Henry but stayed married for his papers. So she was still married when she met Jake. Therefore, she was technically married when she started the relationship with Jake. That's a legal issue and a moral one. However, in the story, she says she planned to tell him in person. So she wasn't hiding it, just delaying disclosure. But the fact that she was married to someone else when she started dating Jake is a problem. She could have told him from the start that she was married but planning to get a divorce once his papers were sorted. However, if she was already divorced when she met Jake, then she's not at fault. But according to the story, she was still married when she met Jake. So that's a problem. Therefore, she's in the wrong because she was married when she started the relationship. But wait, maybe she got divorced before meeting Jake. Let me check again. The user says: \"I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity... I kept my word.\" She promised not to divorce until he got his papers. So she stayed married to help him. Then, after he got his papers, she would have divorced him. But when she met Jake, was she already divorced? The timeline says she met Jake a year after the breakup. The breakup was two years after the marriage. So she broke up with Henry two years after marriage, but stayed married. Then, a year after the breakup (so three years after marriage), she met Jake. So during that year after the breakup, Henry got his papers, which would allow her to divorce. So if she had divorced before meeting Jake, she could have told him she was divorced. But if she met Jake before getting divorced, then she was still married. The user's account is a bit ambiguous on when the divorce happened. She says she kept her word to not divorce until Henry got his papers. So if Henry got his papers a year after the breakup (i.e., three years after marriage), then she divorced after that. But she met Jake a year after the breakup (three years after marriage). So if she met Jake before Henry got his papers, then she was still married. If she met Jake after Henry got his papers and they divorced, then she was single. The user's story isn't clear on the exact timeline. But given that she met Jake a year after the breakup, and the breakup was two years after marriage, it's possible that during that year after the breakup, Henry got his papers, and then she divorced. Then she met Jake after being divorced. However, the user's story doesn't specify when the divorce occurred. This is a critical point. If she was still married when she met Jake, then she's in the wrong for being married during the relationship. If she was already divorced, then she's not. The user's story says she broke up with Henry two years after marriage, but stayed married. Then a year after the breakup (so three years after marriage), she met Jake. The divorce might have happened after that, but the user doesn't specify. If she was still married when she met Jake, then she's in the wrong. If she was divorced, then she's not. The user says she \"promised his family that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers.\" So she stayed married until he got his papers. Therefore, she was still married when she met Jake. If that's the case, then she was married when she started the relationship with Jake, which is a problem. Therefore, she's in the wrong for being married during the relationship with Jake. However, if she divorced after meeting Jake, then she's not. But the story doesn't clarify. The user's answer hinges on whether she was married when she started dating Jake. Since the user's story says she met Jake a year after the breakup (when she was still married for Henry's papers), it's likely she was still married when she met Jake. Therefore, she's in the wrong. However, some might argue that she had a valid reason to stay married and planned to disclose it eventually. But the fact remains that she was married when starting a new relationship, which is a lie by omission if the new partner expected them to be single. So the answer depends on the timeline. If she was married when she met Jake, then she's in the wrong. If she was divorced, then not. Since the story doesn't specify when the divorce happened, but says she met Jake a year after the breakup (when she was still married), the answer is A (she is in the wrong).\n"
