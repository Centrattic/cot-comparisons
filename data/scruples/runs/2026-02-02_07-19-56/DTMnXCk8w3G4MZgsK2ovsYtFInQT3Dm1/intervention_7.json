We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is at fault for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her past marriage before they met in person.\n\nFirst, the circumstances: She married Henry to help him stay in the country, then divorced after two years. After breaking up, she met Jake online and started dating. She didn't mention the marriage initially because she's private and wanted to meet in person. She even planned to tell him during their in-person meeting but got found out when he did a background check. Now Jake feels she lied, even though she intended to tell him eventually.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, the key points here are intent and context. She didn't hide it with malicious intent. She explained she was being cautious because it's a sensitive topic and preferred to share it face-to-face. She even discussed it with her best friend about how to approach the conversation. The issue seems more about Jake's reaction and his invasion of privacy (using her password, etc.) rather than her withholding the information. Legally, she wasn't hiding it in a way that's deceitful; she was just waiting for the right time. Emotionally, though, Jake might feel betrayed, but that's on him to handle the privacy breach. The user initially thought she's in the wrong, but considering all factors, maybe not. So the answer is B.\n"
