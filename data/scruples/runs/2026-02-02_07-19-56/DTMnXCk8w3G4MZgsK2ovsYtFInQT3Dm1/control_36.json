We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their current boyfriend (Jake) about their previous marriage before meeting him. Let me go through the details.\n\nSo, the author married Henry when he was in the country on an internship. They stayed together, then broke up two years later, but stayed friends. The author promised Henry's family they wouldn't divorce until he got his papers. After breaking up, she met Jake online. She didn't tell him about the marriage initially because she didn't want to share personal info early in the relationship. She planned to tell him in person when they met, but Jake did a background check and found out.\n\nNow, Jake is upset because he feels she lied by not telling him upfront. He's even invaded her privacy by getting her password. The author is asking if she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. If she was legally married, even if divorced, she might have had to disclose that if asked directly. But in this case, Jake didn't ask her about her marital status initially. The author didn't lie; she just didn't volunteer the information. She intended to tell him in person, which she did when she had to because he found out. \n\nHowever, from Jake's perspective, he might feel that withholding this information is a form of lying by omission. The problem here is the interpretation of honesty in a relationship. If they're in a serious relationship, certain personal details are usually shared. But the author had her reasons for waiting, thinking it's more appropriate to share in person.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake's actions (invading privacy) are definitely wrong. Using her password without permission is a breach of trust, regardless of the initial situation. The author's responsibility is to communicate honestly, but Jake's actions are his own issue. \n\nThe key point is whether the author was obligated to disclose her previous marriage when it wasn't asked. Since she didn't lie and planned to tell him, maybe she wasn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that not being upfront about such a significant detail could be seen as a lie of omission. But given the context and her intention to share in person, it's more about timing rather than deception.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether a lie of omission counts as being in the wrong. In many cases, people might say that while not directly lying, withholding such information can be hurtful. However, the author's reasoning is understandable. The fact that Jake did a background check might be his own fault for not trusting her from the start. The invasion of privacy is his problem, not hers. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
