We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about not telling her current boyfriend (Jake) that she's married because she had a past marriage to Henry. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author married Henry while he was in the country on an internship, partly because he needed her help to stay legally. They broke up amicably two years later, and she stayed married to help him with his papers. Now she's dating Jake, and she didn't mention her marriage status until after he did a background check and found out. She planned to tell him in person but he found out earlier.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and when information is shared. The author didn't lie outright; she just didn't disclose the marriage until Jake found out. She had a legitimate reason for wanting to talk in person, especially since it's a sensitive topic. However, the fact that she was married and then filed for divorce might be something that affects the current relationship. \n\nJake's issue is about trust because he feels lied to. But the author didn't actively lie; she just didn't volunteer the information immediately. The difference between lying and omitting is important here. Lying is saying something false, whereas omitting is not sharing the truth. So technically, she isn't lying, but she might be responsible for not disclosing something significant when asked or when it's relevant.\n\nHowever, in relationships, being upfront about past marriages is usually expected, especially if the person is in a new relationship. The author might have thought waiting until the in-person meeting was appropriate, but Jake could argue that he had a right to know sooner. The fact that she had discussed this with her best friend shows she was thinking about transparency, but maybe she didn't consider that Jake should have been told before their meeting.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. If the author was still legally married to Henry when she started dating Jake, that could be a legal issue depending on the jurisdiction. But the story says she had already broken up with Henry two years before meeting Jake, and she stayed married to help him with his papers. If she was divorced by the time she met Jake, then it's not an issue. However, if she was still married when she started dating Jake, that's a problem. The story doesn't specify if she was divorced, but she mentions \"filed him in\" which might mean she filed for divorce, but it's not clear if it was finalized. If the divorce wasn't finalized, then she was still married and having a relationship with Jake would be bigamy, which is illegal in many places. That's a crucial detail the story might be missing.\n\nAssuming the divorce was finalized, then the issue is more about disclosure. If she wasn't legally married anymore, not telling Jake immediately could be seen as a breach of trust, but not a lie. If she was still married, that's a different scenario. The story says she broke up two years after marriage, so it's possible the divorce took time, but she might have been in the process. The exact timing of the divorce is unclear.\n\nJake's invasion of privacy and using the password is another issue, but that's separate from the initial disclosure. The user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not telling. If she was divorced, then not disclosing until after the background check might be a mistake in judgment but not necessarily wrong. If she was still married, then it's definitely wrong. The story doesn't make it clear, but the fact that she said she was married and then filed for divorce might mean the divorce wasn't final when she met Jake. That would make her actions illegal. However, the story says the marriage was two years before the breakup, and she was still married until he got his papers. If the divorce was finalized after that, then she wasn't married when she met Jake, so not disclosing might just be a transparency issue. But if the divorce wasn't final, then it's a bigger problem.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether she was legally married when she started dating Jake. If yes, then she's in the wrong. If not, then it's about transparency. The story mentions she broke up two years before and then stayed married until he got his papers. If the breakup was two years before meeting Jake, and the divorce was finalized after he got his papers, then she wasn't married when she met Jake. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for not disclosing unless Jake asked directly. However, in relationships, being upfront about past marriages is important, so there might be a gray area. The fact that she planned to tell him in person shows intent to be honest, but Jake's reaction is about trust. The key is whether she was still married. If she wasn't, then it's about transparency, not dishonesty. If she was, then it's a legal issue. Since the story doesn't clarify the divorce timeline, but she said she stayed married until he got his papers, which might have been after the breakup, it's possible she was divorced when meeting Jake. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for not disclosing upfront, as long as the marriage was over. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
