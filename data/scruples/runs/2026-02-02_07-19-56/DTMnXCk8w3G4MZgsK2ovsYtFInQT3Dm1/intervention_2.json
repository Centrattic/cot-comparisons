We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the author married Henry to help him stay in the country, then broke up but stayed married to fulfill a promise to his family. Later, she starts dating Jake online and doesn't tell him about the marriage until after he does a background check. Now Jake is upset because he feels she lied and invades her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author didn't disclose her marital status upfront. She planned to tell him in person after meeting, but she had bought the ticket and discussed it with her friend. However, Jake found out through a background check, which makes him feel betrayed. The question is whether she was wrong to not tell him earlier.\n\nMarriage is a significant detail, especially in a new relationship. When building trust, honesty is important. Even if she had a valid reason for waiting, withholding such information could be seen as deceptive. But maybe there's context\u2014she had a good reason to protect Henry's situation. However, relationships require transparency. If she had an obligation to be honest from the start, then delaying could be seen as lying by omission. \n\nOn the other hand, she intended to tell him in person, which shows intent to be truthful. She might not have considered his perspective, but her actions were based on a prior promise. But Jake's trust is now broken because he felt lied to. The invasion of privacy is another issue, but that's on his end. \n\nThe dilemma is whether her delayed disclosure makes her at fault. If she had no malicious intent and had a good reason, maybe not entirely her fault. But in relationships, honesty is key. So she might be in the wrong for not being upfront. Alternatively, considering the circumstances, maybe she's not. \n\nI think the answer depends on the expectation of honesty from the start. If Jake expected full disclosure immediately, then she was wrong. If she reasonably planned to disclose at the right time, maybe not. But generally, withholding a marriage status when it's not trivial could be seen as deceptive. So leaning towards A (yes, she's in the wrong), but there are nuances.\n"
