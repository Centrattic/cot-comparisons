We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person (let's call her Alice) is married to Henry, but she's in a new relationship with Jake. She didn't tell Jake about her marriage initially because she wanted to do it in person after meeting. Jake found out through a background check and now is accusing her of lying.\n\nSo, the main question is whether Alice is in the wrong for not telling Jake about her marriage earlier. Let me consider the key points here. \n\nFirst, Alice married Henry to help him stay in the country. They later broke up, but she stayed married for his immigration reasons. That's a real situation some people go through, where legal status is tied to marriage. She made a promise to his family to not divorce until he got his paperwork. That seems like a significant reason for maintaining the marriage. \n\nNow, when she starts dating Jake, she's hesitant to share personal details early on, especially since they met online. She planned to tell him in person, which she thought was more respectful. However, Jake did a background check and found out. So, she ended up telling him over the phone instead. \n\nThe issue here is honesty and timing. Alice didn't lie; she just withheld the information until she felt it was appropriate to share in person. The problem arises when Jake feels betrayed because the information wasn't disclosed upfront. But is that really Alice's fault? She had a valid reason for not wanting to share it online early in the relationship. \n\nAlso, Jake's reaction seems extreme. Using a background check to find out about a past marriage is a bit invasive, but maybe he felt it was necessary for his own peace of mind. However, Alice had every intention of telling him, just in a different way and time. \n\nAnother angle is the fact that she's still married. If Jake knew she was married, he might have considered that a deal-breaker. But Alice was upfront once she found out he discovered it, and she had planned to tell him. The fact that she was still married when starting the relationship with Jake is a red flag, but the context of her marriage (for immigration purposes) complicates things. \n\nIs it wrong to not disclose a past marriage early on in a new relationship? Well, if she was still married and planning to divorce, but couldn't for legal reasons, then maybe it's a necessary disclosure. However, she did plan to tell him in person. The key here is whether withholding the information when she had intended to share it when the time was right. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. But there's also the aspect of timing and context. If someone has a good reason to withhold certain information temporarily, it's debatable. However, if Jake found out through a background check, that suggests he needed to know for some reason. \n\nBut the problem is that Alice was still married when she started dating Jake. Even if the marriage was for immigration purposes, being in a new relationship while still married could be seen as deceptive, depending on the circumstances. If she had divorced Henry before starting the new relationship, it would be different. But she was still legally married. So maybe that's where the issue lies. \n\nWait, the user's question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling Jake she was married. If she was still married when they started dating, then not disclosing that is a problem. But the context is that she had a legal and personal reason for remaining married. However, when entering a new relationship, it's important to be honest about one's marital status. \n\nSo, if she started dating Jake while still married, even if she intended to tell him later, that's a form of deception. Because in most places, being married and entering a new romantic relationship could be considered morally wrong or even legally problematic (depending on the country, but generally, bigamy is illegal). So, if Jake had to find out through a background check, that's concerning. \n\nBut Alice's intention was to tell him in person. The problem is that she didn't, and Jake found out. So, she didn't lie per se, but she didn't disclose important information that could affect their relationship. If Jake felt that her withholding the information was a lie, then maybe he's not entirely wrong in feeling that way. \n\nHowever, if Alice had a valid reason for not disclosing (like legal obligations and a commitment to her ex's family), that adds context. But legally and ethically, being in a relationship while still married is problematic. \n\nSo, the key points are: Was she deceptive? She was married and started a new relationship without disclosing it. That's a problem. However, her intention to tell him in person might mitigate the deception slightly. But the fact remains that she didn't tell him, and that could be seen as a lie by omission. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often looks at intent and the impact. If Alice had a good reason and intended to tell him, but Jake felt betrayed, it's a gray area. But legally, being married and in a new relationship is an issue. So, maybe the answer is that she's at least partially in the wrong. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Given that she was still married when she started dating Jake, not disclosing her marital status is a problem. So, the answer might be A. However, the context of her marriage being for immigration purposes complicates it. But generally, being in a new relationship while married is a big deal. So, the answer is probably A.\n"
