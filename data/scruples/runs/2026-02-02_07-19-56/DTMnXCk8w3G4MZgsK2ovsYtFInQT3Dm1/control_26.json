We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend she was married. So first, the situation: She married Henry for visa reasons, then broke up. Then she met Jake online, didn't tell him about the marriage until after he did a background check. Now Jake is upset and accusing her of lying.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty and timing. When you're in a relationship, especially when meeting someone in person, there are certain expectations of disclosure. She was married, but the marriage ended two years before she met Jake. She didn't mention it early on, maybe because she didn't want to give out too much info early. But she planned to tell him in person. However, when he found out through a background check, he felt it was a lie because she didn't tell him upfront.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she didn't hide it entirely. She had every intention to tell him, just not right away. But maybe she should have been honest from the start. Even if she didn't discuss it early on, she was still married when she started dating Jake. Depending on the circumstances, some might argue that she should have disclosed her marital status before the relationship progressed, especially if there's a chance he might do a background check. However, others might understand her reasoning, especially if the marriage was a past situation that had no bearing on the current relationship. But Jake's reaction is about trust and feeling lied to. The line between withholding information and lying can be thin here. If she knew he might do a background check, maybe she should have been proactive. But since she planned to tell him in person, maybe she thought she had time. Still, being upfront about such a significant past detail is important in building trust. So, I think the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't disclose her past marriage earlier enough, leading to the situation where he found out through a background check, which he perceived as a lie.\n"
