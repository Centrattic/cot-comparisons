We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend Jake that she's married to Henry. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author married Henry to help him stay in the country due to sponsorship issues. They later broke up but remained friends, and she kept the marriage until he got his papers as promised to his family. Then she met Jake online, dated him for a few months, and planned to tell him in person when she visited. However, Jake did a background check and found the marriage license, leading to the disclosure over the phone. Now Jake is accusing her of lying and invading her privacy.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong for not disclosing her marriage earlier. Legally, if she was still married during the relationship with Jake, that's bigamy, which is illegal in most places. The problem here is that the author is still married to Henry when she starts the relationship with Jake. Even if the marriage is legally recognized (like an annulment or divorce that's not final), being married and entering a new relationship without disclosing it could be problematic. The author might not have finalized the divorce, which would mean she's still legally married, making her new relationship illegal. \n\nBut wait, the story says she was married to Henry two years after their breakup and then stayed married until he got his papers. A year after breaking up, she started dating Jake. If the original marriage to Henry was for immigration purposes, it's possible it was a sham marriage. In many countries, sham marriages are illegal because they're done to circumvent immigration laws. If that's the case, then the author might have committed a crime by entering a fraudulent marriage. But the question here is about her current relationship with Jake. \n\nAssuming the author's marriage to Henry was legal (maybe they had a real marriage but later separated, and the divorce hasn't been finalized yet), then she might still be legally married. In that case, not disclosing her marital status to Jake could be considered lying, especially if she's still legally bound to Henry. Even if she intended to tell him in person, the fact that she was married during the relationship with Jake is an issue. \n\nHowever, if the marriage to Henry was already annulled or the divorce was finalized before she started dating Jake, then she's not in the wrong for not disclosing it immediately. But the story doesn't mention that she divorced Henry before meeting Jake. She says she kept her word to not divorce him until he got his papers, and the problem arose when Jake did a background check and found the marriage license. This suggests that the marriage might still be legally active at the time of the relationship with Jake. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if the author was still married during the relationship with Jake, that's bigamy, which is a crime. Even if she intended to tell him in person, the act of being married and entering a new relationship is wrong. \n\nFrom a moral or ethical perspective, the author might argue that the marriage to Henry was for practical reasons and that she intended to disclose it once they met in person. But Jake might feel that her not mentioning it after they started dating shows a lack of honesty, especially since he discovered it through a background check, which could imply he was concerned about her background, and she might have withheld important information. \n\nThe privacy invasion (getting her password) is definitely on Jake. However, the author's failure to disclose her marital status when she started the relationship with Jake is a point of contention. If the marriage was still in effect, then yes, she's in the wrong for not telling him. If the marriage was already dissolved, then she's not. \n\nBut the story doesn't state whether the author and Henry divorced before she started dating Jake. It only mentions that she broke up with Henry two years after the marriage. If they were legally married and then separated but not divorced, she's still married when she starts the relationship with Jake. That would make her in the wrong. If they divorced after the breakup, then she's not married anymore. However, the timing is a bit unclear. The author says she kept the marriage until he got his papers. The sponsorship was denied, so maybe the papers were obtained through the marriage, but if the marriage was for the papers, that's a sham, which is illegal. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling Jake, not about the initial marriage's legality. \n\nIn terms of relationships, honesty is key. Even if the marriage was legal, withholding such a major detail from a new partner could be seen as dishonest. Jake might have made decisions based on the assumption she was single. The author's intention to tell in person doesn't excuse the omission, especially if the marriage was active. \n\nTherefore, the answer depends on whether the author was still legally married when she started seeing Jake. If yes, then AITA is on her. If no, then maybe not. But the story suggests the marriage was ongoing until the papers were received, and the breakup was two years before meeting Jake. So if the divorce took place after the breakup, but before meeting Jake, she's not in the wrong. However, if the divorce wasn't finalized yet, she's still married. The problem is the timeline isn't clear. But given that she says she kept her word to not divorce him until he got his papers, the divorce probably happened after he was granted the papers. If that took place before meeting Jake, then she's not in the wrong. But if the divorce was after she started dating Jake, then she was married during the relationship. \n\nSince the story states she met Henry when he was an intern, got married, broke up two years later, and then met Jake a year after the breakup, the timeline is three years after the initial marriage. If the divorce was after the breakup, then she might have been single when she started dating Jake. But the fact that Jake found the marriage license during a background check suggests that the marriage was still on record. Unless the divorce was finalized after Jake found out. \n\nWait, the author says she married Henry for him to get his papers. If the marriage was for immigration purposes, it's likely a sham marriage, which is illegal. In that case, the author is in the wrong for that as well. But the main question is about the current relationship. \n\nIf the author was still married when she started dating Jake, then she's in the wrong for not disclosing. If she was divorced, then maybe not. The story doesn't clarify when the divorce was finalized, so we have to assume that she was still married when she met Jake. Therefore, the answer is AITA for not telling Jake.\n"
