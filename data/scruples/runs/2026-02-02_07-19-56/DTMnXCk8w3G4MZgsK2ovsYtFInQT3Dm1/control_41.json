We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting married to her boyfriend Henry to help him stay in the country, then later marrying him. They broke up two years later, and she stayed married to help him with his papers. Now she's dating Jake, and she didn't tell him about the marriage until after a background check revealed it. Jake is upset and accuses her of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author married Henry for practical reasons, didn't divorce until he got his papers, which she honored. Then, when starting a new relationship, she withheld the marriage information, planning to reveal it in person. However, Jake found out through a background check and feels betrayed. \n\nThe main ethical question is whether the author was wrong for not disclosing her previous marriage earlier. Legally, she was married, so any new relationship could be problematic, but that's not the focus here. Emotionally, Jake feels like she lied. The author's reasoning is that she didn't want to share personal info early, especially with someone she didn't meet in person yet. She even discussed it with her friend and planned to tell him in person. However, she didn't disclose it before he did the background check. \n\nNow, considering the relationship norms: honesty is important, especially about past relationships. If Jake felt the need to check her background, maybe he had trust issues. But the author didn't lie; she was going to tell him in person. However, withholding such a significant detail until he found out on his own could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if her intention was good, not being upfront might contribute to Jake's distrust. \n\nOn the other hand, she had a valid reason for the marriage and kept her promise to Henry's family. Her intention to reveal it in person shows she wasn't trying to deceive. But Jake might feel that the timing was wrong, especially since he discovered it through a background check, which could imply he felt betrayed by not knowing. \n\nLegally, she's not in the wrong because she was married, but ethically, the situation is more nuanced. The key is whether she intentionally withheld information. Since she planned to tell him, it's not a lie, but withholding sensitive info until a background check is a problem. So, maybe she's not in the wrong (B), but there's a gray area. However, the fact that she didn't share it when he started dating her, even if planned to later, could be seen as misleading. But since she wasn't hiding it and intended to be honest when the time felt right, perhaps she's not wrong. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
