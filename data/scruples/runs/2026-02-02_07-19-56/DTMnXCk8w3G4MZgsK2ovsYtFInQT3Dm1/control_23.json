We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she married a guy named Henry to help him stay in the country, then later broke up with him but stayed married to fulfill her promise to his family. Then she starts dating Jake, doesn't tell him about the marriage up front, planning to tell him in person. But Jake does a background check, finds out, and now is upset, saying she lied. The author is asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. When a relationship starts, honesty is important. The author didn't disclose her marital status early on. She had a reason\u2014she didn't want to give too much info early in an online relationship, and she planned to tell him in person. But Jake used a background check to find out. \n\nWait, in many places, if you're married, you can't legally marry someone else. But the author is still married to Henry. If she's now in a relationship with Jake, technically, she can't be married to someone else. So maybe she's in a big problem here because she's already married. That's a legal issue. But maybe the question is more about the withholding of information rather than the legality of the marriage.\n\nBut the main argument here is about honesty. The author didn't tell Jake about her marriage until after he found out through a background check. She had a plan to tell him in person, but she didn't inform him upfront. The question is whether that makes her at fault. \n\nOn one hand, she had a valid reason for not disclosing immediately. She was planning to be honest once they met. On the other hand, she was married and in a new relationship without disclosing that. Legally, she can't be married to two people. So if she started dating Jake while still married to Henry, that could be bigamy, which is illegal. But the question is about whether she was wrong in not telling him, not the legal aspect.\n\nBut the user is asking if she's in the wrong in terms of the situation with Jake. Jake felt lied to because she didn't tell him. She claims she wasn't lying, just waiting to tell in person. But from Jake's perspective, he discovered it through a background check, which he might have done because he was concerned about her background. If she had told him upfront, maybe he wouldn't have needed to do that. \n\nSo the main issue is whether withholding important personal information (being married) is dishonest. Even if she intended to tell him eventually, not telling him at the start could be seen as deceptive. However, her reasoning for waiting might be understandable. \n\nBut legally, being married and entering a new relationship could be problematic. If Jake didn't know about the marriage, he might have believed he was in a relationship with someone available to marry. If they had planned to get married, that's bigamy. But the author isn't planning to marry Jake, just dating him. \n\nSo, in terms of the question, whether she's at fault for not telling him. Some might say yes because she didn't disclose a major life detail, which could affect their relationship. Others might say no because she had a good intention to tell him in person. However, the fact that he found out through a background check suggests that she might have been hiding it, which could be seen as deceptive. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether withholding the information without a clear reason is considered lying. If she had a valid reason and intended to be honest eventually, maybe she's not at fault. But since she was married and didn't disclose it, even if she planned to tell him, it could be seen as a lie of omission. But maybe not a lie, just delayed disclosure. \n\nThe key here is that she was already married when she started the relationship with Jake. If she had divorced Henry before starting the new relationship, there wouldn't be an issue. But since she's still married, the fact that she didn't inform Jake about her marital status could be problematic. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling him. The answer might be that she isn't in the wrong, as she had a plan to tell him in person, but she did have a duty to inform him about her marital status, which is a significant detail. Therefore, she might be in the right if she's not planning to marry Jake, but the lack of immediate disclosure could be seen as a problem. \n\nHmm. It's tricky. The answer might be B (No) because she intended to be honest and had a valid reason for waiting. But others might say A (Yes) because she didn't disclose a major detail early on. I think the community might lean towards B, considering her intention to tell him in person, but some might argue she should have told him earlier.\n"
