We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA post) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, that she's married right away. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author married Henry for immigration reasons, and they stayed married for two years before breaking up. After that, she met Jake online and started dating. She didn't mention the marriage initially because she wanted to tell him in person. However, Jake did a background check and found out, leading to trust issues.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. When she met Jake online, she didn't disclose the marriage until after their relationship had started and a background check revealed it. She had planned to tell him in person, but maybe she should have been more upfront earlier.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, withholding a significant detail like being married, even if the marriage is now over, could be seen as a lie by omission. Even if her intentions were good, not telling him before they got serious might have contributed to his feeling of betrayal. On the other hand, she had a history of keeping the marriage secret for a valid reason (helping Henry get his papers), and maybe she felt it was more respectful to tell him in person.\n\nHowever, in a new relationship, honesty is usually expected, especially about something as significant as a past marriage. The fact that she had a way to tell him in person but he found out through a background check complicates things. Jake's reaction about trust is understandable, even if he overreacted. The author's argument is that she planned to tell him, but she didn't, and that might not be enough.\n\nI think the author made a mistake by not being upfront, even if her intention was to be honest later. The timing and method of disclosure might not justify the omission. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But I should also consider cultural factors or specific circumstances, but the post doesn't mention any. The main issue is the failure to be transparent early on, which can erode trust in a relationship.\n"
