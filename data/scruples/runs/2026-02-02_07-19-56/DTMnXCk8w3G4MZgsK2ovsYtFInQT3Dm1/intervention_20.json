We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who married her boyfriend Henry to help him stay in the country, then broke up and stayed friends. She later starts dating Jake online and doesn't tell him about her marriage until she was planning to meet him in person. But Jake did a background check and found out first. Now, Jake is accusing her of lying and invading her privacy.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she was wrong to not tell him sooner. The user thinks she is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, she's wrong) and B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. She was married to someone else, had a valid reason to wait until meeting in person to disclose it, and even discussed this with her best friend. However, she was still married when she started dating Jake. The issue here is whether it's a lie if she didn't mention it early on. \n\nLegally, she's not lying if she didn't say she's single, but she also didn't disclose her marital status. However, in the context of a new relationship, honesty is usually expected. The fact that she was still married when dating someone else could be seen as deceptive. Even if she had good intentions to tell him later, the omission is a problem. \n\nAlso, the reasons she gave for not telling him immediately\u2014like not wanting to share personal info early online\u2014might be valid, but they don't necessarily excuse the lack of transparency. When entering a new relationship, sharing significant life events like a past marriage is important to build trust. \n\nJake's reaction is concerning because invading privacy (getting his password) is wrong regardless. But his justification for not trusting her because of the marriage disclosure adds another layer. However, the initial issue of not telling him about her marriage when he found out through a background check (which she was going to do in person) is a point of contention. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, honesty in relationships is a cornerstone. Not disclosing such a significant detail, especially when it's a legal status, can be seen as withholding information that affects the nature of the relationship. Even if she had no intention to deceive, the act of not informing him before he found out could be considered a lie by omission. \n\nOn the other hand, she had a plan to tell him in person and even discussed it with a friend. That shows she was thinking about being honest, just timing the disclosure. But the fact that she was still married when dating Jake is a problem. Depending on the legal status of the marriage, she might have been legally married at the time, which is a relevant detail. \n\nSo, the core issue here is whether her reasons for not disclosing immediately are sufficient to absolve her of wrongdoing. The community often looks at intent, but also at the impact. Since the marriage was a material fact in a relationship where she was presenting herself as available, not disclosing could be seen as unethical. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because she was married when starting the relationship with Jake and didn't be upfront about it, even if she intended to tell him later. The privacy invasion by Jake is separate, but the original question is about her actions.\n"
