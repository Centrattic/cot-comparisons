We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her previous marriage until they met in person.\n\nFirst, the situation: She married Henry to help him stay in the country because he couldn't get a sponsorship. They broke up two years later, stayed friends, and she kept the marriage intact to help him get his papers. Then she started dating Jake, met online, and didn't mention the marriage until they were planning to meet in person. She told her best friend about her plan to reveal it in person. However, Jake did a background check and found out first, leading to trust issues.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she was wrong for not disclosing her marital status earlier. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, she had a valid reason to wait. The marriage was already ending, and she had a good relationship with Henry's family by keeping the marriage until he got his papers. She thought it was appropriate to tell in person. She even discussed this plan with her friend, indicating she considered it. In a new relationship, especially online, people often don't share everything immediately. It's understandable she waited until they met.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake might feel that not being upfront about a significant past relationship is a lie, especially since legally she was married. But the key here is intent. She had no intention to deceive; she was planning to be honest when they met. However, she didn't consider that Jake might do a background check, which he did. So, maybe she should have been more proactive in disclosing it earlier, even if she planned to explain later. \n\nBut in many relationships, especially early on, people don't share all their history right away. The fact that she was planning to tell him in person and had even discussed it with a friend shows she was being honest. The problem arose because Jake conducted a background check, which is a bit invasive. His reaction of not trusting her because of this might be an overreaction. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author's intention wasn't to lie. She was being honest but chose a timing that Jake wasn't comfortable with. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong. The real issue might be Jake's trust issues and his actions (using her password, invading privacy) which are more problematic. \n\nBut the core question is whether not telling him until the meeting was wrong. If the law or societal norms expect immediate disclosure of marital status, but in reality, people often don't share such details right away. Since the marriage was already over and she had a good reason for waiting, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that any withholding of such info is a lie by omission. But given the context, she had a valid reason and planned to be honest. So probably B.\n"
