We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (a woman) was married to Henry for a few years, got a divorce, then started a relationship with Jake. She didn't tell him about the marriage until after he did a background check and found out. Now Jake is upset, saying she lied, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is withholding information about a past marriage. The author married Henry to help him get residency, then divorced. She didn't tell Jake about it until he found out through a background check. She had planned to tell him in person after they met, but he found out before that. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Legally, if she's divorced, she isn't currently married, so technically she isn't lying. However, the context of the marriage\u2014marrying for residency purposes\u2014could be seen as problematic. But the main question is about withholding the information. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. However, there's a difference between not disclosing and actively lying. The author didn't lie; she just didn't reveal the information until asked or discovered. She had reasons for waiting, like not wanting to discuss it early in the relationship. \n\nJake's reaction is about trust, but he also invaded her privacy by getting her password. His actions might have contributed to the problem. The author did plan to tell him in person, which shows intent to be honest. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the author isn't currently married, didn't lie, had intentions to disclose, and the context of the marriage was for a valid reason. Jake's mistrust is partly his own action (using her password, invading privacy) and his own issues. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
