We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who married a man (Henry) to help him stay in the country, then divorced him after two years. Later, she starts dating someone new (Jake) online and doesn't tell him about the previous marriage until after he finds out through a background check. Now Jake is accusing her of lying and invading her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. When she met Jake online, she didn't mention her past marriage. She planned to tell him in person when they met, but he found out earlier. The question is whether she made a mistake by not being upfront from the start.\n\nMarriage is a significant life event, and honesty in a relationship is usually expected. However, the context here is important. She married Henry for practical reasons (to help him get papers), which might have been a big decision. She also kept her promise to his family not to divorce until he got his papers. That shows she had good intentions.\n\nWhen dating Jake, she didn't lie per se. She just didn't disclose the marriage initially. The problem is that she withheld information that could be considered relevant, especially in a relationship. People often share major life events, like past marriages, to build trust. By not sharing this upfront, even if she had her reasons, it could be seen as a failure to be transparent.\n\nHowever, her reasoning was that she didn't want to give out too much info early on, especially online. She planned to tell him in person, which she did, just not as soon as he found out. If she had told him before he checked, maybe the situation would have been better. But he discovered it through a background check, which he might have done for his own reasons, perhaps to verify her identity or background.\n\nNow, Jake is holding it against her, saying she's a liar. The question is whether she was wrong for not being upfront. Legally, if she was still married when she started dating Jake, that could be bigamy, but the scenario says the marriage ended before that. So legally, she's not in the wrong. Ethically, though, she could be seen as withholding information that's important for a trusting relationship.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is key. Even if she had good intentions, not sharing such a significant detail could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, she might have been protecting her privacy and planned to disclose it properly. However, once a relationship progresses to a point where a background check is done, it's reasonable to expect that personal information like marital status would be known. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think she was wrong for not being upfront about her past marriage, even if she had her reasons. The key issue is the lack of transparency, which can lead to mistrust. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
