We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that she married her ex-boyfriend to help him stay in the country, then divorced him after two years. Now she's dating someone new, Jake, and didn't tell him about the marriage immediately. She planned to tell him in person after they met, but he found out through a background check. Now he's accusing her of lying and invading her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she was wrong not to tell him upfront. She had a reason: she was meeting him in person and thought it was more appropriate to discuss it face-to-face. She even talked to her best friend about how to tell him. But when he found out through a background check, that might have been a problem because he felt betrayed.\n\nLegally, she was married, so she wasn't lying. She was honest when she told him later. The issue here is more about honesty and trust in the relationship. She didn't hide it permanently; she had a plan to disclose it in person. However, she did wait until he found out through a background check. Maybe she should have been more upfront when they started dating, even if she planned to explain it in person. \n\nJake might feel that she didn't trust him enough to tell him before he found out on his own. But she might have been cautious because she was in the early stages of the relationship and didn't want to share too much information. \n\nAlso, Jake invading her privacy with her password is a problem. His behavior is definitely wrong, but does that absolve her? If she was honest from the start, maybe he wouldn't have felt the need to do a background check. But maybe he would have done it anyway. \n\nIn terms of fault, she didn't lie. She withheld information but had a good reason. However, withholding such a significant detail (a previous marriage) might have been a mistake because it could affect their relationship. So it's a bit of a gray area. But since she did tell him before they met in person and he was okay with it, maybe she's not in the wrong. The key is whether she was being dishonest. Since she was going to tell him, even if he found out first, she isn't lying. So the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
