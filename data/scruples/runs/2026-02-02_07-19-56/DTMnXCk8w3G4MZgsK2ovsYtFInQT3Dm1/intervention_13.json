We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) did something wrong by not telling her boyfriend Jake that she was married before they met in person. \n\nFirst, the backstory: She married Henry for his visa, then divorced after two years. She met Jake online, didn't mention the marriage until she planned to meet him in person. She told her best friend about her plan. Then Jake did a background check, found the marriage license, and she had to tell him over the phone. Now Jake is upset about privacy issues and accuses her of lying.\n\nHmm. Legally, she was married at the time she started dating Jake. But she didn't know him well yet and thought it was better to tell in person. But did she lie? Well, she didn't hide the fact that she was married; she just didn't disclose it until he found out. However, being married is a significant detail, especially if the relationship is moving forward. By not being upfront, maybe she didn't consider that Jake might want that information sooner. \n\nBut she had a valid reason\u2014she didn't want to share personal info early in an online relationship. Also, she kept her promise to Henry's family. However, honesty is crucial in relationships. Even if she had a reason to delay, not being honest about her marital status could be seen as deceptive. Jake might feel that she lied or withheld important information that affects the trust in their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, she wasn't hiding it; she planned to tell in person. But once he found out through a background check, which he did, maybe he felt betrayed because she didn't come clean before that. The invasion of privacy issues might have made things worse, but the root issue is the withheld information.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She had a reason to delay, but withholding a major life fact like being married could be seen as a lie by omission. Depending on cultural or personal expectations, some might see her as wrong for not being upfront, while others might understand her caution. But in relationships, transparency is key. Even if she had good intentions, not being honest about her past marriage might have led to the trust issues Jake is experiencing. So maybe the answer is A, she is in the wrong.\n"
