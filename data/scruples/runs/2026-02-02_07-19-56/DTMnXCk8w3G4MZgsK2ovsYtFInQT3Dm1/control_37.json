We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of an \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not telling their current boyfriend, Jake, about a previous marriage until after he did a background check and found out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author married Henry for practical reasons to help him get residency. They stayed married for two years, then broke up but remained friends. The author promised Henry's family not to divorce until he got his papers, which they honored. Then, the author started dating Jake online, didn't mention the marriage initially because they prefer not to share personal info early, and planned to tell him in person during a visit. However, Jake did a background check and found out first. The author then explained the situation over the phone, as they had planned to do in person. Now, Jake is accusing the author of lying and invading their privacy.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are honesty, timing, and intentions. The author didn't lie; they omitted information that they intended to share eventually. The reason for not disclosing earlier was to avoid giving out too much personal info online and to present the information in person. The author had even discussed the plan to tell Jake in person with a friend. However, Jake felt it was a lie, which might relate to expectations about transparency in the relationship.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, withholding a past marriage might not be a lie if the intention was to disclose it eventually. The author's reasoning for waiting could be valid, especially in an early online relationship where they didn't know each other well. However, Jake's perspective is that the information was discovered through a background check, which he might see as a breach of trust. The invasion of privacy (passwords) is on Jake's side, which complicates things further. \n\nLegally, if there's no ongoing legal obligation (like being legally married still), the author might not be in the wrong. However, ethically, some might argue that important personal information should be shared sooner rather than later, depending on the relationship's seriousness. But the author's intent to disclose it in person suggests good faith. The fact that Jake did a background check might indicate he had some suspicion or wanted to verify things, which could reflect on his own trust issues rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem justifiable. They planned to tell the truth eventually, just in a way they thought was appropriate. The real issue might be Jake's lack of trust and the privacy invasion, which shifts the blame more towards him. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
