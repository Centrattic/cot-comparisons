We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend, Jake, that she was married during their early online relationship.\n\nSo, the situation is that she married Henry for visa reasons, stayed married until he got his papers, then broke up but stayed friends. Later, she starts dating Jake online and doesn't tell him about the marriage until after he finds out through a background check. She planned to tell him in person but he found out earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether not disclosing the marriage upfront was a lie. She didn't hide it entirely; she was planning to tell him when they met in person. However, when he found out through a background check, she admitted the truth. But Jake felt that she lied by not telling him earlier. \n\nMarriage is a significant part of someone's personal history. Even if the marriage was for a specific reason (visa sponsorship), withholding that information during the early stages of a relationship might be seen as misleading. Relationships require honesty, and while she had her reasons, the timing of her disclosure could be questioned. \n\nHowever, she wasn't actively lying; she just postponed telling him until she felt it was appropriate. The fact that she discussed it with her best friend shows she was planning to be honest. On the other hand, Jake's invasion of her privacy (like getting her password) is also problematic and seems to be a separate issue that might have fueled his distrust. \n\nThe key here is whether withholding the marriage info was a lie. Since she intended to disclose it eventually, maybe she was being honest when she didn't mention it yet. But the expectation in relationships is usually to be upfront about major life facts, especially when there's a background check involved. Jake might have been concerned about her honesty because he found out through an unexpected method, leading him to feel deceived. \n\nSo, there's a balance between her right to privacy and the expectation of transparency in a new relationship. I think the author might be in the wrong because even if the marriage was a past situation, not disclosing it when he did a background check could be seen as a breach of honesty. However, others might argue that she had a valid reason to wait. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and considering that Jake found out through a background check which he might have done for various reasons (like verifying her identity or past), her omission could be seen as a lie by omission. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, she wasn't hiding it; she was just waiting for the right time. If she had told him in person as planned, maybe the situation would be different. But since he found out through a background check and she didn't mention it even after being asked indirectly, maybe that's where the issue is. So, maybe she is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: she didn't misrepresent her current marital status because the marriage was in the past. If she had been married at the time of the relationship, that's different. But she was divorced. So, if she was legally married during the relationship, that's a problem. Wait, the timeline: the marriage ended two years before the breakup, then she met Jake a year after breaking up. So she was divorced when she started dating Jake. Therefore, she wasn't currently married when she started the new relationship. But she didn't disclose the past marriage. \n\nIn that case, not disclosing a past marriage might not be a lie, but it's a significant detail that could affect the relationship. If Jake felt it was important to know about her past marriage early on, then she should have shared it. However, if she wasn't asked directly and planned to share when she felt comfortable, maybe it's not a lie. But the fact that she had to explain it in a specific way after he found out might make him feel lied to. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether not disclosing a past marriage is considered a lie. Since she was not currently married, but had a past marriage, it's a matter of how Jake perceived it. If he felt the need to know about any past marriages for trust reasons, then her omission could be seen as a problem. However, if she was planning to inform him when the time was right, maybe it's not a lie. \n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is B (she's not in the wrong). But I'm still a bit torn. The user's friend thought she was in the wrong, but maybe the key is that she was honest once found out and intended to be honest. So perhaps B is correct.\n"
