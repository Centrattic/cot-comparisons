We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not telling her boyfriend, Jake, that she was married when they started dating.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The author married Henry to help him stay in the country. They broke up but stayed friends, and she kept the marriage to help him with his papers. Later, she met Jake online, started dating, and planned to tell him in person. Before she could, Jake did a background check and found out. She then explained the situation to him, but he's been acting like she lied, invading her privacy, etc.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not disclosing her previous marriage earlier. Let's consider the ethical aspects. When someone is in a relationship, especially one that's progressing to a point where they might meet in person, there's an expectation of honesty. However, the author didn't hide the fact that she was married; she just planned to discuss it in person. The issue is whether withholding such significant information for a few months is a lie or a withholding of information.\n\nIn many relationships, major life details like past marriages are considered important to share. The author had a valid reason for not wanting to discuss it early on\u2014she was avoiding oversharing online. But she did intend to tell him eventually. However, Jake's discovery through a background check complicates things. Did she have a responsibility to disclose this sooner, especially if he did a background check and found out, leading to trust issues?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if she had been legally married during the relationship, there could be issues, but in this case, she was divorced. The problem here is more about honesty and trust. The author's decision to wait to tell him in person might be seen as not being upfront, even if her intentions were good. On the other hand, Jake's reaction\u2014using a background check and then not trusting her\u2014might also be a problem. He could have asked her directly instead of prying.\n\nBut the core of the question is whether the author lied. She didn't lie; she simply didn't disclose the information until after he found out. However, the term \"lied\" might be an overstatement. The real issue is whether withholding such information for a significant period is acceptable. In relationships, transparency is key. Even if the author had a plan to tell him, the fact that she didn't disclose it when asked or when it was relevant might be seen as a lack of full honesty.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong for not telling him immediately, especially since she planned to disclose it in person. However, Jake's actions (privacy invasion, not trusting her) are problematic. The author's decision to wait might not be a lie but could be seen as withholding information, which might affect trust. But given the context and her intention to tell him eventually, it's a nuanced situation. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's withholding is considered a lie. Since she didn't directly lie but omitted information, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for interpretation.\n"
