We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their current boyfriend (Jake) about their previous marriage to Henry. \n\nFirst, the user married Henry to help him get a visa, and they stayed married to allow him to stay in the country. After they broke up, the user didn't divorce Henry immediately because they promised his family. Then, when dating Jake, the user didn't disclose the marriage upfront but planned to tell him in person after buying a ticket to meet. However, Jake did a background check and found out before the user could tell him. \n\nThe key points here are the reasons for not disclosing and the timing. The user had a valid reason for the marriage and kept her promise to Henry's family. When it came to Jake, she wasn't lying; she just delayed the information because she felt it was more appropriate to share in person. The user didn't hide the fact intentionally; she planned to tell him when they met. \n\nJake's reaction is about trust issues because he found out through a background check. The user didn't lie directly, but the timing of disclosure might be a point of contention. However, the user's intention was honest, and the situation was complex. \n\nIs the user at fault? They didn't withhold the information maliciously. They had a good reason for the marriage and intended to be upfront. So, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
