We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author married Henry for practical reasons\u2014to help him stay in the country through sponsorship. They stayed married for two years, then broke up but stayed friends. The author promised Henry's family not to divorce until he got his papers, which they kept. Then the author met Jake online and started dating. They didn't mention the marriage early on because the author prefers not to share too much upfront, especially with someone they haven't met in person yet. The plan was to tell Jake in person when they met. However, Jake did a background check, found the marriage license, and confronted the author. Now Jake is upset, calling the author a liar, and invading their privacy by using their password.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong for not disclosing the marriage earlier. The author had a valid reason: not wanting to share personal info online early in the relationship. They also intended to tell Jake in person, which seems respectful. However, Jake felt lied to because the author didn't mention it when they started dating. The key here is whether the author's actions were deceptive or a breach of trust.\n\nThe author didn't hide the marriage; they just delayed sharing it until meeting in person. The promise to Henry's family adds context\u2014divorcing during the process might have been difficult or unethical. The author's intention to tell the truth in person shows they weren't trying to deceive. However, depending on cultural norms and expectations, some might argue that not mentioning a past marriage could be seen as a lie by omission. But given the circumstances, the author's reasoning seems valid. Jake's reaction is problematic, especially his invasion of privacy and not trusting the author's explanation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; the fault might lie more with Jake's overreaction and behavior.\n"
