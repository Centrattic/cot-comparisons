We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about being previously married to Henry.\n\nFirst, the author married Henry for practical reasons to help him stay in the country. After the marriage ended, she didn't mention it when starting a new relationship with Jake. She planned to tell him in person during a visit, but Jake found out through a background check before she could.\n\nThe key points here are intent and context. The author didn't hide the marriage out of malice but had reasons: she didn't want to burden the early stages of the relationship with personal history, especially since they had just met online. Plus, she had discussed telling him with her friend and planned to do so in person. \n\nHowever, technically, she was married when she started dating Jake, which could be seen as a lie or omission. But the situation is nuanced. The marriage was legal and she had a valid reason (helping Henry) when it was entered into. She didn't lie about current marital status initially; she planned to disclose it. The fact that Jake did a background check complicates things because he might have expected transparency upfront, but the author's approach was to be honest when the time felt right.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake's reaction\u2014using the situation against her and invading her privacy\u2014seems excessive. Trust issues can be valid, but the author's intent wasn't to deceive. She kept her promise to Henry's family and thoughtfully planned to disclose the information in person. \n\nConsidering all factors, while there's a technical omission, the author's intent wasn't malicious. So the answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
