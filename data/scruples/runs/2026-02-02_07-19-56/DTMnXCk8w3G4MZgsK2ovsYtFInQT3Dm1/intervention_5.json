We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that she married Henry when he was on an internship and they were living together. She stayed married to help him get his papers, then broke up. Later, she starts dating Jake online but doesn't tell him about the marriage until after he did a background check. Now, Jake is upset because he thinks she lied by not telling him earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If she was legally married, then during the time she was married to Henry, she was legally not allowed to marry someone else. However, since she and Henry are divorced, she's now free to marry. But when she started dating Jake, she was already divorced, right? Wait, the timeline here is a bit important. She married Henry, then broke up but stayed married until Henry got his papers. Then after a year, she meets Jake. The marriage to Henry ended before she started dating Jake? Or was she still married when she started the relationship with Jake?\n\nWait, the key point is when the marriage to Henry ended. She says she broke up with Henry two years after they married. Then a year after the breakup, she met Jake. So, if the breakup happened two years after marriage, and assuming they got a divorce after that, she would have been divorced when she started dating Jake. So she was single when she met Jake. But she didn't mention the marriage because she didn't think it was relevant until they met in person. However, if she was still legally married when she started dating Jake, that would be a problem. But according to the timeline given, she broke up with Henry and got divorced before meeting Jake. So she was divorced when she started the relationship with Jake. Therefore, she wasn't married at the time of the new relationship.\n\nNow, the issue is about honesty. She didn't tell Jake about her past marriage until after he found out through a background check. She planned to tell him in person. But Jake felt that she lied because she didn't disclose it when they were in the early stages online. The question is whether she was wrong for not telling him earlier.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. However, past marriages can be considered personal information. She didn't misrepresent her marital status at the time; she was not married when she started dating Jake. She was divorced. So, she wasn't lying about being married at the time of the new relationship. However, not disclosing the past marriage could be seen as a withholding of information, especially if the new partner wanted to know about her past. \n\nBut in many cases, people don't expect someone to reveal their entire life history immediately. It's common to share personal information gradually as trust builds. She planned to tell him in person, which she did. The problem arises because Jake felt betrayed that she didn't tell him before he found out through a background check. He might have felt that such information should be shared earlier. However, if she was not currently married and had no legal obligations to Henry anymore, then she wasn't in the wrong for not disclosing it immediately. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that she had discussed with her best friend and planned to tell him in person shows her intention to be honest, which could mitigate the situation. However, Jake's invasion of privacy and her giving him her password is another issue. But the core question is about her not telling him about the past marriage. \n\nIn conclusion, if she was divorced and not currently married, then she wasn't in the wrong for not disclosing her past marriage immediately. However, if she had ongoing legal or marital status that was still active when she started the new relationship, that would be different. Since the timeline indicates she was divorced, she wasn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
