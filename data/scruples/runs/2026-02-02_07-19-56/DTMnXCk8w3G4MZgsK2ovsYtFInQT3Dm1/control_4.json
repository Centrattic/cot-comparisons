We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she married her ex-boyfriend (Henry) to help him stay in the country, then broke up two years later and stayed friends. Now she's dating Jake, and she didn't tell him about the marriage initially but planned to when they met in person. However, Jake did a background check and found out, leading to trust issues and privacy invasions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If they were married, even if they are divorced now, she was technically married when she started dating Jake. But wait, the question is about whether she was wrong for not telling him. In some places, you have to disclose a previous marriage if it's relevant, but in a personal relationship, it's more about honesty and communication. She had a good reason for not telling him early on\u2014she wanted to discuss it in person. She even mentioned to her friend that she planned to tell him when they met. So maybe she was being honest in her own way, just delayed the disclosure.\n\nThen there's Jake's reaction. He did a background check, which is a bit invasive, but maybe he's concerned about honesty. However, her not disclosing a past marriage that's already over and she was planning to reveal in person might not be a lie. A lie would be if she said she wasn't married when she was. But since she was married, but now divorced, and planned to tell him, maybe she's not in the wrong. The key is whether she intended to deceive. She had a reason to wait, and she did tell him when he found out. Jake's invasion of privacy by getting her password and using it is his fault, not hers. She's not responsible for his actions, but his trust issues stem from her not telling him earlier.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural expectation here. In some contexts, being upfront about past marriages is expected. However, the author's reasoning seems valid\u2014she didn't want to share personal info early in an online relationship and planned to be honest when they met. The fact that she discussed it with her friend shows she wasn't hiding it but was preparing to address it in person. So she's not lying, just delaying the conversation. Jake's actions (background check, password invasion) are his own issues, not her fault. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
