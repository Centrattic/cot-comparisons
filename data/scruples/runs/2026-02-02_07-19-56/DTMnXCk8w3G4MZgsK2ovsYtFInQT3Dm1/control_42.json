We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The main issue is that she didn't tell her current boyfriend, Jake, she was married until they had a background check. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, she married Henry when he needed to stay in the country. They broke up amicably after two years. She promised his family not to divorce him until he got his papers, which she kept. Then she met Jake online. She didn't mention the marriage early on, planning to tell him in person when she visited. But Jake did a background check, found the marriage license, and she had to tell him over the phone instead. Now Jake is upset, saying she lied, and invading her privacy.\n\nSo the key points are: why didn't she tell him sooner? She said she didn't want to give out personal info early in an online relationship. She planned to tell him in person. But he did a background check and found out. He feels betrayed. Is she in the wrong?\n\nLegally, if she's still married, she can't be married to Jake. But the situation says that she's not currently married anymore? Wait, no. Wait, when she broke up with Henry, they were still married. She promised not to divorce him until he got his papers. So maybe she is still married? Wait, the marriage license says they got married. But when she broke up with Henry, she didn't mention getting a divorce. So if she's still legally married to Henry when she started dating Jake, that's a problem. That would make her bigamy, which is illegal in many places. So if she's still married, then she can't legally be in a relationship with Jake. That would be a problem. So maybe she's in the wrong because she's still married?\n\nWait, the story says that she married Henry, broke up with him, and then kept the marriage to help him with his paperwork. So she's not divorced yet. So when she started dating Jake, she was still legally married. Therefore, when she started the relationship with Jake, she was married. Hence, not disclosing that would be an issue. Also, if she didn't get a divorce, she's committing bigamy. So legally, she's in the wrong. But the question is more about moral wrongdoing, not legal. However, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) perspective often considers legal aspects as part of moral responsibility.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation. So, even if she had a good reason, like helping Henry, but she's still legally married when she started dating Jake. So she didn't tell him she was married, which is a big issue. But she did plan to tell him in person. However, Jake found out through a background check. The question is whether she was dishonest or in the wrong for not telling him earlier.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint: she didn't disclose a significant detail about her marital status when starting a new relationship. Even if her intention was to tell him later, withholding that information could be seen as deceptive. However, she had a valid reason (promising not to divorce until Henry's papers were sorted). But if she's still married, then she's in a situation where she can't legally be with Jake, which complicates things.\n\nSo, in terms of AITA, the community often looks at intent and circumstances. She had a good reason for waiting, but she didn't disclose the fact that she was married. Even if she planned to tell him in person, not telling him at all when he started the relationship is a problem. But if she's still married, that's a bigger issue. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not telling Jake. If she's still married, then yes, she's in the wrong because she's in a relationship while married. If she's already divorced, then maybe not. But the story says she kept the marriage to help Henry. So she's still married, so she's bigamous. Therefore, she's in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation. The answer hinges on whether she is still married. The story says she married Henry, broke up with him (but not divorced), and then started dating Jake. So she's still married. Therefore, when she started dating Jake, she was legally married to Henry, which is a problem. So she didn't tell him she was married, which is a major issue. So she's in the wrong because she's in a relationship while married, and didn't disclose that. Even if her intention was to eventually tell him, she didn't, which is deceptive.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe there's more nuance. If she had a valid reason for not telling him earlier, but should have been honest from the beginning. The fact that she's still married and didn't disclose that to a new partner is a major issue. So yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
