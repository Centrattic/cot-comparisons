We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she married Henry to help him stay in the country, then they broke up but she stayed married to help him get his papers. Then she started dating Jake online and didn't tell him about the marriage until she was going to meet him in person. Jake did a background check and found out, and now he's upset because she didn't tell him sooner, leading to trust issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she didn't tell him. She mentioned that she's private and didn't want to share personal info early in the relationship, especially with someone she hadn't met yet. She planned to tell him in person after buying a ticket to visit him. She even discussed this plan with her best friend. That seems like she had good intentions and planned to be honest when the time was right.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake might feel that not disclosing such a significant detail as a previous marriage is a major omission, especially since he did a background check and found out. The fact that he had her password and invaded her privacy is another issue, but he's using her withholding the marriage as a justification for not trusting her. \n\nMarriage is a big deal, so withholding that information could be seen as a lie or at least a major omission. However, the context matters. She didn't lie; she just didn't disclose it yet. She intended to tell him in person, which is a reasonable approach. The problem is that Jake felt it was a lie, even though she had no malicious intent. \n\nBut then again, in a relationship, especially when things get serious, certain information becomes relevant. If Jake had a background check done, that's a proactive step, which might indicate he was being cautious. However, expecting someone to volunteer such personal information before meeting in person might be unrealistic. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She didn't lie, just withheld information, planning to reveal it in person. Jake's reaction might stem from mistrust, but invading her privacy is his own fault. The key here is intent. She didn't deceive him with malicious intent; she just wanted to be honest when she felt it was appropriate. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Her actions were honest, even if the timing wasn't to Jake's liking. Jake's privacy invasion is his responsibility, not hers.\n"
