We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about being previously married. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: She married Henry to help him stay in the country, then they broke up but she stayed married until he got his papers. Then she started dating Jake online. She didn't mention the marriage initially because she didn't want to share too much early on. She planned to tell him in person when she visited. But Jake did a background check, found out, and now he's upset, accusing her of lying.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's consider the key points. Was she being deceptive? She didn't intentionally lie; she just didn't disclose the information early. She had a valid reason for waiting\u2014she wanted to discuss it in person. However, when asked directly, she did provide the truth.\n\nBut in a relationship, honesty is crucial. Even if she had a reason to wait, not telling a significant fact like a previous marriage could be seen as withholding information. Especially if the boyfriend felt it was important enough to do a background check. His reaction might be extreme, but her not disclosing it could still be a mistake in terms of transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, she wasn't hiding it maliciously. She had a plan to reveal it in person and even discussed it with her friend. The fact that she eventually told him shows she wasn't lying. The issue is the timing and the method of disclosure.\n\nIn relationships, full disclosure is expected, especially when there are legal documents involved. A previous marriage could affect the current relationship in terms of legal status, which is a big deal. So even if her intention was good, not being upfront might be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was married and then divorced is a significant life detail. If the boyfriend had concerns about that, it's reasonable for him to feel hurt. However, his invasion of privacy (using her password) is also problematic and not justified by her actions.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: The author's intent wasn't to deceive, but the act of not disclosing such a significant fact without a clear reason (other than personal preference) might be considered withholding information. Therefore, she could be in the wrong for not being transparent enough. But maybe not completely, because she had a plan to tell him in person. It's a bit of a gray area. However, in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers intent and context. Since she didn't lie but withheld info, it's a judgment call. Some might say she's not the asshole because she wasn't deceptive, others might say she should have been more honest earlier. I think leaning towards her not being in the wrong because she had a good reason and did tell him before meeting in person. So answer B.\n"
