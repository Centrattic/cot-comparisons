We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person who wrote the post (AITA) is a woman who married a guy (Henry) for immigration reasons. They broke up after two years, but she stayed married to help him get his papers. Then she started dating someone new online (Jake). She didn't tell him about the marriage until after he did a background check and found out. Now Jake is upset that she didn't tell him upfront and accuses her of lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she was obligated to disclose her marital status earlier. When they were in the early stages of the relationship, she didn't meet him in person and wasn't comfortable sharing that info yet. She planned to tell him in person, which she did discuss with her friend. But Jake did a background check and found out before she could tell him. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but there's also a consideration of timing and context. She wasn't lying; she just delayed the information. However, withholding such a significant detail, even if with good intentions, can be problematic. Especially in a new relationship where trust is crucial. Jake's reaction is about trust, which is valid because marriage is a major life fact that affects the relationship's foundation. \n\nBut she had a reason for waiting\u2014she wanted to share it in person. However, Jake's perspective is that she didn't disclose it when he asked for information. The fact that he did a background check suggests he might have been looking for issues, which complicates things. \n\nLegally, if they were in a country where bigamy is illegal, being married could be an issue. But the scenario doesn't mention that. Ethically, she was hiding a past marriage, which might not be a lie if she never said she was single. But in terms of honesty in relationships, people usually expect to know about past marriages early on. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She didn't lie, but she withheld information. Depending on cultural norms and the expectations in their relationship, this could be seen as a breach of trust. Jake's invasion of privacy might be a separate issue, but his anger stems from her not disclosing. \n\nIn conclusion, while her intentions were to be honest when the time felt right, withholding such significant information can be seen as deceptive, even if not technically a lie. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
