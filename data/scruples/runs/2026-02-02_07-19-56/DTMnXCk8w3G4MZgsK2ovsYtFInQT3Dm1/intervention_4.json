We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The situation is that she was married to Henry, got a divorce, then started dating Jake. She didn't tell him about her past marriage until he found out through a background check. Now Jake is upset and accuses her of lying. The user initially thinks she's in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She didn't disclose her past marriage early in the relationship with Jake. She planned to tell him in person but he found out first. She had a good reason, not wanting to share too much early on, especially since he was a stranger online. Also, she kept her promise to Henry's family by waiting until he had his papers before divorcing him, which shows she had a valid reason for keeping it private longer.\n\nOn the other hand, when someone asks about your past, like a background check, they might expect transparency. However, in many relationships, especially new ones, people often don't share their entire history upfront. The issue is trust. Jake felt betrayed because he found out through a background check, which might make him feel like she was hiding something. But she had a reason for waiting, and she did tell him before meeting in person, which she thought was more appropriate.\n\nI think the main point is whether withholding information about a past marriage is deceptive. Since she wasn't currently married anymore, and she intended to tell him when they met, it's not a lie. She just delayed sharing. However, depending on cultural or personal expectations, some might see it as a breach of trust. But legally, she wasn't hiding anything illegal. Emotionally, Jake's reaction is valid, but she isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
