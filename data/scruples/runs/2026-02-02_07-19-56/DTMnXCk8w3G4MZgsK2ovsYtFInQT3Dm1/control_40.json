We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author married someone (Henry) to help him stay in the country, then broke up but stayed married for his legal status. Later, she starts dating Jake but doesn't tell him about the marriage initially, planning to do so in person. However, Jake does a background check and finds out, leading to trust issues.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if not telling Jake about the marriage was a lie or a withholding of information. The author didn't lie; she didn't mention it when they were communicating online. However, she did intend to tell him in person. The key here is whether she was being deceptive. She didn't actively lie but omitted the information. \n\nMarriage is a significant life event, so withholding it could be seen as a lack of transparency. But considering her reasons\u2014planning to disclose in person and not feeling comfortable sharing personal details early on\u2014there's context. However, once a relationship progresses, especially when meeting in person, such a major detail should be shared to build trust. \n\nJake's reaction is about trust because he felt lied to. The author's stance is that she had a plan to disclose but didn't follow through before he found out. The question is whether her intention to tell him in person absolves her of the responsibility to be honest earlier. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Even if the author had good intentions, not disclosing such a significant fact before a background check led to the issue. The fact that she discussed it with her friend but not Jake suggests she was preparing to tell but didn't take the step before he found out. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not being upfront, even if her intention was to tell him in person. The expectation in a relationship is that major life events like a previous marriage should be disclosed, especially when legal documents are involved. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
