We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their boyfriend they're married. They were married before to someone they were in a relationship with, and they broke up but stayed married to help the ex get his papers. Now, they started dating someone new, Jake, online and didn't mention the marriage until after he did a background check.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were married for a reason\u2014helping the ex stay in the country. They stayed married even after the breakup, which shows they kept their word. When starting a new relationship, they didn't want to share personal info too early, especially since they hadn't met in person. They planned to tell him in person, which is a reasonable approach. However, they didn't tell him immediately once they met, and instead waited until he found out through a background check.\n\nThe key issue here is transparency. In a relationship, honesty is crucial. Even if they had good intentions for not disclosing upfront, withholding important information like a previous marriage can be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend feels violated because he discovered it through a background check, which suggests he felt the need to investigate due to lack of information. The author's justification is that they didn't want to share personal details online early on, which makes sense, but a marriage is a significant part of someone's life and should be shared when the relationship progresses to that level.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be harsh, but the fact that the author didn't disclose the marriage even after planning to meet in person could be seen as a decision to withhold information that's important for a trusting relationship. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's a case to be made that they should have shared this information sooner once they were in a more committed stage. The boyfriend's invasion of privacy is a separate issue, but the author's actions might have contributed to the trust issues.\n"
