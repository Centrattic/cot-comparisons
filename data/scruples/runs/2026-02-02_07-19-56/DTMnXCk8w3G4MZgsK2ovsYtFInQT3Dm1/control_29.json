We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her past marriage before they met in person.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. She married Henry to help him stay in the country, then broke up two years later. She didn't divorce him until he got his papers. Now she's dating Jake, and didn't mention the marriage until after he did a background check and found out. She planned to tell him in person, even talked to her best friend about it before buying the ticket to meet him. But Jake is upset because he feels she lied by not disclosing this earlier, leading to trust issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are: She didn't lie intentionally. She intended to tell him when they met. He found out through a background check, which he initiated. She had a valid reason to wait\u2014planning to disclose it in person. However, not being upfront about a past marriage might be seen as a red flag, depending on how the information is presented. But she didn't hide it; she just delayed disclosure until an in-person meeting. \n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. Is withholding a past marriage a lie? If she was honest when he asked, but didn't volunteer the information until prompted by his background check, maybe she didn't lie. However, some might argue that in a new relationship, being up-front about significant life events like a past marriage is important. She had the intention to be honest, just delayed it for practical reasons. \n\nJake's reaction is about trust. He might feel that any delay in disclosure is a deception, but she had a specific reason (planning to tell him in person) and had even discussed it with a friend. The fact that she called her friend for advice shows she was considering the right time to tell him. \n\nSo, the question is whether her actions constitute a lie. If she didn't actively conceal it but intended to disclose it later, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, others might say that not being transparent from the start is problematic. But given her reasoning and the fact that she was going to tell him in person, I think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
