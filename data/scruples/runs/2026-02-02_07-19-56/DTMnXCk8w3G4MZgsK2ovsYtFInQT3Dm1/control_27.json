We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not telling her current boyfriend, Jake, about her previous marriage before a background check revealed it. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author married Henry when he needed a way to stay in the country, later broke up amicably, and kept the marriage for his immigration status. When starting a relationship with Jake, she didn't mention the marriage initially because she met him online and didn't want to overshare early on. She planned to tell him in person during a planned visit. However, Jake did a background check and found out, leading to trust issues and privacy invasions from Jake.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's consider the ethics of withholding such information. Marriage is a significant aspect of someone's life, and honesty is important in relationships. However, the context matters. She had valid reasons for not disclosing upfront: she was in a different country, met him online, and had plans to talk in person. Her intentions were honest, and she was about to reveal the truth soon. The fact that she told her best friend about her plan shows she wasn't trying to deceive. \n\nOn the other hand, Jake's reaction of invading her privacy (using her password) is problematic. Trust is crucial, but his response seems excessive. The question is whether withholding the marriage information until a planned in-person meeting was dishonest. Since she had no intention to lie and was going to disclose it, she's not in the wrong. The real issue here is Jake's lack of trust and his inappropriate actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
