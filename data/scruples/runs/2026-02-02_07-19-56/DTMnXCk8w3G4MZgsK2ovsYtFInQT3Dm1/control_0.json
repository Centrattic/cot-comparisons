We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is at fault for not telling her boyfriend, Jake, that she was married until she met him in person.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author married Henry for immigration reasons, stayed married to help him get papers, and later broke up. When she started dating Jake online, she didn't mention the marriage initially, planning to tell him in person. Jake did a background check, found the marriage license, and now accuses her of lying. She argues that she intended to tell him in person and had discussed it with her friend before meeting.\n\nNow, considering ethical and relational expectations. In most relationships, honesty is crucial, especially about past marriages. However, the context matters here. The author married Henry for practical reasons unrelated to their love story. She kept her word to not divorce him for his immigration status, which shows she was responsible. When starting a new relationship with Jake, she wanted to share this information face-to-face, which is a considerate approach. However, she didn't disclose it immediately, which could be seen as withholding information.\n\nBut Jake did a background check, which is a bit invasive. The author didn't lie; she just delayed the disclosure. The issue is whether withholding such important info for a few months is a lie or just a delay in sharing. Since she planned to tell him in person and had even discussed it with a friend, her intention was honest. Jake's reaction about not trusting her because of this is problematic, especially since he found out through a background check, which isn't a typical way someone would discover this. \n\nLegally, if the marriage is dissolved, she's not technically lying. Ethically, transparency is important, but the method of disclosure matters. Since she intended to tell him and didn't hide it when she met him, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) community might side with her, considering the intent and the fact that Jake's actions (using her password, invading privacy) are more concerning. So, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
