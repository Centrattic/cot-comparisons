We fell in love pretty quickly and had an awesome relationship. The guy he was interning for said he he did so well that he would try and sponsor him. Months pass and his boss kept putting it off. Eventually, he says he can\u2019t sponsor him bc it\u2019s too expensive. At this point we were living together and he was making more money than I was at the time bc I was in college. Anyway, we figure out the only way for him to stay at this point is for us to get married. So we do. Two years later I break up with him (we\u2019re still good friends) because of his immaturity at times and other non serious things. When we got married I promised his family (who I grew very close to when they would visit) that even if we broke up I wouldn\u2019t fuck him over by divorcing him until he got his papers. I kept my word. \n\nA year after the break up, I meet a guy online and we start dating we\u2019ll call him Jake. Now I\u2019m the type of person who doesn\u2019t like to give out too much information early on in the relationship, especially to someone I have never met in person so I don\u2019t bring up the marriage yet. So after dating for a couple of months we agree to meet. I plan to fly over there and visit for a couple of weeks. I decide I\u2019m going to fill him in on the marriage situation in person because I think that\u2019s more appropriate. I call my best friend after I buy my ticket and ask her for advice on how to tell him. \n\nThe next week my new bf calls me and tells me he did a background check on me and saw a marriage license. So I fill him in over the phone bc at that point I have to. I tell him that I planned on telling him in person and that I had even discussed it with my best friend a few days ago. He\u2019s pretty chill about it at that time. We stay together. \n\nThe problem is that ever since then there were several occasions where he  invaded my privacy. He had my password for one thing and used it to get into something else. He says that he can never trust me because I \u201clied about being married.\u201d I explained to him many times why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable throwing that out there online and that I planned on telling him in person. He still uses it against me and says I\u2019m a liar. Is he right? AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their boyfriend, Jake, about being previously married. They met Henry, married for immigration reasons, stayed married to help Henry, then broke up but stayed married. Then they met Jake online and didn't mention the marriage until after Jake did a background check.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong for not disclosing the marriage upfront. Let's consider the context. The author had a legal marriage that was necessary for Henry's visa. They decided to end the relationship but kept the marriage for his sake. When entering a new relationship with Jake, they were cautious because they met online and didn't want to share too much early. They intended to tell him in person after meeting. However, Jake found out through a background check and now feels betrayed, even though the author had plans to disclose it.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because they were married, and the marriage was real. The issue is more about trust and honesty in the relationship. The author had a valid reason to wait until meeting in person to explain, given the complexity and potential misunderstanding. Jake's invasion of privacy (getting passwords) is another issue. The author's actions might not be malicious but a decision based on their judgment of when to disclose sensitive information.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in a relationship, especially when planning to meet in person, disclosing a past marriage is important early on. But since the marriage was still active and legally binding, the author couldn't have ended it until Henry's papers were sorted. So withholding that info was necessary and ethical.\n\nJake's reaction seems to stem from feeling lied to, but the author didn't lie; they omitted information until a more appropriate time. The key is intent. If the author had plans to tell him, it's not a lie. So the answer might be B (they are not in the wrong).\n"
