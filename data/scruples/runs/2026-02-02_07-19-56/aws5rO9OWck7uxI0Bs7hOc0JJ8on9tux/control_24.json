I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the person is asking if they're at fault for wanting their wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when they're present. The user speaks multiple languages but doesn't know French. The wife's parents only speak French, and the wife is upset that the husband is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural sensitivity. The wife's family has their own language, which is part of their heritage. It's common for families to speak their native language among themselves, even in multicultural relationships. The husband feels left out because he can't understand the conversations, but that's different from being disrespectful to the family.\n\nThe husband did ask his wife to have them speak English, but the wife's parents aren't comfortable with that. The husband then suggested not coming to dinner if they can't speak English, which the wife found irritating. He felt it was unfair to be in a situation where he can't participate in the conversation. \n\nHowever, the wife points out that not attending would be disrespectful to her parents. There's a balance between the husband's comfort and respecting the wife's family's traditions. The husband's approach might have been abrupt\u2014maybe he didn't consider other solutions, like learning some French or engaging in the dinner in other ways. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The husband isn't wrong for feeling excluded, but his solution might have been too extreme. The wife's parents' language use isn't inherently disrespectful; it's a cultural practice. The husband could have approached the situation with more patience, perhaps discussing it with the wife first to find a compromise rather than threatening to not attend. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but his approach could have been better. However, based on the options given (A for yes, B for no), the best choice is B, because the husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his feelings, though he could improve his method.\n"
