I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author had an argument with their wife about her family speaking French during dinner, which he doesn't understand. He felt left out and asked to not come to these dinners if they can't speak English. The wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English and that he should attend anyway. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he feels excluded and doesn't understand what's happening when the family speaks French. It's understandable to feel left out in a social setting where you can't participate. His request to not attend if they can't switch to a language he knows is about his comfort and inclusion. However, he did approach it in a way that might come off as abrupt, especially if he was \"kinda ticked off\" when bringing it up. Maybe a more calm approach would have been better, as he acknowledges.\n\nOn the wife's side, her parents might be more comfortable in French, which is their native language. Cultural and family dynamics often prioritize using the native language at home, especially among family members. The wife's argument is that it's disrespectful not to attend, which is a valid point in terms of social expectations. But at the same time, the husband's feelings of exclusion are real and important in a relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for expressing his discomfort? Well, communication is key in relationships. The husband did express his feelings, but maybe not in the most constructive way. The wife's reaction might have been due to feeling that her family's needs or comfort were being dismissed. The husband's request to not attend might be seen as avoiding the situation rather than trying to find a compromise. However, he's under no obligation to be in a situation where he can't participate or understand the conversation.\n\nSo, considering mutual respect and understanding, perhaps the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The wife might need to find a way to include him more in the conversation, like translating or switching to English when he's present. But the husband could have approached it more calmly and perhaps discussed possible solutions together. The key is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since he's part of the family now, expecting some level of accommodation (like some English) isn't unreasonable. However, the wife's parents might not be able to switch, so maybe the husband needs to find a middle ground, like learning some French or the wife acting as a translator. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The main issue is that he expressed his discomfort, which is valid, but the way he did it might have been harsh. However, he also stated he doesn't have to be in that situation, which is his right. So maybe he isn't in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The wife's perspective is about respecting her parents, but the husband's feelings matter too. It's a balance. He's not being selfish for wanting to understand the conversation he's part of. So I think the answer is B.\n"
