I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author asking their wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinner, which he doesn't understand. The wife says her parents aren't comfortable with English, and the author feels it's unfair to be in that situation. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The author is married to a woman whose family speaks French. He's comfortable with multiple languages, but not French. During family dinners, they only speak French except for the initial introductions. The author felt left out and asked not to attend if he can't understand the conversation, which led to conflict with his wife. The wife argues that her parents aren't comfortable in English and that it's disrespectful not to attend. The author is frustrated because he feels he shouldn't have to be in that situation, even though he might have been a bit harsh in his tone.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's right to feel included in his wife's family, the wife's family's language preference, and the expectations in cross-cultural marriages. \n\nOn one hand, the author is in a position where he's part of the family through marriage, and it's reasonable for him to want to participate in conversations. However, he married into a family with different cultural and linguistic norms. The wife's family isn't obligated to switch languages if they're uncomfortable. The author could have approached the situation by learning French or engaging in other ways during the meal, like asking questions or making small talk in English. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is valid. Being left out of the main conversation can be isolating. But he did have the option to either learn the language or accept that some interactions would be in French. The wife's stance that her parents aren't comfortable with English is a cultural factor to consider. In many cultures, families prioritize their native language, especially with relatives. The author's request to not attend if he can't understand might be seen as avoiding the situation rather than trying to bridge the gap. \n\nThe author's tone might have been better, but the core issue is whether his expectations are reasonable. He's not asking the family to switch languages but to not speak it in his presence, which might not be fair. The wife's parents have the right to use their preferred language, and the wife might feel that her family's comfort is important. The author could be seen as not making an effort to integrate into the family's culture, which is part of being a spouse. \n\nHowever, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his feelings. He has a right to feel included, but his approach might not be the best. The wife's response might be harsh, but the situation is complex. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and the couple's agreement. Since the author is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might lean towards no because he's not forcing the family to change, just expressing his discomfort. But some might argue he should have made more effort to adapt. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but the correct answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's advocating for his needs in the relationship, even if his method could be improved.\n"
