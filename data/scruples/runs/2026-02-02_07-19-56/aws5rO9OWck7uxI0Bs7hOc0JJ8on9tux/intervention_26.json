I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners. The author says they don't want to be the only one not understanding the conversation and felt excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and wife are bilingual, so the issue isn't about language suppression. The author attended dinner with the wife's parents, who only spoke French, making him feel left out. He asked to not attend if they can't speak English, which led to conflict.\n\nThe wife's side is that her parents aren't comfortable with English, so she's defending their language use. The author feels disrespected or excluded, but maybe he could have found another way to handle it. Is it selfish to want to understand the conversation? Or is it reasonable to feel included in family gatherings?\n\nIn intercultural marriages, communication styles can vary. The author's reaction might be seen as understandable, but his approach was direct and maybe abrupt. The wife felt he was being selfish, but the author's perspective is about inclusion. \n\nI should also consider cultural sensitivity. The parents might be more comfortable in French, and the wife might feel caught between two cultures. The author's request for English isn't about forcing a language but wanting to participate. However, he could have approached it more gently, like suggesting a compromise or learning some French.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. Being in a situation where you can't understand others can be stressful. However, expecting others to change their language for his comfort might be part of the issue. Maybe the author could have tried to learn basic French or engaged in other ways. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on balancing mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be included, but his approach could be better. The wife's parents have the right to their language, but maybe there's a middle ground. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong but could have handled it more diplomatically. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
