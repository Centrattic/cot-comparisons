I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife's family speaking French during dinner, which the author doesn't understand. The author asked to stop coming to dinners if he can't understand them, but his wife got upset, saying the parents aren't comfortable with English.\n\nFirst, the author says he doesn't want to make his wife speak any particular language, and they both know multiple languages. So it's not about forcing her to speak English. The problem is that during family dinners, they switch to French, which he can't understand, making him feel excluded.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling left out and not being able to participate in the conversation. He communicated his discomfort by suggesting he might not attend future dinners if he can't understand. The wife's response was that her parents aren't comfortable in English, so he should still come. The author feels that's unfair and thinks he shouldn't have to be in that situation.\n\nNow, considering cultural aspects. The wife's family is using their native language, which is common among immigrant families or bilingual families. It's a way to maintain their cultural identity and comfort. The author, however, wants to be included in the family interactions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing a valid concern about feeling excluded. However, he could have approached the situation differently. Maybe by talking to his wife first to find a compromise, like having some parts of the dinner in English or learning basic French to ease into it. Instead, he decided to threaten to stop attending unless they change, which might come off as ultimatum-like. \n\nThe wife's parents might not be comfortable switching to English, which is their right. The author's request to not come if they can't speak English is understandable but perhaps abrupt. The wife's irritation might be because she feels he's not respecting her family's language preference. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? Maybe partially. He could have been more understanding and tried to bridge the gap rather than making a demand. However, his feelings of exclusion are valid. The wife could have explained the family's situation more sensitively and maybe worked on solutions. \n\nIn the end, it's a mutual understanding issue. The author's approach might have been too direct, but his feelings aren't entirely invalid. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider the cultural aspect and could have communicated better. But I'm a bit torn. Maybe B (not in the wrong) because he's justified in wanting to be included. Need to weigh cultural sensitivity vs. personal feelings.\n"
