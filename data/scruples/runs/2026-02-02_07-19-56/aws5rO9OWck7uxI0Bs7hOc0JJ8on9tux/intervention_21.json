After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is married to someone who speaks multiple languages, including French. The author doesn't know French. The wife's parents, when they have dinner together, mostly speak French, which leaves the author confused and feeling excluded. The author then asks to not attend these dinners if they can't understand the conversation or at least have it in English. The wife gets irritated, says her parents aren't comfortable in English, and the author feels like they're being selfish. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about language use in a multicultural family setting. The author isn't asking the wife to stop speaking French in general, just when he's present. But the wife's parents are the ones who are using French during the meal. The author's complaint is about feeling excluded and not being able to participate in the conversation. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some families, especially multilingual ones, it's common to use the heritage language among family members. The parents might feel more comfortable in French, which is their native language. The author's request to have some English at the table could be seen as a way to include him, but the wife is defending her parents' right to use their preferred language. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Well, he's asking to be included in the conversation, which is a reasonable request. But at the same time, the wife's parents might not want to switch languages, which is their right. The author's reaction of wanting to not attend if they can't speak English might be seen as a bit extreme, but it's also about his comfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's response that it's disrespectful not to attend might be based on cultural expectations. In many cultures, meeting a spouse's parents is important, and refusing might be seen as rude. However, the author's discomfort is valid. They can't understand the conversation, which makes the dinner awkward. \n\nThe author's tone is a factor too. The wife said he was being selfish, and he acknowledges he could have been calmer. That might have affected how the request was received. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't forcing anyone to speak English, just asking for some consideration to include him. The wife's parents aren't obligated to switch languages, but the author's request for inclusion is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's trying to communicate his needs, which is important in a relationship. However, he could have approached it more gently. The wife might feel caught between her parents and her spouse, so her irritation is also understandable. \n\nThe answer probably isn't a clear A or B. But since the user is asking for a choice between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong), I have to decide. Considering that the author is expressing a valid concern about inclusion and isn't forcing language changes, I think he's not in the wrong. The wife and her parents might not be accommodating enough, but the author's request is reasonable. So the answer would be B.\n"
