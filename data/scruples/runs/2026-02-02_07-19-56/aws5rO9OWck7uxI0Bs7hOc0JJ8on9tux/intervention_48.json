I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife's family speaking French during dinners, which he can't understand. The author asked her to stop, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that he's excluded from conversations because they're in French, making him feel left out and confused. He asked to not attend if he can't understand, but the wife thinks it's disrespectful not to come. He's frustrated and maybe a bit selfish, as he's asking his wife to change her family's language use. But then again, the wife's parents might prefer French and not be comfortable with English. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's true. The author has a right to feel included in family gatherings, but family dynamics and comfort with language are also important. The author could have approached it differently, maybe by trying to learn some French or engaging in other ways, but his request to not attend if he can't understand might be valid. The wife's response about it being disrespectful is a cultural norm. However, the author's tone was maybe off, he admitted that. \n\nSo, is it AITA? The author's perspective is about inclusion and understanding, but the wife's side is about family preferences. The author is not necessarily in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it better. The wife's parents' comfort is a factor. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings and requesting a solution. But some might say he's being selfish. It's a bit of a grey area. The user thinks A (wrong), but the assistant might lean towards B. I'll go with B.\n"
