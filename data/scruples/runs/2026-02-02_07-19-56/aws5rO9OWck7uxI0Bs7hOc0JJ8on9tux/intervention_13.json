I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author's wife and her French-speaking family. The author is upset because during dinner with her parents, they only spoke French, which he doesn't know. He felt left out and asked if he can skip these dinners if he can't understand them. The wife got irritated and said the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the dynamics here. The author's main issue is feeling excluded because he can't understand the language. He's not asking his wife to stop speaking French with her family, but he's uncomfortable being in a situation where he can't participate. On the other hand, the wife's family is using their own language, which is their right. The wife is caught in the middle between her family and her husband's feelings.\n\nThe author could have a valid point about feeling isolated, but maybe his approach was abrupt. He says he could have taken a calmer tone, which suggests he might have come off as confrontational. The wife's response that he's being selfish might be because he's asking to opt out of family time, which she perceives as avoiding a cultural or familial obligation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is within his rights to express discomfort about not understanding the conversation. However, the expectation that the family should switch languages for him might be where he's in the wrong. The family has the right to communicate in their preferred language, especially with family members. The author's request to not attend if he can't understand might be seen as a way to avoid the situation rather than finding a compromise, like learning some French or engaging in other ways.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's expressing his feelings, which is okay. The issue might be how he communicated it. If he had approached it with more empathy and discussed his feelings without making it an ultimatum (come or don't come), maybe the situation would be different. The wife's parents aren't obligated to switch to English, and the author's frustration is understandable, but his solution (opting out) could be seen as selfish because it's about his comfort rather than the family's.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because he's asking for something that's not feasible\u2014his wife's family switching languages. However, his feelings of exclusion are valid. The key might be in how he approached it. If he's being confrontational and making ultimatums, that's his fault. The wife's reaction could be defensiveness because of cultural ties. The author's request to not attend if he can't understand might be seen as selfish, hence the answer A.\n"
