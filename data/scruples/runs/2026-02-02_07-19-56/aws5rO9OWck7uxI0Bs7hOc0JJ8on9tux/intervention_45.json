I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author asked his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners, which he can't understand. He felt excluded and confused during their interaction and asked to not attend those dinners if English isn't used. The wife was irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English, and he got angry, thinking he doesn't have to be in that situation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective is about communication and inclusion. He can't understand French, so being in a room where everyone is speaking another language would be frustrating. He's asking for a solution that allows him to participate, which is reasonable. However, he did ask the wife to make her parents switch languages, which might be a stretch. Family dynamics can be complex, and parents might not be willing to change their language for a guest, especially if they're not comfortable with English.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's side is that her parents aren't comfortable with English, so expecting them to switch is unrealistic. She's in a tough spot between her husband's feelings and her parents' comfort. The husband's reaction of wanting to avoid the dinners might come off as dismissive of her family's traditions and her own relationship with them. His tone also might have been too harsh, leading to the wife feeling attacked.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the request to change the language of the family, the husband's frustration leading to wanting to skip dinners, and the wife's reaction. The husband's request is understandable, but imposing it on the wife's parents might be unreasonable. However, his desire to understand and be included is valid. The wife's position is that her parents can't switch languages, so the husband's demand for them to do so might be the issue here. The husband could have approached it differently, perhaps by trying to learn some French or having a private conversation with his wife to find a compromise without putting her in the middle. His frustration is justified, but his approach might have been too confrontational.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's mistake is in expecting the wife's parents to switch languages, which isn't feasible, and his reaction might have been too harsh. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But some might argue that his desire to be included is valid. The answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. Since the parents aren't comfortable with English, the author's request is not feasible, making him the AITA.\n"
