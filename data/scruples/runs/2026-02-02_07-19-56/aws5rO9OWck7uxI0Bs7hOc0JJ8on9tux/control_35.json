I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband asking his wife to stop her French-speaking parents from using French during dinners when he's present.\n\nFirst, the husband says he doesn't want to force his wife to speak any language, and they both know multiple languages. So it's not about language politics. The problem is that during dinner with her parents, they only speak French, which he doesn't understand. He felt excluded and asked to maybe not attend if he can't understand. The wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English, and he's being selfish.\n\nHmm. So the core issue is about communication and inclusion. The husband is a guest in his wife's parents' home. He's not part of the conversation, which might make him feel left out. But the wife's parents are using their native language, which is natural. The husband's request is about wanting to understand and participate, but the wife is defending her parents' language use.\n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, he's expressing a valid concern about feeling excluded. It's reasonable to want to understand the conversations at a dinner he's attending. However, the wife's parents might not be able to switch to English if they're not comfortable. The wife might need to act as a mediator here, but the husband is asking her to make that happen. Is that too much?\n\nThe wife's reaction is that he's being selfish. That could be valid if he's not considering the comfort of her parents. But the husband's feeling of exclusion is real. Maybe there's a middle ground, like the wife translating key parts or the parents slowing down when he's there. But the husband is asking for an all-or-nothing solution: either they switch to English or he doesn't come. That might be where the problem lies.\n\nSo, the husband's approach might be too rigid. Instead of demanding they switch to English, he could have asked for translation or for the wife to include him more. His tone was also \"kinda ticked off,\" which might have contributed to the wife's irritation. He could have handled it more calmly, but the request itself is understandable. The wife's parents' comfort is also a factor. So, is the husband in the wrong? Maybe partially, but not entirely. But according to the user's options, it's a yes or no.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether respecting the wife's family's language use is more important than the husband's comfort. Since the husband isn't forcing the wife to do anything and is just asking for inclusion, but the wife's parents can't switch, maybe the husband isn't wrong. He's not at fault for wanting to be included, but his approach could be better. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he's asking for a solution that might not be possible (parents not switching to English), maybe the answer is B. The wife's parents can't be forced to speak English, so the husband isn't wrong for expressing his feelings, even if the solution isn't feasible.\n"
