I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who's upset because their wife's family only speaks French during dinner, which he doesn't understand. He asked his wife to stop, but she got irritated and said her parents aren't comfortable with English. He then considered not attending those dinners but was told it's disrespectful not to show up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author isn't forcing his wife to speak a specific language, which he clarifies. They both speak multiple languages, so it's not about \"speaking American.\" The main issue is that during family dinners, the wife's parents use French, making him feel excluded and confused. He asked to either not attend or have some English spoken. The wife responded that her parents aren't comfortable in English, hence the continued use of French.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the wife and her parents have their own communication preferences. The author's request is understandable because he's in an environment where he can't participate, leading to discomfort. However, the wife's parents' comfort in their native language is also valid. The author's frustration is about being excluded, but the wife is caught between two sides.\n\nThe author's approach might have been better with a calmer tone, but the core issue is whether his request is unreasonable. On one hand, respecting the in-laws' language is important for the wife and her family. On the other, the author's feelings of being excluded are legitimate. The wife's response that he should still attend might be based on cultural expectations of respecting family. However, the author's right to feel included in his own family gatherings could also be valid. \n\nIn some cultures, language is deeply tied to identity and comfort, so the in-laws might not switch. The author might be in a tough spot where his request is reasonable, but the family's language use is also valid. The answer might depend on whether the wife can find a compromise, like translating key parts or having some time in English. But the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling this way or making the request. So, probably answer B (not in the wrong), but with nuance. The wife's irritation might stem from feeling caught between her parents and her spouse. So, the author's position isn't entirely wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
