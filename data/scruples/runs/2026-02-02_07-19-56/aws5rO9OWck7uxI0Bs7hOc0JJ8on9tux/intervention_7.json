I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife's parents are speaking French during dinner, which he can't understand. He asked her to stop, but she got irritated and said they weren't comfortable in English. The husband feels he should be exempt from these dinners if he can't understand the conversation.\n\nHmm. So, the husband is bilingual, and the wife is too, but her parents don't speak English. The husband wants to be included in the conversation. But he's asking her to make her parents speak English, which might not be fair. The wife's parents might not know English well, so expecting them to switch could be unreasonable. The husband's frustration is understandable, but is it his fault?\n\nWait, the husband says he's not trying to make her speak any language, but he's asking for the parents to speak English during their dinners. The wife is defending her parents, saying they're not comfortable. The husband feels disrespected or left out. But the parents are in their own home, so maybe they should be allowed to speak their native language. However, the husband is part of the family now, so maybe there's some expectation of inclusion.\n\nBut the husband is making a request that might be impossible. The wife is caught between her parents and her husband. The husband's approach might have been too abrupt, like asking to not come to dinners if they can't speak English. That could come off as selfish because the wife's parents are family, and it's expected to visit. However, the husband's feelings of exclusion are valid. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expressing that.\n\nSome might say the husband should try to learn French to better communicate, but he doesn't know it. Others might say the wife's family should make an effort to include him. But since the parents are not comfortable with English, it's not their fault. So maybe the husband is not in the wrong because he's expressing his needs. But maybe he's in the wrong for not being more understanding of his wife's parents' limitations. \n\nThe wife's response that he's selfish could be harsh, but the husband's request for inclusion is reasonable. However, the solution of not attending might not be the best approach. So perhaps the husband isn't entirely wrong, but his method could be better. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because he's advocating for his needs, even if the way he did it could be smoother. But maybe the wife is right in defending her parents. It's a bit of a grey area. I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's not forcing the language change on the wife, just asking for inclusion. So the answer is B.\n"
