I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present. The author doesn't know French and felt left out during a recent dinner with his wife's parents.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author and his wife are multilingual, so it's not about enforcing a specific language like English. The issue arises when the wife's parents only speak French in his presence, making him feel excluded. He asked if he could skip the dinners if he can't understand the conversations, leading to tension with his wife who thinks he's being selfish.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's in a multicultural marriage and feels uncomfortable when a family gathering excludes him by using a language he doesn't know. It's reasonable for him to want to be included, especially since he's part of the family by marriage. However, the wife's parents might feel more comfortable in their native language, which is common for many immigrant families. They might not intentionally exclude him but just naturally communicate in their primary language.\n\nThe author's request to not attend if he can't understand the conversations might come off as selfish because his wife's parents are her family, and attending could be seen as a necessary part of their relationship. However, the author isn't asking them to stop speaking French entirely, just to accommodate him when he's present. The wife's reaction that he's being selfish might stem from the belief that he should be more understanding of her parents' language preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's parents might be under her care and responsibility now, and she might need to mediate between her parents and her husband. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach\u2014threatening not to attend dinners\u2014might not be the best way to handle it. Perhaps a more constructive approach would be to ask the wife to translate or bridge the communication gap.\n\nIn terms of cultural sensitivity, both sides have valid points. The author has a right to feel included, but the wife's family's language is part of their cultural identity. The key is finding a balance. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be involved, but his method of handling it could be improved. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's making a reasonable request to be included without forcing his presence, maybe he's not entirely at fault. On the other hand, expecting the in-laws to change their language for him might be a valid point for the wife's side.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's nuance. However, the initial judgment might be that he's not in the wrong because his request is about inclusion, which is reasonable. Alternatively, if the request is seen as imposing on his wife's family's language practices, he could be at fault. But since he's not a member of her parents' family by blood, his expectations might be higher than a family member's. Hmm. Maybe the answer is a bit of both, but the question requires choosing A or B. Given the options, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his request is about being included in a situation where he's not part of the family by birth. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) because he's imposing on his wife's family's cultural practices. This is tricky. I'll need to make a decision based on the analysis.\n"
