I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife speaking French with her family during dinners that he attends, and he's requesting they switch to English so he can participate.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author and his wife both speak multiple languages, so it's not about forcing her to speak a specific language. The issue is when the wife's family uses French during meals, which he doesn't understand. He's feeling excluded and confused, especially when they laugh without him knowing the context. After dinner, he asks if he can skip these dinners if he can't understand the conversation, or at least have them speak English. The wife gets irritated, says her parents aren't comfortable with English, and he's upset about being labeled selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is not asking his wife to change her language in general, just during family dinners he's part of. He wants to understand and participate. His wife's family's native language is French, and they use it because they're more comfortable. The author is asking for a reasonable accommodation to be included in the conversation, which is a common courtesy when someone is part of the gathering. However, the wife is dismissing his request, suggesting that he should attend despite not understanding, which might make him feel like an outsider.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing anyone to speak a different language. He's making a polite request to be included in the conversation during a time when he's present. It's about mutual respect in a shared social setting. On the other hand, the wife's family has their own comfort zone with their language. But in a mixed family setting, especially when a non-French speaker is present, it's customary to make an effort to include everyone. The wife could encourage her parents to switch to English at least during family meals where the husband is involved, to make him feel part of the conversation. \n\nThe author's tone during his question might have been a bit abrupt, as he admits he could have taken a calmer approach. But the core request seems reasonable. Being in the wrong would depend on the context. If the wife's family has always spoken French and the husband didn't express discomfort before, maybe his sudden request is a point of contention. However, the husband is now part of the family dynamic, so expecting some level of inclusivity is fair. The wife's reaction of irritation and calling him selfish might indicate she's not considering his feelings. The husband isn't wrong for wanting to be included, especially if he's part of the family now. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
