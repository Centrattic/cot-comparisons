I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to stop speaking French with her family during dinner when he's present. The author and wife both speak multiple languages, so it's not about forcing English. He attended a dinner where her parents only spoke French except for brief introductions. He felt confused and out of the loop, especially when they laughed. After dinner, he asked if he can avoid these dinners if he can't understand, and the wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English but he should still come. He feels it's disrespectful to not show up but is upset because he has to be in that situation. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is being excluded from the conversation. The wife's parents are speaking a language he doesn't know, making him feel left out. He wants to be included, so he asked for a change. The wife's response was that he should still attend, implying it's important to meet her family despite the language barrier. \n\nIs it fair for the author to ask his wife to communicate in a way that includes him? Since the wife is bilingual, maybe she can translate or encourage her parents to use English when he's around. But the parents might be more comfortable in French, so expecting them to switch is a sensitive issue. The author might not be in the wrong because he's trying to be part of the family gatherings. However, maybe he could have approached the situation more calmly instead of making a direct request after being upset. The wife also didn't handle it well by getting irritated and labeling him selfish.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual understanding and inclusion in family matters, the wife's role in bridging the language gap, and the author's communication style. The author's right to feel included is valid, but his approach might have been abrupt. The wife's parents' comfort with French is understandable, but the family should consider the spouse's feelings. The answer might be B (No), as the author isn't necessarily wrong to want to be included, but there's room for better communication. Alternatively, A (Yes) if the wife's family's language choice isn't his problem. But since the wife is in the middle, maybe the author's request isn't unreasonable. The wife's reaction of calling him selfish might be the issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
