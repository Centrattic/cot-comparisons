I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present. The author doesn't know French and felt left out during a recent dinner with the wife's parents. He asked to not attend these dinners if he can't understand the conversation, but the wife got irritated and called him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he's part of a multilingual household, but he's not fluent in French. Being excluded from conversations with his wife's family might make him feel isolated. He's asking for a reasonable accommodation\u2014either to be included by speaking English or to be excused if that's not possible. His request is about his own comfort and inclusion in family gatherings.\n\nOn the wife's side, her parents are uncomfortable with English, which is their right. They might be more at ease in their native language, especially among family. The wife might feel that her parents' comfort is important and that her husband's request is putting an unfair burden on them to switch languages, which could be challenging for them.\n\nNow, the author's actions: he asked to not attend the dinners if he can't participate. That's a valid request. The wife's reaction was irritation, and she called him selfish. However, the author's tone might have been off, as he mentioned he could have taken a calmer approach. But the core issue is about communication and inclusion.\n\nIs the author being selfish? If the wife's family is unwilling to switch to English, the author is asking for a choice to opt out of a situation where he can't participate. That's not selfish; it's about mutual respect in a relationship. The wife's parents have the right to their language, but the author also has the right to feel included or have a choice in attending events where he's excluded.\n\nHowever, there's a balance. The wife might feel caught between her husband's needs and her family's. The author's approach could be seen as abrupt, but the request itself is understandable. The wife's response might be defensive, but she's also trying to honor her family's preferences.\n\nIn terms of cultural considerations, some families might view not attending such gatherings as disrespectful. However, the husband is not refusing to meet the parents; he's asking for a compromise. The key is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since he's the one feeling excluded and the family isn't willing to adjust, his request to opt out isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's advocating for his own needs in a multilingual setting where he can't fully participate. The wife's reaction might be harsh, but the author's stance is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
