I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop speaking French with her family during dinners. The author and his wife both speak multiple languages, so it's not an issue of enforcing a specific language. The problem arises when the author attends dinners at the wife's parents' place where they only speak French, which he doesn't understand. He felt confused and out of the loop, so he asked if he could skip these dinners if he can't understand the conversations. The wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English, and he felt he shouldn't be put in that situation.\n\nFirst, the author is not demanding the wife to speak a particular language; he's just asking to be included when he's present. It's reasonable to want to participate in conversations when he's part of the gathering. The wife's parents' use of French is their right, but the author's request isn't about them changing their language, just about the setting when he's there. However, the wife's parents might not be able to switch to English, which complicates things. The author's frustration is valid because being excluded from conversations can make someone feel isolated. But the wife's perspective is that attending these dinners is important for family relations, and her parents' comfort with French is a factor. The key issue is whether the author is being reasonable in expecting a shift in language use during these family dinners. Since the parents aren't his, he can't impose his language preferences on them. The author's solution (asking not to come) might be a bit extreme, but it's a way to avoid discomfort. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like asking the wife to translate key parts or for him to learn some French. The author's approach might be abrupt, but his feelings of being excluded are legitimate. The wife's reaction might be due to her feeling that her family's traditions are being challenged. It's a cultural sensitivity issue. The author isn't wrong for wanting to understand, but he might be wrong in expecting others to change for him. So, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there's room for compromise. But according to the options, A is if he's in the wrong, B if not. Since the author's request is reasonable and the wife's parents can't be expected to switch languages, the answer might be B.\n"
