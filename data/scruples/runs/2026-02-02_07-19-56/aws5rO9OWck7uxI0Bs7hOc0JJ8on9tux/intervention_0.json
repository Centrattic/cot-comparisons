I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop speaking French with her family during dinners when he's present. The author doesn't know French and found it confusing and frustrating. He asked if he could skip these dinners if he can't understand the conversation, but his wife got irritated and said he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and family dynamics. The wife's parents might prefer speaking French among themselves, which is natural for a bilingual family. The author is part of the family now, but he doesn't know French. His request to speak English makes sense because he can't participate or understand the interactions. However, the wife's parents might not be comfortable with English, so expecting them to switch languages could be challenging.\n\nThe author's reaction is about his right to feel included. It's reasonable to want to understand the conversations, especially during family dinners. However, the way he communicated his request\u2014maybe being abrupt\u2014could have contributed to the wife's irritation. The wife's perspective is that her parents are not comfortable with English, so she's defending their language choice. She might also feel that her husband is not respecting her family's customs.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to understand the interactions? Probably not. But maybe he could have approached the situation more diplomatically. The key points are mutual respect and finding a solution. The author isn't demanding the family to change their language entirely but is asking for inclusivity. The wife's parents might not be able to switch languages easily, so maybe the author can learn some French or the family can make an effort to include him in parts of the conversation.\n\nThe wife's reaction seems a bit harsh. Calling him selfish might not be fair, but her parents' comfort is also a valid concern. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be included, but perhaps he needs to find a middle ground. The answer hinges on balancing the author's needs with the family's language preferences. Since the author is part of the family now, it's important for both sides to make some adjustments. The wife's irritation might stem from feeling caught between her husband and her parents. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his feelings, but his approach could be improved. The wife isn't entirely in the right either for dismissing his concerns. The situation requires compromise, but the main issue here is whether the author was wrong in his initial request. Since he's asking for inclusion without demanding changes beyond his control (like the parents switching languages), he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
