I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife's family to speak English during dinners they attend together. The author speaks multiple languages, and so does his wife. The wife's parents only speak French, which he doesn't know. He felt left out during a dinner and asked if he could opt out of future dinners if he can't understand the conversation. His wife got irritated and said he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and familial context. The wife's parents might be more comfortable in French, so expecting them to switch to English might be challenging. The author's frustration is valid because he's not part of the conversation and feels excluded. However, the way he approached it\u2014asking to not attend future dinners\u2014could come off as dismissive of his wife's family. \n\nThe wife's reaction might stem from her feeling that her parents' comfort and her own cultural background are being overlooked. She might view the request as disrespectful to her parents. The author could have tried to find a middle ground, like learning some French phrases or having a pre-dinner talk to set expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to feel included in his wife's family gatherings, especially since he's part of the marriage. The problem here is communication. He could have expressed his feelings without demanding to not attend, perhaps by suggesting ways to include him, like translating key parts of the conversation. \n\nThe key points: The author's intent was to feel included, which is understandable. The wife's parents' language preference is a cultural aspect they can't easily change. The author might have handled the situation better but isn't entirely in the wrong. His wife's reaction might be defensive, seeing the request as disrespect towards her family. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's request is reasonable. He's not wrong for wanting inclusion, but his approach could have been more considerate. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. However, since the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, I need to check if my analysis aligns.\n"
