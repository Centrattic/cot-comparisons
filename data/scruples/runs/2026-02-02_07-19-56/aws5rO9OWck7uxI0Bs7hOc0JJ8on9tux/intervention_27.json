I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is upset with their wife for speaking French with her family during dinner, which he doesn't understand. He feels excluded and asked if he can stop attending those dinners, but his wife was irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is married to someone who speaks multiple languages, and they both share that. The issue isn't about language in their relationship but specifically about the wife's family speaking French during meals when he's present. The author felt left out and wanted to not attend if he can't understand the conversation. The wife's response was that her parents aren't comfortable with English, and he should still come. The author was upset and felt his wife called him selfish.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and understanding. The author's concern is valid because being unable to participate in the conversation can be alienating. However, the way he approached the situation might have been abrupt. He asked to stop attending without perhaps discussing it more calmly or finding a middle ground. The wife's perspective is that her family is not comfortable in English, which is their right. The author's reaction of being \"ticked off\" and his wife calling him selfish suggests a lack of communication on both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel included in family gatherings. On the other hand, the wife's family has the right to communicate in their native language. The author could have expressed his feelings without demanding not to attend, maybe suggesting a compromise, like learning some French or having a part of the dinner in English. The wife could also consider her husband's feelings and perhaps encourage her parents to speak English more during the meals when he's present.\n\nThe author's main issue is the exclusion, but his approach might have been too direct. He did mention he could have taken a calmer tone, which implies that his delivery was part of the problem. The wife's response was to dismiss his request, which might be valid if her parents aren't willing to switch languages, but she could also have tried to find a solution rather than just telling him to come regardless.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a shared responsibility. The author could have communicated better and found a solution rather than just asking to leave. The wife could have been more empathetic and found a way to include her husband. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. He's not entirely wrong because his feelings are valid, but his approach might have been flawed. However, the wife's family's right to speak their language is also valid. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he's expressing a legitimate concern, but the way he handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, since the wife's parents aren't comfortable in English, it's not entirely his fault. Maybe the answer is B, but I need to check if there's a cultural aspect where family time is expected to be in their native language. Alternatively, the author could have learned French or the wife could have acted as a translator. The fact that the author is asking to avoid the situation because of the language barrier might be seen as selfish, but he's not demanding the wife to stop speaking French in general, just in his presence. So, perhaps the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because he's within his rights to feel excluded and request to not attend if that's the case. But the wife's response is also not entirely wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's not forcing the wife to speak a language, just requesting not to be in a situation where he can't understand, maybe B is correct.\n"
