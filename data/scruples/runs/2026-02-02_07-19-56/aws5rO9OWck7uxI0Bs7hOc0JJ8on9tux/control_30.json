I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband being upset that his wife's family only speaks French during dinners, which he can't understand. He asked them to speak English or not have him present, and the wife got irritated, saying the parents aren't comfortable with English. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband doesn't know French and is uncomfortable not understanding the conversations. He asked to either switch to English or not attend, which the wife dismissed as selfish. The wife's parents aren't comfortable in English, according to her. \n\nI should consider cultural aspects here. Multilingual families often mix languages, especially in close-knit settings. The husband's frustration is valid because he can't participate or understand the conversations. However, the wife's parents are within their rights to speak their native language, which is French. The wife's response that her parents aren't comfortable with English might be true, but that doesn't mean the husband has to stay in a situation where he's excluded.\n\nBut wait, the husband is asking for a change in the parents' language use. Is that reasonable? The parents might not be willing or able to switch, especially if they're not comfortable with English. The husband's request is about his own comfort and inclusion, which is understandable. However, the wife might feel that his request is imposing on her family's cultural practices. The wife's irritation could stem from feeling caught between her husband's needs and her family's traditions.\n\nThe husband's approach of threatening to not attend if they don't switch might be seen as a bit abrupt. Maybe there's a middle ground, like having translation or separate time for family and couple conversations. But the husband's perspective is that he's being excluded, which is a valid concern. The wife's response that it's disrespectful not to attend might be a cultural expectation, but the husband's discomfort is also valid.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't wrong for wanting to understand the conversations he's part of. However, the wife and her parents aren't wrong for speaking their native language. The husband's approach could have been more considerate, but his feelings are legitimate. So, maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B), but there's room for both sides to find a solution. However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's parents' language choice isn't his fault, but his request for inclusion isn't unreasonable either. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his needs, even if it's a sensitive topic.\n"
