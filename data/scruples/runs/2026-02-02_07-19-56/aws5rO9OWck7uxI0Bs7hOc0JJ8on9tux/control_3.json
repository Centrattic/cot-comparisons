I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners, which he can't understand. The wife's parents are comfortable in French, not English.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is frustrated because he can't understand the conversations during family dinners. He felt excluded and confused, especially when they laughed, and he couldn't follow the humor. He asked if he can skip the dinners if they can't switch to English. The wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English, and he should attend regardless. He feels it's a problem and is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is at fault. The wife and her parents have the right to speak their native language, especially among family. Language is a cultural and personal choice. The author's issue is about feeling excluded, but the wife's parents might not be able to switch languages easily. The author's request to not attend if they can't speak English might seem self-centered because it's about his comfort versus their comfort. However, the author is also in a relationship and in a family situation where he's part of the partnership. The wife's parents being family, but the author is expected to attend, but maybe there's a middle ground.\n\nThe wife's response that it's disrespectful not to attend makes sense from her perspective. But the author's frustration is valid because he can't participate. However, the way he communicated it\u2014maybe being a bit abrupt or not considering the cultural aspect\u2014might be where he's in the wrong. The wife's parents might not be able to switch languages, so maybe the author should try to learn French or find another way to bridge the communication gap. The author is asking for the family to change their behavior for his comfort, which could be seen as selfish. But the wife's response was also a bit harsh, calling him selfish without addressing his feelings. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's expressing a valid concern about feeling excluded. However, the way he approached the situation and the expectation that the family must switch languages could be problematic. The wife's parents are entitled to speak their own language, and expecting them to switch for him might be unreasonable. The author might need to find another solution, like learning the language or engaging in other ways. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. The answer is probably B (Not in the wrong) because the core issue is about his request for a language change, which isn't his fault, but the communication style could be an issue. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong for making the request, which might not be the case. The wife's parents' right to their language is more important, so the author isn't at fault for asking, but the wife's reaction is also a problem. So the answer is B.\n"
