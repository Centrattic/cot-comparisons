I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is at fault here. The situation is that the author asked his wife to stop her parents from speaking French during family dinners because he doesn't understand it. The wife got irritated and said they shouldn't have to speak English, and the author feels like he's not in the wrong because he's just asking to be included in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his wife both speak multiple languages, so the author isn't trying to push his language on her. The issue is specifically about the wife's parents using French, which he can't understand. He's not asking them to speak his language, but to speak English when he's present. The wife's argument is that her parents aren't comfortable with English, but the author is frustrated because he's excluded from the conversation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, it's reasonable for the author to express discomfort about being excluded. However, the wife's parents might have their own reasons for speaking French, such as comfort or privacy. The author's approach\u2014threatening not to attend dinners if they don't switch to English\u2014could be seen as a bit abrupt. Maybe he could have approached the situation more gently, like discussing it with his wife first to find a compromise, rather than making an ultimatum.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. Being in a situation where you can't understand the main conversation can be isolating. The wife's response that it's disrespectful for him not to attend might be based on cultural expectations or family values. However, the author's right to feel included shouldn't be dismissed. The key here is balance: respecting the wife's family's comfort with their language while also addressing the author's need to participate.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong, but his method of handling it could be improved. He might have been too direct in his request, leading to tension. The wife, however, also needs to consider her partner's feelings and perhaps find a middle ground, like having some time in English for him to be included. Overall, the situation is a bit of a cultural and communication challenge, and both sides have valid points. But since the question is whether the author is at fault, I lean towards B (No), because his request isn't unreasonable, though his approach could have been better.\n"
