I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present. The author can't understand French, and he felt excluded during a dinner with her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and his wife both speak multiple languages, so the issue isn't about enforcing a language on her. He's not asking her to speak a specific language; he's asking her family to switch to English or not speak French in his presence. The main problem is that he feels excluded and frustrated because he can't participate in the conversation. He even asked to not attend the dinners if they can't speak English, but his wife is upset because her parents aren't comfortable with English.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings of being excluded and trying to communicate his needs. He's not forcing anyone to speak a certain language, just requesting that the family either switch to English or not have those conversations when he's there. His wife's parents aren't comfortable with English, which complicates things. The wife's response was that it's disrespectful not to attend, but the author feels he's being forced into a situation where he can't understand or engage.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's trying to respect his wife's family while also asserting his own needs. It's reasonable to ask for some level of inclusion in gatherings he attends. However, his approach might have been harsh, as he could have discussed it more calmly with his wife first. But the core issue is about being included in a language he doesn't understand, which is a valid concern. The wife's parents' comfort with English is a factor, but the author is within his rights to express discomfort and seek a solution. The wife's reaction, labeling him as selfish, might be an overreaction, especially since the author is trying to navigate a cultural difference in a respectful way.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
