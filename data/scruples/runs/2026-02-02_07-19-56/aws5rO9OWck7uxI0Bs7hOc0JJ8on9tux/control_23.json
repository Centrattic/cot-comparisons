I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the person asking their wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners, which he can't understand. The wife's parents only speak French except for the initial introductions. The author feels left out and confused, especially when they laugh in French. He then asks if he can skip these dinners if he can't understand them, and the wife gets irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English and that he should still come. The author feels the wife is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural aspects. The wife's family is multilingual, but they prefer French. It's common in many cultures for families to speak their native language at home, even if they know another. The author's request seems reasonable because he's part of the family now, so being excluded from conversations might make him feel like an outsider. However, the wife's parents might not be able to switch to English, which is a real challenge. \n\nThe author's approach was to demand that his wife make her parents stop speaking French, which might not be fair. The wife isn't the one controlling the language her parents use. The author could have tried learning some French or engaging in other ways during the dinner. Alternatively, he might have expressed his feelings without making the wife feel like she should change her parents' behavior. \n\nThe wife's response that her parents aren't comfortable with English is valid. It's not their fault if they can't switch languages. The author's frustration is understandable, but expecting the wife to make her parents speak English is unreasonable. He might have handled it better by being more patient or seeking a compromise instead of demanding exclusion. \n\nSo, the author's mistake is possibly not considering the limitations of his in-laws and not approaching the situation with more understanding. He might be in the right to feel excluded, but his method of handling it by blaming his wife and demanding change is where he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
