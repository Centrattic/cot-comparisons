I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author asked his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present, because he doesn't know French and felt excluded. The wife's parents only speak French, and the wife defended them, saying they aren't comfortable with English. The author then got upset and the wife called him selfish. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's part of the dinner and feels left out because he can't understand the language. He's not asking the family to learn English, just to speak English when he's there. But the wife's side is that her parents are not comfortable with English, so they speak French. The author's request is about communication during family dinners, which can be a sensitive issue in multicultural relationships.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he's not forcing his wife or her family to speak only English. He's asking to be included in the conversation. But maybe there's a misunderstanding. The author's frustration is valid because he's in a situation where he can't participate. However, the wife's family might have limited English, so expecting them to switch languages could be a burden. The author could have approached this more gently, perhaps by talking to his wife first to find a compromise, like having a translator or a family member switch languages when discussing certain topics. Alternatively, he might consider learning some French to bridge the gap.\n\nThe wife's reaction of getting irritated and calling him selfish suggests she feels his request is unreasonable. Maybe she sees it as an intrusion on family traditions or comfort. The author's tone during the conversation could have been a factor. If he was more understanding and sought a solution together, perhaps the outcome would be better. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to be included, but he might have handled the situation better. The wife's family's comfort with English is a key point. However, the author's approach in asking to not attend dinners if they can't switch languages might come across as dismissive of his wife's family. So, while there's some fault on both sides, the author's insistence on being excluded might not be entirely his fault, but his handling of the situation could be improved. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with nuance. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
