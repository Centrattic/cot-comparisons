I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if it's their fault for asking their wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinner when they're present. The user says they can't understand the French conversations and felt left out, especially when the family laughs and he doesn't know what's being said.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife and the author both speak multiple languages, so it's not about enforcing a specific language. The issue is that during family dinners, the wife's parents only speak French, and the author feels excluded because he doesn't know the language. He asked if he can skip these dinners if he can't understand the conversation, and the wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English. The author feels it's unfair to be in this situation and maybe should have been calmer, but he still thinks he's right.\n\nNow, evaluating both sides. The author's point is that he's uncomfortable not understanding the conversations and that he's being asked to attend dinners where he can't participate. The wife's side is that her parents are not comfortable with English, so they speak French. The author might be in the right because it's reasonable to expect a spouse to accommodate their partner's comfort, especially in a shared family event. However, the wife might feel that her parents have the right to speak their native language, especially if they're not fluent in English.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for a change. If the wife's parents are only comfortable in French, it's not their fault for speaking their own language. The author is asking for them to switch languages, which might be a reasonable request if it's a shared family gathering where the author is part of the family. However, if the wife's parents are not fluent in English, they can't be forced to speak it. So the author's request is understandable, but the wife's parents' language choice is also valid. The author might not be in the wrong because he's seeking to include himself in the family interactions, which is reasonable. However, the way he approached it (maybe being too direct or not understanding the parents' limitations) could be part of the issue. But the main question is if he's in the wrong for making the request. Since he's part of the family now, it's reasonable to ask for some accommodation so he can participate. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
