I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's wife speaking French with her family during dinners, which he can't understand. He feels excluded and asked to stop attending if they can't speak English, but his wife got upset and said he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author isn't against his wife speaking French; he just wants to be included when he's part of the gathering. He's not forcing her to speak any language, just asking for some English so he can participate. On the other hand, the wife's parents might be more comfortable in French, which is their native language. It's common for families to speak their heritage language, especially with relatives.\n\nThe author's request seems reasonable. If he's at the table, wanting to understand the conversation isn't unreasonable. However, he did ask to stop attending if they can't switch to English, which might come off as abrupt. Maybe a compromise could be better, like having some time for French and some for English. But the wife's reaction was irritation, which might be because she feels her family's comfort is important. \n\nAlso, the author could have approached it more calmly, as he mentioned. His tone might have contributed to the conflict. But is he in the wrong? He's not forcing anyone to speak English, just expressing a desire to be included. The wife's parents aren't comfortable with English, so expecting them to switch entirely is a lot. The author's feeling of exclusion is valid, but the wife's position is also about family comfort. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be included, but his approach could have been better. The wife might not be entirely wrong either. Since the question is binary (A or B), and the author's request isn't inherently wrong, the answer is probably B. He's not in the wrong, but there's room for compromise.\n"
