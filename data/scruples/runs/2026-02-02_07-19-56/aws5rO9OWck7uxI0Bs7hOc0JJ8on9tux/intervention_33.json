I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for requesting that their wife's family stop speaking French during dinners. The author speaks multiple languages but not French, and they felt left out during a family dinner. They asked if they could skip future dinners if they can't understand the conversation, which upset the wife, who argued that her parents aren't comfortable in English.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication in multilingual families and mutual respect. The author isn't forcing the wife to speak a language, but they want to be included. On one hand, the wife's parents have the right to use their native language, which is common in many immigrant families. On the other hand, the author is trying to feel included in family gatherings, which is also valid. \n\nThe author's approach might have been abrupt. Instead of asking to skip dinners, maybe they could have asked to learn some French or have translation. But the wife's response, calling the author selfish, seems harsh. The author's request isn't about controlling the language but about inclusion. \n\nHowever, the wife's parents not being comfortable in English is a valid point. It's not the author's fault that they don't know French. The conflict arises from differing cultural expectations. Maybe there's a middle ground, like having some English conversations or the wife translating. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong. They have a right to feel included. But maybe they could have approached it differently. But the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Now I'm conflicted. Let's see, the author isn't forcing language, just wants to understand. The wife's parents are the ones using French. The author's request to leave might be seen as not wanting to make an effort, but their frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking inclusion, and it's reasonable to ask for some accommodation. The wife's parents' language preference is valid, but the author's feelings should also be considered. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
