I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author being upset that his wife's family only speaks French during dinners, which he doesn't understand. He asked to not attend if he can't understand, but his wife says it's disrespectful to not show up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective: he's part of the family, but he can't understand the conversations. He felt excluded and wanted to avoid the stress of not knowing what's being said. He communicated his feelings but maybe in a less-than-calm way. His wife's parents might not be comfortable with English, so they stick to French. The wife's stance is that it's important to attend family dinners regardless. \n\nNow, considering cultural norms. In many multicultural situations, families might use their native language among themselves, especially if they're more comfortable with it. The author is part of the family through marriage, but he's not a native French speaker. His right to feel included is valid, but his wife's family has their own comfort zone. \n\nIs the author wrong for expressing his discomfort? Well, he did ask his wife to address it, which is not unreasonable. However, expecting the entire family to switch languages might be a tall order. His wife's parents might not see a reason to change, especially if they're not with the author often. \n\nThe author's reaction of wanting to stop attending if he can't understand might be seen as selfish because attending family dinners is a cultural norm in many places, and his wife is part of that family. But he's also within his rights to feel included. The key here is communication and compromise. \n\nThe wife's irritation suggests that the author's approach might have been too abrupt or not considering her position. Maybe a more collaborative approach would have been better, like suggesting alternative ways to include him, such as translating key parts or having some English conversation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards him not being entirely in the wrong. He's expressing his needs, which is important in a relationship. However, his approach could have been more considerate. The wife's family's language preference is also valid. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with nuance."
