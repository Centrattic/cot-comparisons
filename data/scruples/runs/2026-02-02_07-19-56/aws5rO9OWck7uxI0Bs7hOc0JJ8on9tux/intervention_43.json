I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife's family speaking French during dinners, which the author doesn't understand. The author asked his wife to stop, but she got irritated and said it's about respect.\n\nFirst, the author says he has no intention of making her speak any language, and they both speak multiple languages. So, that part is clear. The problem arises when he's at his wife's parents' table, where they only speak French. He felt left out and confused, especially when they laughed, not knowing what was going on. He asked not to attend if he can't understand, but his wife said her parents aren't comfortable with English. He got upset, maybe a bit too quickly, and the wife called him selfish.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and cultural considerations. The author is asking his wife to have her family speak English during his presence. The wife's parents might feel more at home speaking French, and the author might feel excluded. But is it reasonable to ask them to switch languages? \n\nCulturally, families often speak their native language together, especially if they're not comfortable in another. The wife's position is that it's disrespectful for the author not to attend. The author might feel that attending without understanding the conversation is uncomfortable. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached the situation differently. Maybe suggesting a compromise, like having part of the conversation in English, or learning some French to better understand. The author's reaction of wanting to not attend seems a bit extreme if the goal is to maintain a good relationship with the in-laws. Also, the wife's parents' comfort with language is a factor here. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't force them to switch languages. He just asked his wife to address it, which might be a reasonable request. The wife's response that her parents aren't comfortable in English might mean they can't switch. So, the author's request might not be feasible. \n\nIs the author being selfish for not attending? The wife thinks so, but the author feels it's about comfort. There's a balance between respecting the in-laws' language and the author's need to participate. If the author is part of the family, maybe he should make an effort to bridge the language gap. But the wife's family isn't making an effort to include him, which is the crux. \n\nThe author's tone during the discussion might have been harsh, which could have contributed to the wife's irritation. However, the core issue is the language barrier. So, is the author wrong for wanting to not attend if he can't understand? Maybe not entirely, but the way he approached it could have been better. \n\nConsidering all this, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his discomfort. However, he could have been more understanding of the wife's parents' situation. The answer might be a middle ground, but since the options are A or B, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he's trying to communicate his needs, even if the approach could be improved. The wife's family's language use is a valid cultural aspect, but the author's feelings are also valid. However, the author's demand to not attend might be too abrupt. But overall, the author is trying to address a legitimate issue, so he's not entirely at fault. Therefore, answer B.\n"
