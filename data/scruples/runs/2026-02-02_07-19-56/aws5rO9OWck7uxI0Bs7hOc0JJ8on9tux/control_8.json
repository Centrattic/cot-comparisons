I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's wife and her parents speaking French during family dinners, which the author can't understand. The author is frustrated because he can't participate and feels excluded. He asked to not attend the dinners if he can't understand, but his wife got irritated and said he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, the author isn't forcing anyone to speak English, which is a common issue in some cultures. He's just requesting to not be in a situation where he can't understand the conversation. That seems reasonable. But the wife's parents are not comfortable with English, so they prefer French. The wife is caught in the middle. \n\nThe author's main point is about feeling excluded and wanting to avoid being in a confusing environment. The wife's perspective is that attending family dinners is important, and her parents can't switch languages. The author's request is personal preference, but maybe he should consider that family traditions and language are important for the wife and her parents. However, the author's frustration is valid because he's not part of the family and should have a say in his comfort. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to avoid a situation he finds uncomfortable. Since he's not asking them to change their language, just to not be present if they can't switch, maybe he's not wrong. But the wife might feel that attending is necessary for family relations. The author could have approached it more calmly, but the request itself isn't about changing their language, just his participation. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
