I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (let's call him A) is married to a woman whose parents speak French, which he doesn't understand. During a family dinner, they spoke French almost the whole time except for a few words when they introduced A. A felt left out and confused, especially when they laughed, so after dinner, he asked if he can avoid attending future dinners if he can't understand the conversation or at least have some English. His wife got irritated, said her parents aren't comfortable with English, and he should still come because it's disrespectful not to show up. A is upset because he doesn't think he has to be in that situation. He also admits he could have taken a calmer tone.\n\nNow, the user thinks A is in the wrong. Let's break this down. First, language in family settings can be complex. The wife's parents are speaking their native language, which is a cultural thing. It's common for families to use their heritage language at home. The author is married into this family, but that doesn't necessarily mean he has to be comfortable with their language. However, he's asking to opt out of dinners because he can't participate, which might be seen as avoiding family time, which could be a point of contention.\n\nOn one hand, A's feelings are valid. Being in a social setting where you can't understand the conversation can be isolating and uncomfortable. If the wife's parents are only speaking French and aren't making an effort to include him, it's reasonable for him to feel left out. He's not asking them to switch to English entirely, just to make it possible for him to participate. But maybe they are not comfortable with English, which his wife mentioned. However, they could make a small effort to include him, maybe by speaking more English or translating key parts of the conversation. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's parents have the right to speak their language. It's their home, their family time. The author is a guest, but guests usually expect some level of effort to include them, especially if they are part of the family. However, the wife's stance is that her parents aren't comfortable with English, so maybe they can't switch. But if A is part of their daughter's life, maybe they should make an effort. The wife telling him to come regardless because it's disrespectful could be part of the problem. If the environment is consistently unwelcoming, maybe A is justified in not attending.\n\nThe author's approach might have been too direct. Asking to not attend at all might come across as avoiding rather than seeking a compromise. Maybe a better approach would be to ask for some English to be used, but he did mention he asked for speaking English. The wife's response was that her parents aren't comfortable, but is that a valid reason not to accommodate the husband? Maybe not entirely. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author might have not communicated his feelings effectively. Instead of asking to not attend, maybe expressing that he feels left out and asking for some effort to include him. If the wife is unwilling to discuss that, then maybe the fault lies with her and her parents. \n\nSo, is A in the wrong? He's not demanding they speak only French, but he's asking to be excluded from dinner if they can't communicate in a way he can understand. That might be seen as selfish, but it's also about his comfort and inclusion. The wife's side is about family respect and tradition. It's a cultural clash. Depending on the culture, showing up even if not fully included might be expected. But if the author is part of the family now, maybe the family should make an effort. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author could have handled it more calmly, as he admits. But his request isn't unreasonable. The wife's response that her parents aren't comfortable with English might not be a valid excuse, but it's also their home. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The wife and parents might need to make more effort. But the author's approach could have been more diplomatic. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his comfort over family expectations, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a shared responsibility. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given the options, B (not in the wrong) might be the answer because his request is understandable and the family isn't making an effort. But some might see him as selfish for not attending. Hmm. It's tricky. I'm leaning towards B because his request is about inclusion and the family isn't accommodating. So he's not in the wrong.\n"
