I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeling excluded because his wife's family only speaks French during dinners, which he can't understand. The author asked to not attend future dinners if he can't participate in the conversation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he and his wife speak multiple languages, so it's not about forcing English. That's a good point because he's not being pushy about language. The problem here is the dinner meetings with the in-laws. The wife's parents are uncomfortable with English, so they speak French. The author feels left out and frustrated because he can't engage, leading to communication issues. He asked to not attend, but the wife got irritated, calling him selfish.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, families often stick to their native language, especially when they're more comfortable in it. The author is a guest, and the wife's parents might not be open to switching languages. The author's request to not attend could be seen as a way to avoid discomfort, but does he have a right to that? On the other hand, the wife's argument is about respecting her parents by showing up. \n\nThe author could be in the wrong if he's prioritizing his comfort over his wife's feelings and the importance of family gatherings. However, he's also not wrong for feeling excluded. Maybe the middle ground is that he should try to find a way to engage without forcing the family to switch, like focusing on his wife or the food, or even learning some French. But his reaction of asking not to attend might be too extreme. \n\nAlternatively, the wife's parents might not make an effort to include him, which isn't the author's fault. The author's tone might have been harsh, but his request isn't unreasonable if he feels it's too alienating. However, since it's his wife's family, maybe the expectation is to participate as a guest, even if it's not in his preferred language. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He's expressing a valid concern about being excluded. However, his approach could be better. Instead of backing out, maybe he should communicate more with his wife to find a compromise. The wife's irritation might stem from feeling caught between her parents' preferences and her husband's discomfort. The author's request isn't selfish but could be perceived as such if not handled gently. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides.\n"
