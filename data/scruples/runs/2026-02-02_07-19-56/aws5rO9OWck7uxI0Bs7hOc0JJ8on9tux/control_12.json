I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset that his wife and her parents are speaking French during dinner, which he doesn't understand. He asked her to stop, but she was irritated and said her parents aren't comfortable with English. He's confused because he feels he shouldn't have to be in that situation.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author isn't trying to force the wife to speak a specific language, which is good. He's not pushing for \"speak American,\" as he mentioned. The issue is that during family dinners, the conversations are in French, leaving him out. He asked to not attend those dinners if he can't participate, but the wife and her parents aren't comfortable with English. \n\nNow, considering cultural aspects. Multilingual families often have their own language for comfort. The parents might prefer speaking French among themselves. The author is part of the family now (as he's married to the wife), but being excluded from conversations could be a problem. He's asking to be included or at least not forced to sit in confusion. \n\nIs the author being selfish? The wife says he's being selfish. But he's expressing a legitimate need to be part of the family interactions. If he can't understand the language, he's isolated. On the other hand, the wife and her parents have the right to speak their preferred language. \n\nThe author could have taken a more calm tone, as he admitted. That might have helped, but that doesn't necessarily make him in the wrong. The core issue is about inclusion vs. cultural comfort. There's a balance here. Maybe the author could learn French, but he doesn't have to. The wife's parents might not need to switch to English, but there could be a middle ground, like some English for his benefit.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the answer depends on mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't being unreasonable to want to participate. The wife's parents might not be able to switch languages, but the wife could mediate. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing his need to be included. However, he might need to find a compromise rather than just opting out of dinners. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for his request. Since he's not forcing them, just asking to not be present, it's more about his comfort. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. His request is valid, and the wife's parents' language preference is understandable, but he's not obligated to be in a situation where he's excluded. The wife's irritation might be because of the pressure to choose between her family and her spouse, but the author's stance isn't inherently wrong.\n"
