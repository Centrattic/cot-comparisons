I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is upset because their wife's family only speaks French during dinners, and he doesn't understand. He asked to not come to those dinners if they can't speak English, and his wife got irritated, calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The author and his wife both speak multiple languages, so it's not about language restrictions. The issue is the wife's parents not making an effort to include him by switching to English. The author feels excluded because he can't understand the conversations. \n\nIs it reasonable for him to ask for English? Well, if the wife's parents aren't comfortable with English, that's their issue. But when the author is present, maybe they should make an effort to include him. However, the wife is their child, so maybe they expect her to bridge the communication gap. But the author is part of the family now, so maybe he has a right to be included. \n\nThe author's approach was to ask to not attend if they can't switch, which the wife found irritating. The wife's response was that he's being selfish. But the author is in a new environment, and being excluded is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not forcing anyone to speak a language, but he's expressing his discomfort. The wife's parents aren't making an effort, and the wife is caught in the middle. The author's request is about his own experience, not dictating language use. He might have a valid point about feeling excluded. However, maybe there's a way to handle it without opting out entirely. But given the situation, his request seems reasonable. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
