I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is married to someone who speaks French with her family. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting her to stop speaking French during family dinners when he's present because he can't understand it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author doesn't want to feel excluded during these meals, especially when he can't partake in the conversation. On the other hand, the wife is from a French-speaking family, and they might be more comfortable in their native language. The author's main issue is feeling left out and confused, and he's asking to not attend these dinners if the language barrier remains.\n\nNow, the wife's parents not being comfortable with English is a factor. But the author is in a relationship with the wife, not the parents. The wife is part of the equation here. The author is asking her to mediate, to have the conversations in a language he can understand. However, the wife is defensive and tells him he's being selfish. \n\nI wonder if the author is overstepping by expecting the entire family to switch languages for him. But then again, the author is part of the family unit now, and it's reasonable for him to want to be included. The wife might not realize the impact of speaking French in his presence when he can't understand it. \n\nThe author's tone is a point he acknowledges\u2014he could have been calmer. However, the main issue is his request. Is it reasonable? Maybe the wife could explain to her parents that when the author is present, they should try to speak English. But the wife is saying they aren't comfortable with English. That might be true, but the husband is part of the family now. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is being a bit self-centered. The parents have their own comfort zones. But the husband is in a new situation where he's expected to attend these dinners, and he's not getting a chance to engage. Is it the husband's problem if he doesn't want to be excluded, or is it the wife's responsibility to bridge that gap?\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong. He's trying to communicate his feelings of exclusion and is seeking a solution. However, he might need a better approach, like discussing it more calmly with the wife first before suggesting not attending. The wife's reaction might be due to feeling her family's language is being dismissed. But the husband's request is about his own experience. So maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nBut the wife's parents not speaking English is a cultural aspect. The husband might need to either learn French or accept that sometimes he can't be part of the conversation. But he's in a relationship with the wife, who can translate or include him. The problem arises when the wife isn't facilitating that. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's expressing a valid concern about feeling excluded and is asking for a reasonable adjustment. The wife's parents' comfort is important, but the husband is part of the family unit now, and the wife could help mediate that. The author isn't asking for the parents to change, but for the family dinners to be inclusive when he's present.\n"
