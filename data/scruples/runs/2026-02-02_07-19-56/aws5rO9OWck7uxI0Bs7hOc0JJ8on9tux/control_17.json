I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to stop speaking French with her family during dinners when he's present. The author mentions he doesn't want to force her to speak any language, but he's uncomfortable not understanding the conversations and feeling excluded. He had dinner with her parents where they only spoke French except for the introductions. He asked to not attend those dinners if he can't understand or at least speak English. His wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable in English, and he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and familial dynamics. The wife's parents are using their native language, which is French. It's common for families to stick to their primary language, especially if they're not fluent in another. The author is asking for a change in their behavior to accommodate his comfort, which might not be their responsibility. However, he's also a guest in their home, so expecting some consideration for his presence is reasonable.\n\nThe author's point is about inclusion. He wants to understand the conversation, especially since he's part of the family. If the wife's parents only speak French among themselves, it's understandable that he feels left out. But the wife's argument is that her parents aren't comfortable in English. It's a balance between respecting the family's language use and the guest's wishes. \n\nHe did ask to not attend if he can't understand, which is a valid request. The wife's response that it's disrespectful to not show up might be true, but that doesn't necessarily mean he should have to be in an uncomfortable situation. Maybe there's a middle ground, like having a separate conversation or the wife translating more. \n\nHe could have taken a calmer tone, as he acknowledges, which might have helped the discussion. But the core issue is about his right to feel included versus the in-laws' comfort with their language. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong because he's expressing his discomfort. However, expecting others to change their language for him might be seen as a bit much, especially if they're not obligated to accommodate. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because he's not wrong for wanting to understand the conversation, but he also needs to find a respectful way to address it, maybe through compromise rather than an ultimatum. The wife's parents have the right to use their language, but the author's feelings are valid. The key is how to handle it without making it a conflict. The author's approach might not be the best, but he isn't in the wrong per se. It's more about communication and finding solutions together.\n"
