I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present, since he doesn't understand French.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he and his wife both speak multiple languages, so it's not about enforcing English. The issue is that during family dinners with the wife's parents, everything is in French, making him feel excluded. He tried to address it by asking to not attend if he can't understand, which led to conflict with his wife. The wife's side is that her parents aren't comfortable with English, so he should still come. The author got upset and might have been too harsh, but he feels it's unfair to be in that situation.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points are communication, mutual respect, and cultural norms. The wife's family's primary language is French, and they might feel more at ease using it among themselves. The husband's frustration is valid because he's not part of the conversation, which can be isolating. However, the wife's parents have the right to use their native language in their home. The husband's request to not attend if he can't understand is a bit of a harsh solution. Instead of cutting off contact, he could work on learning some French or using translation tools. The wife might want to mediate by having some English conversations when he's present. But the husband's approach was abrupt\u2014saying he doesn't have to be in the situation. That's where the conflict arises. He might be in the wrong for not considering alternatives and for the tone. The wife is right in wanting to maintain her family's language and traditions, but she could also help bridge the gap. So, the husband's actions were a bit self-centered, hence answer A.\n"
