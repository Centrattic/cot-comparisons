I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is married to a woman who speaks multiple languages. When they have dinner with her parents, the parents only speak French, which the author doesn't know. The author felt confused and out of the loop, especially when they laughed without him understanding why. He asked if he could skip these dinners if he can't understand the conversations, but his wife got irritated and said her parents aren't comfortable with English. She told him to still come because it's disrespectful not to show up. The author got ticked off, thinking he shouldn't be forced into this situation. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author isn't pushing his wife to speak any language; he's just asking about the family dinners. The main issue is that he feels excluded because he can't understand French. He's not asking the parents to speak English, but he wants to be able to communicate or at least not be in a situation where he's not part of the conversation. His wife seems to think it's disrespectful for him not to attend, but the author feels it's unfair to be in a confusing and uncomfortable environment.\n\nOn one hand, the wife's parents might feel more comfortable in their native language, which is understandable. Cultural and familial traditions can be important. On the other hand, the author is part of the family now, and being excluded from conversations during family dinners could make him feel like an outsider. The wife's response was to tell him it's disrespectful not to attend, but maybe she could have addressed the author's concerns more empathetically, perhaps by translating key parts or finding a middle ground.\n\nThe author did ask for a compromise (either speak English or let him skip), which is reasonable. His wife's reaction was to call him selfish, which might not help resolve the issue. The author's tone might have been too direct, but his request seems valid. It's about feeling included and respected in his own right. So, is the author wrong for wanting to not be in a situation where he can't participate? Probably not. He's expressing a legitimate concern about feeling isolated. The wife's parents' preference is valid, but the couple needs to find a solution that respects both parties. The author isn't wrong to ask for a way to handle this, even if the approach could be smoother. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
