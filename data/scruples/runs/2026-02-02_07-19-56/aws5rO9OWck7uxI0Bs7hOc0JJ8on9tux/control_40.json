I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop speaking French with her family during dinners when he's present.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they both speak multiple languages, so it's not about forcing English. The problem is that during dinner with her parents, they only speak French, which he doesn't understand. He felt confused and excluded when they laughed in French. After dinner, he asked if he can skip future dinners if he can't understand the conversation, and his wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English. He's upset because he feels he shouldn't have to be in that situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, respect, and mutual understanding. The author wants to be included in the conversations during family dinners, which is understandable. His request is about being able to participate or at least understand the environment. However, his wife's parents are not comfortable with English, so expecting them to switch languages might be difficult. The author's wife is caught between her parents' preferences and her partner's needs. \n\nThe author's approach was to say he might not attend if he can't understand, which the wife found irritating. He might have come off as dismissive or demanding, but his underlying need for inclusion is valid. On the other hand, the wife's parents have the right to use their preferred language. The author isn't wrong for wanting to understand, but his method of handling it could have been more considerate. It's a communication issue rather than a clear right or wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing anyone to switch languages but is expressing his discomfort and asking for a solution, maybe he's justified. But the wife's perspective is also important. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how they handle such situations. Since the author is not demanding language change but seeking inclusion, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But maybe he could have approached it differently. Hmm.\n"
