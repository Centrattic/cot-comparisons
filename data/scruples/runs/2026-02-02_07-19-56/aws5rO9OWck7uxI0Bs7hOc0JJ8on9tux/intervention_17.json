I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's wife and her parents speaking French during dinner, which the author doesn't understand. The author asked to not come to these dinners or at least for them to speak English, but the wife and her parents prefer French.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel excluded because he can't understand the conversations and isn't part of the family interactions. It's understandable that he's frustrated, especially since the family laughs in French and he can't grasp the context. On the other hand, the wife and her parents might be more comfortable speaking their native language, which is common in multilingual families. They might not want to switch to English just for him, and the wife might feel that her family's comfort is important.\n\nThe author's actions: he asked to not attend the dinners if he can't understand, which could be seen as a reasonable request for his comfort. But the wife called him selfish. The author's tone might have been too harsh, but the underlying issue is valid. Is it unreasonable to expect some accommodation in a multicultural relationship? Or is the wife's family's language preference more important?\n\nAlso, the author isn't asking his wife to stop using French entirely but just during his presence. However, language is a big part of cultural identity, and expecting others to switch might be a lot. The wife's parents might not be able to switch to English easily if they're not fluent. So the author's request could be seen as a bit much. \n\nBut the author is part of the family now, through marriage, so there might be an expectation of some level of inclusion. Maybe a compromise could be made, like having some time where they speak French and some where they switch to English. However, the author's approach of asking to not attend at all might be too extreme. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's being unreasonable by expecting the entire family to switch, then he's in the wrong (A). If his request is reasonable and the wife and parents should accommodate to include him, then he's not (B). Considering that the wife's parents might not be comfortable with English, it's possible that the author is overstepping, but he's also entitled to feel included. It's a tricky balance. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of their relationship. Since the author didn't ask his wife to stop using French in general but just during these dinners, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the way he phrased his request and the wife's reaction could indicate that his approach was too abrupt. The correct answer might be B, that he's not in the wrong, but there's nuance here. Alternatively, maybe A, considering the family's right to their language. Hmm.\n"
