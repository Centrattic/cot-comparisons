I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault here. The situation is about the author's wife speaking French with her parents during dinner, and the author not understanding French. The author felt excluded and asked to not attend those dinners or to switch to English. The wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable in English, and the author is now asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and personal boundaries. The wife's family using their native language is common, especially in family settings. It's a way to maintain cultural ties and comfort. The author isn't comfortable because he can't understand, which is valid. But does that mean he's at fault for bringing it up?\n\nThe author tried to communicate his discomfort by asking to not attend or switch languages. The wife's response was that her parents aren't comfortable with English, which might be true. The author might feel left out, but is it unreasonable to expect the wife's family to accommodate? Or is the author's request unreasonable?\n\nAlso, the author mentioned he could have been calmer, so maybe his approach was a bit abrupt. However, the core issue is about feeling excluded. The wife's parents might not be able to switch languages easily, especially if they're not fluent. The author's request to not attend might be about his comfort, but family dinners can be important for the marriage. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the family has the right to speak their language. On the other, the author's feelings are valid. But since the author is part of the family now, maybe he's expected to adapt. However, the wife's response might not have been empathetic. The author isn't asking the wife to stop speaking French, just not during family dinners where he's present. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. He's asking for a reasonable accommodation to feel included, and his feelings are valid. The wife's family's language use is normal, but the author's request isn't unreasonable. The wife's irritation might be unwarranted. However, the author could have approached it more calmly, but that doesn't make him wrong in the request itself.\n"
