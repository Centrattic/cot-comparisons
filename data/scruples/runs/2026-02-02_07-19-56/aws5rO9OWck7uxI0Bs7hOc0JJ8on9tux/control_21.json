I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife's family speaking French, which the author doesn't know, during dinners. The author feels excluded and asked to stop coming if they can't speak English, but the wife got irritated. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is multilingual, and the wife is also multilingual. The family uses French, which the author doesn't know. The author attended a dinner where they couldn't understand the conversation, leading to confusion. He asked to not come if they can't speak English, but the wife said they aren't comfortable with English. The author then expressed frustration, was called selfish, and now he's seeking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's main issue is feeling excluded because the family's language is inaccessible. He's not asking to change the family's language, which is a part of their culture. However, when he asked to not attend if they can't speak English, that might be where the problem is. The wife's parents might not be able or willing to switch, which is their right. The author's request to leave is about his comfort, but maybe he's assuming that the only solution is for the family to switch languages, not considering other options like learning some French, using translation, or the wife translating for him. Alternatively, maybe the author should have communicated his feelings more calmly, as he mentioned he could have taken a more calm tone. The wife's response that it's disrespectful not to attend is valid because not showing up for family gatherings can be seen as rude in many cultures. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach might be seen as self-centered if he's not considering the family's perspective. However, he's also within his rights to feel uncomfortable and want to be included. The key points are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be included, but his method of handling it might not have been the best. The wife's parents not switching to English isn't their fault either. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it better. The answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
