I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves the author asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinner when he's present, because he doesn't understand French. The wife and he both speak multiple languages, but he's upset about not being able to understand the conversations at her parents' dinners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and personal aspects. The wife's parents are speaking in French, their native language, which is their right. They might feel more comfortable in their own language, especially when discussing certain topics. The author is asking them to speak English, which is understandable, but it's a request that might infringe on the family's cultural practices.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because he's excluded from the conversation and can't participate. However, his approach might be seen as demanding. He asked to skip dinners if he can't understand, which the wife interprets as selfish. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The author's tone and the way he phrased the request could have been better, but his feelings are valid too.\n\nIn terms of cultural sensitivity, the wife's parents have the right to use their native language. The author expects to be included, which is reasonable, but the solution might involve compromise. Maybe the author could try learning some French to bridge the gap, or the wife could translate for him. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be included, but he might not consider the cultural significance of the parents' language use.\n\nThe wife's perspective is also important. She's caught between her parents and her husband's needs. Her irritation might stem from feeling like she's having to choose sides. However, her parents' language preference is a cultural aspect that should be respected unless there's a mutual agreement otherwise.\n\nIn conclusion, neither party is entirely wrong. The author's request for inclusion is understandable, but he should approach it with more sensitivity towards the cultural practices of his wife's family. The wife should also facilitate communication where possible. The answer might lean towards the author not being entirely in the wrong but needing to adjust his approach.\n"
