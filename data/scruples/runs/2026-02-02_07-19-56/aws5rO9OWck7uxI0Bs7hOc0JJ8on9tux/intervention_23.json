I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop talking French during family dinners.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't want to force the wife to speak any language, which is good. They mention that they can't understand French, so during the dinner with the wife's parents, they felt left out. The author then asks to not attend these dinners if they can't understand the conversation. The wife is upset, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English and insists he should still come.\n\nHmm, the author's concern is about feeling excluded. That's valid, especially in a family setting where communication is key. But maybe the way he approached it was abrupt? He says he could have taken a calmer tone, which suggests he might have acted impulsively. On the other hand, the wife's parents have a right to speak their native language, especially if they're not comfortable with English. They might feel more at ease with French, and it's part of their cultural identity.\n\nThe author's demand to not attend dinners if they can't understand might be seen as selfish because it's about his comfort over the wife's family's needs. But at the same time, the author has a right to feel included. Maybe a middle ground could be finding a way to bridge the language gap, like asking the wife to translate key parts or attending but managing expectations about understanding everything. \n\nHowever, the author's immediate reaction was to threaten not attending, which the wife found disrespectful. The wife's point is that attending the dinner is important for cultural or familial reasons, and the author's refusal could be seen as dismissive of that. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but perhaps he didn't consider alternative solutions first. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife's parents speaking French is their right, and the author's request to not attend if he can't understand might be a bit self-centered. However, if the author's presence is causing conflict, maybe he should find a way to adapt, like learning some French or the wife translating. But the author is also within his rights to feel uncomfortable. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't approach the situation with enough empathy towards the wife's family's comfort. He should have discussed it more with his wife beforehand or tried to find a compromise instead of making a demand. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the situation isn't entirely one-sided. The wife's parents' language preference is important, so the author's request might not be fair.\n"
