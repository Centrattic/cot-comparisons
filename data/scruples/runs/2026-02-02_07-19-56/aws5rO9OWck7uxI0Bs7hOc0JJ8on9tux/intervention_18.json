I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's upset because his wife and her parents are speaking French during dinners, which he can't understand. He felt excluded and asked to not come to those dinners if he can't understand the conversation, but his wife got irritated and said it's disrespectful for him not to show up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The husband is not at fault for feeling left out, right? His wife and her parents are using a language he doesn't know, which makes him feel isolated. But the wife's family's comfort in French is also a valid point. The husband's request seems reasonable\u2014he doesn't want to be in an environment where he can't participate or understand the conversation. However, the wife is pushing back, saying it's disrespectful to not attend. \n\nHmm, but is the husband in the wrong for setting this boundary? If he's uncomfortable, it's okay for him to express that. On the other hand, the wife's family might not be able to switch to English easily. Maybe the husband could have approached it more calmly, as he mentioned he could have. But the core issue is whether his request is unreasonable. The wife's argument is that it's disrespectful not to meet her parents, but if the environment is making him feel excluded, is that a valid reason for him not to attend? \n\nI think the key here is mutual respect and finding a compromise. The husband isn't forcing his wife to switch languages, just asking for a choice not to attend if he can't engage. The wife might need to acknowledge his feelings and maybe find a way for the family to include him, like translating key parts or having some time in English. However, if the family is only comfortable in French, maybe the husband has to accept that or attend but not participate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not necessarily. He's expressing his discomfort, which is valid. But maybe the way he approached it could be improved. The wife might also need to be more understanding. So, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a cultural expectation where attending family dinners is a must, regardless of language. If that's the case, the husband's request might be seen as inconsiderate. But since the post says he's not trying to force them to speak English, just not attend if it's uncomfortable, I think he's within his rights. So answer B.\n"
