I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset that his wife's family only speaks French during dinners when he's present, even though he doesn't understand it. He asked to not attend those dinners or for them to speak English, but his wife got irritated and he's now questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author is a multilingual person, and he's not trying to force any language on his wife. The issue here is communication during family dinners. The wife's parents are only using French, which he can't understand, leading to confusion and feeling excluded. He expressed his discomfort and requested either not to attend or have the conversation in English. His wife's response was that the parents aren't comfortable with English and that not attending would be disrespectful. The author feels he shouldn't be in that situation but acknowledges he could have been calmer.\n\nNow, considering cultural aspects and family dynamics. In many bilingual or multilingual families, especially when elders are involved, they might prefer their native language for comfort or because they're not fluent in another. The wife's parents might not be comfortable switching to English, which is understandable. The author's request is about his own comfort and inclusion. However, the wife is mediating between her parents and her partner. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author has a right to feel included in family gatherings, especially since he's part of the wife's life. However, the parents' comfort in their native language is also valid. The author's approach was to ask not to attend, which might seem like avoiding the situation rather than finding a compromise. The wife's irritation could stem from feeling caught between her parents and her spouse's needs. The author could have approached the situation by discussing with his wife first, perhaps finding a middle ground, like having part of the conversation in English or learning some French to better participate. But he directly asked to not come, which might come off as abrupt. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that showing up shows respect to her parents, which is a common cultural expectation. The author's request to avoid attending might be seen as disrespectful to her parents if done without considering their feelings. However, the author's feelings of exclusion are also valid. The key points here are communication and compromise. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but his approach could have been more considerate and collaborative. The wife's reaction of irritation suggests that the method of communication was an issue. The author could have been more understanding of his wife's position and her parents' comfort, while also expressing his own needs in a way that seeks mutual understanding. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how he approached the situation.\n"
