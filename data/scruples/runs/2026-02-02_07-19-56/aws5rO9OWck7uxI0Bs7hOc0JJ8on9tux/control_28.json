I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present because he doesn't understand it. The wife and the author both speak multiple languages, so it's not about forcing English. The author feels left out when the wife's parents speak French, leading to confusion and frustration. He asked to not attend those dinners if he can't understand the conversation, but his wife got irritated and said they should still come. The author is now wondering if he's wrong for feeling that way.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are communication, cultural considerations, and mutual respect in a relationship. The author's concern is valid because being in a situation where he can't understand the conversation could make him feel excluded. However, the wife's perspective is that her parents are uncomfortable with English, so they naturally speak French among themselves. The author is asking for a change in their family's communication, which might be a stretch depending on the context.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to find a balance where both feel comfortable. The wife's parents might not be able to switch to English easily, especially if they're more proficient in French. The author's request to not attend the dinners if he can't understand the conversation is about his comfort, but it's also possible that the wife could mediate by translating or encouraging her parents to speak English when the author is present. However, the author's approach of asking to not attend might come off as avoiding the situation rather than seeking a compromise. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also important. She might feel that her family's language and culture are important, and she might not want to impose on her parents to change their communication style. The author's tone when he made the request could have been part of the issue, as he acknowledges he could have been calmer. But the core issue is about mutual understanding. The author isn't forcing anyone to speak English, just expressing his discomfort. \n\nIn terms of cultural sensitivity, it's important to respect the wife's family's comfort with their native language. However, the author also has a right to feel included in his wife's family gatherings. The solution might involve the wife being a bridge between both parties, perhaps translating key parts or having a private discussion with her parents about the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not demanding the family to speak English but just wants to be included, then he's not entirely wrong. However, his approach of asking to not attend might be seen as avoiding the problem. The wife's parents can't be expected to change their communication style, but the wife could help facilitate better inclusion. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe he should have approached the situation differently, perhaps by discussing it with his wife first to find a middle ground. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since he can't understand French and the family is comfortable in French, asking them to switch isn't feasible. However, expecting the wife to manage the communication or to limit his presence if he can't be included is a different matter. The author's right to feel included is valid, but the solution might require more compromise from both sides. The wife's irritation might stem from feeling that her family's language is being criticized, even indirectly. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his discomfort, but his approach could be improved. The wife might need to take steps to include him, like translating or setting expectations with her parents. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for both parties to adjust.\n"
