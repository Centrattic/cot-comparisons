I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present. He can't understand French and felt excluded. He asked to not attend those dinners, but his wife got upset, saying it's disrespectful not to show up. The author is now wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's being excluded from the conversation because he doesn't speak French. He's trying to be part of the family gatherings but feels left out. It's understandable that he's frustrated. On the other hand, the wife's side is that her parents are more comfortable in French and that not attending might be seen as disrespectful. Cultural and family traditions can be important, and expecting immediate family to switch languages might not be feasible, especially if they're older and more comfortable in their native tongue.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author isn't asking his wife to stop speaking French with her family in general, but specifically when he's at the table. The wife's parents aren't fluent in English, so they might prefer to speak French to communicate effectively. The author feels left out, which is a valid feeling, but the wife's perspective is about respecting her family's comfort and cultural background. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Maybe not entirely. He's trying to bridge a gap to participate in family events. However, his approach might have been too abrupt. He could have approached the situation more sensitively, perhaps suggesting a compromise, like having some time in French and some in English, or maybe arranging a separate time where he can interact with her parents in a way he's comfortable with. But does that mean he's in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe wife is also in a tough spot; she has to balance her husband's needs with her family's preferences. Her reaction might have been irritation because she feels her family's needs are being prioritized over her relationship with her husband. However, the author's request isn't unreasonable. It's about mutual respect and finding a middle ground. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his need to feel included. However, he might have handled it better. The wife's parents' comfort in French is also a valid point. So, neither side is entirely at fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, and based on the scenario, it seems like it's a misunderstanding rather than a clear wrong. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but there's room for both to adjust and communicate better.\n"
