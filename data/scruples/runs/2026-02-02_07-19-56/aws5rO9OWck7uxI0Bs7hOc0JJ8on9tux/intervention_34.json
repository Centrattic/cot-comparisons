I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author asked his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinner because he doesn't understand it, and he felt excluded. The wife got irritated, and now he's questioning if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his wife both speak multiple languages, so it's not about enforcing a specific language. The issue is during family dinners where the wife's parents only speak French, making him feel left out. He asked to not attend these dinners if he can't understand the conversation. The wife argues that her parents aren't comfortable with English and that he should still come. He feels he shouldn't have to be in a situation where he can't participate, but the wife called him selfish.\n\nNow, considering cultural and familial dynamics. It's common for families to speak their native language among themselves, especially if they're not fluent in another. The parents might prefer French for comfort or to communicate effectively. The author's request is about not attending if he can't understand, which might be seen as a valid request to avoid feeling excluded. However, expecting the family to switch languages for him might be a stretch, especially if they're not comfortable with English.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the situation differently. Instead of asking to opt out, maybe he could have learned some French phrases or tried to engage in other ways. But his request to not attend isn't entirely unreasonable if he's uncomfortable being excluded. The wife's parents might not have the obligation to accommodate his language preference if it's their home and they're with their own family.\n\nThe wife's response that it's disrespectful not to attend might be culturally influenced. In some cultures, showing up for family events is expected regardless of language barriers. However, the author's feelings of being excluded are also valid. The conflict here is between his comfort and the family's language preferences.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's expressing his needs, but he could have handled it more sensitively. The wife's irritation might stem from feeling that he's dismissing her family's culture. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's asking for a reasonable accommodation (not attending if he can't understand), but there's nuance here. However, the key is whether he's being selfish. If the request to not attend is about his own discomfort rather than a broader issue, that could be seen as selfish. But if it's about being included in the conversation, that's different. Since the situation is that the family isn't switching languages, and he's not asking them to, just not attend, I think B is the answer.\n"
