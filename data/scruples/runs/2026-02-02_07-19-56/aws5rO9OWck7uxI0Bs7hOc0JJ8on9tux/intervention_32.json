I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife's family to speak English during dinner. The author speaks multiple languages but not French, and he felt left out during the dinner when they switched to French. He asked not to attend those dinners or have them speak English, which upset his wife. The wife said her parents aren't comfortable in English, so the author should still come. He's upset because he doesn't want to be in that uncomfortable situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. The wife's family has a right to speak their native language, especially in their home or during family gatherings. The author's request might be seen as a demand for them to accommodate him, which could be a bit much. However, the author is also in a relationship with the wife, so he has a right to feel included. But how does that balance?\n\nThe author's tone when he asked to not attend might have been abrupt, which could have contributed to the wife's irritation. Maybe he could have approached it differently, like asking the wife to translate or find a middle ground. However, his main concern is valid\u2014he's being excluded from family time, which is important in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's parents are from a French-speaking background, so using French is natural for them. Insisting they switch languages might be seen as disrespectful to their heritage. The wife might feel caught between her family's comfort and her partner's needs. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it more sensitively. The key points are the balance between cultural respect and the author's need to feel included. However, the author did make a request that's not easy for the wife's family to comply with. The wife's argument that her parents aren't comfortable with English is valid, so the author's demand to have them speak English might be unrealistic. Therefore, the author is partly at fault for not considering the wife's family's comfort and not finding a compromise. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's asking for a change that's hard for the family to make and didn't approach it calmly enough.\n"
