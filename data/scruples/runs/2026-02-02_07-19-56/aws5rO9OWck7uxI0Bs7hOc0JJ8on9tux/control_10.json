I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author is married to a French-speaking person and is upset because her parents only spoke French during dinner when he was present. He doesn't know French, couldn't understand the conversations, and felt left out, especially when they laughed in French. He asked her not to come to those dinners if they can't speak English, but she got irritated and said her parents aren't comfortable with English. He feels it's a problem because he doesn't want to be in a situation where he can't understand the conversation, but she called him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his wife both speak multiple languages, so the issue isn't about her speaking French in general. The problem is that when he's present, the family switches to French, excluding him. That's a common issue in multilingual families where the non-native member feels left out. The author's frustration is understandable. He's part of the family now, and being excluded from conversations can make someone feel like an outsider, even if they respect the language and culture.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the wife's parents are not comfortable with English. Maybe they're more fluent in French or just prefer it when they're with family. The author's solution was to suggest not attending the dinners, but that might be seen as avoiding the situation rather than trying to adapt. However, he did ask for a solution that includes him, like speaking English at the table. The wife's response was that it's disrespectful not to show up. But the author is also being respectful by wanting to be part of the conversation.\n\nNow, the author admitted he could have been calmer, so maybe his tone was an issue. However, the core request\u2014wanting to be included by speaking English when he's present\u2014is reasonable. It's about mutual respect and inclusion. The wife might need to mediate or find a compromise, like having some time in French and some in English. But the author isn't forcing them to speak English; he's just asking to be included when he's there. \n\nIs it selfish? If he's asking to be included, that's not selfish. Selfish would be if he wanted them to switch to English regardless of their comfort. But he's willing to not attend if they can't, which is a middle ground. The wife might not have considered his feelings enough. So the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe both could work on communication. The answer is B.\n"
