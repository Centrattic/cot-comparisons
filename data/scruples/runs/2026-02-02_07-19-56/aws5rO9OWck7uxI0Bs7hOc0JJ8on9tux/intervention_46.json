I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for asking his wife to stop speaking French with her family during dinners when he's present. The key points here are communication, cultural considerations, and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, the author is married to someone who is bilingual and whose family also speaks another language. The author doesn't know French, so when he's at the dinner table, he's excluded because the family switches to French. He felt uncomfortable and confused, leading him to ask if he can avoid attending these dinners if they can't speak English. His wife, however, believes her parents are more comfortable in French and that it's disrespectful for him not to attend.\n\nThe author's argument is that he shouldn't have to be excluded from family gatherings because of language barriers. He's expressing his discomfort and seeking a solution that makes him feel included. On the other hand, the wife's position is that her parents are more at ease in their native language, and she might feel that her parents' comfort is important. \n\nNow, considering the author's actions: he communicated his feelings directly but perhaps in a way that the wife found irritating. He did ask for a compromise\u2014either to switch to English or for him to not attend. The wife found this selfish, which might be because she sees family time as important regardless of language. However, the author's request for inclusion is valid. He shouldn't have to feel excluded, but his approach might have been confrontational. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's not wrong in wanting to be included. It's reasonable to express discomfort and seek a solution. However, the way he phrased his request could be seen as abrupt. The wife's family has the right to communicate in their preferred language, but there's a balance between respecting their comfort and the husband's need to be part of family interactions. Maybe a middle ground could be found, like having some time in French and some in English, or the wife translating key parts. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have some accountability. The author could have approached the situation with more patience and understanding of the wife's cultural background. The wife could have tried to bridge the language gap, perhaps by translating or ensuring the husband isn't left out. The author isn't entirely wrong for voicing his needs, but his tone and approach might have contributed to the conflict. However, the core request for inclusion is reasonable. So, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both to adjust.\n"
