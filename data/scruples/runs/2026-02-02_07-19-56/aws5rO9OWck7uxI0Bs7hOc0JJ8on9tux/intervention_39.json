I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author's wife's family speaking French during dinners when he's present, and he's upset because he can't understand. He asked her to stop, but she said her parents aren't comfortable with English. The author is frustrated and felt disrespected when he couldn't understand the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural aspects. Families often speak their native language among themselves, especially if they're comfortable with it. The wife's parents might be more at ease in French, so expecting them to speak English could be challenging for them. The author is asking his wife to intervene, which might put her in a tough spot since she's part of that family.\n\nThe author's main issue is not understanding the conversation and feeling excluded. However, he's not asking for the wife to translate or for the family to accommodate his language barrier. Instead, he's asking them to switch languages, which might not be feasible for the parents. That could be seen as a bit selfish, considering their comfort and communication style.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that being part of the family, he has a right to be included. But the wife's parents aren't his own, so expecting them to adjust their language for him might be too much. The author could have approached this by asking for translations or engaging in other ways instead of demanding a language switch.\n\nThe wife's reaction is irritation, which makes sense because she's caught between her parents' comfort and her husband's needs. The author could have handled it more calmly, as he admits. But is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a balance between respecting family traditions and personal comfort. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to understand, but his approach could be seen as selfish. However, the wife's parents aren't obligated to switch languages, so the author's request might be unreasonable. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
