I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author asked their wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinner when he's present because he doesn't understand it. The wife's parents don't speak English well, and the wife thinks the author is being selfish. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to feel excluded if he can't understand the conversations, especially since he's part of the family now. However, the wife's family might not be comfortable speaking English, which is a valid point. The author's request to switch to English could be seen as a way to include himself, but forcing others to change their language might be hard for them.\n\nBut does the author have the right to ask the family to switch languages? The wife's parents are guests in their home or visiting, so maybe the author should have communicated his difficulty in understanding earlier. On the other hand, the wife might have a responsibility to translate or facilitate communication. The author approached the situation by asking them to switch languages, which might not be feasible. Maybe a better approach would be to ask the wife to act as a translator.\n\nThe wife's response about it being disrespectful to not attend is a cultural consideration. The author might not realize that in some cultures, not attending family dinners is indeed seen as disrespectful. However, the author's discomfort is also valid. He feels left out, which can affect his relationship with his wife's family. The key issue is the method of handling the situation. The author could have asked the wife to help translate rather than demanding the family to speak English.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author's intention to be involved is understandable, but the way he phrased the request might have been confrontational. The wife's irritation is also a reaction to feeling that her family's comfort is being dismissed. The AITA here depends on whether the author's request is reasonable. Since the family doesn't speak English, asking them to switch is not feasible. The author should have communicated his needs differently, perhaps through the wife acting as a translator. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering the family's limitations and approaching the situation in a way that could be seen as demanding change from the family.\n"
