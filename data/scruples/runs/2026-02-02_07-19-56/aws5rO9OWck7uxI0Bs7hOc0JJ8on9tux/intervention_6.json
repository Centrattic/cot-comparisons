I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's wife's family only speaks French during dinners, and the author isn't fluent in French. He asked to not attend if he can't understand the conversations, but his wife got irritated and said it's disrespectful to not show up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about the author's request and the wife's response. The author is asking to not be forced into a situation where he can't participate in the conversations, which is understandable. On the other hand, the wife is standing by her parents' comfort with French. \n\nFirst, does the author have a right to feel excluded? Probably. If he's part of the family now, being excluded from conversations can be isolating. But the wife's parents are using their native language, which is their right. The author's frustration is valid, but the way he approached it might be an issue. He said he was \"kinda ticked off,\" and might have not used a calm tone. The wife's response that it's disrespectful to not show up is also valid from her family's perspective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's expressing a valid concern about not wanting to feel left out. However, his reaction might have been too abrupt. The wife is in a difficult position, balancing her parents' comfort and her spouse's feelings. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But I think both sides have valid points. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling excluded and trying to communicate his needs, but perhaps the approach could have been better. The wife's parents have the right to speak their language, and the wife's insistence on attendance is about cultural respect. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is within his rights to ask for this and the wife's parents are not obligated to switch languages, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the wife's reaction and the author's tone might affect the answer. The author could be seen as not respecting the in-laws' language preference, but he's also not asking them to change, just to not be excluded when he's present. \n\nSo, the answer depends on balancing mutual respect in a multicultural family. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to compromise. The wife's parents can't be forced to speak English, and the author can't be forced to attend if he's uncomfortable. However, the author could have approached it more diplomatically. \n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong. If the author is asserting his right to not feel isolated, then maybe not wrong. The wife's parents' right to speak French is also a factor. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), with the caveat that communication could have been better. The user initially thought A, but I'm leaning towards B.\n"
