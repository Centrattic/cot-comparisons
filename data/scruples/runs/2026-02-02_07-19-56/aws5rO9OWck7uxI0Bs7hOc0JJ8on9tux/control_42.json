I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife's family to speak English during dinners when he can't understand French. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he and his wife both speak multiple languages, so it's not about enforcing a single language. The issue is that during family dinners, the wife's parents only speak French, which he can't understand. He felt excluded and wanted to stop attending if they can't switch to English.\n\nThe wife's side is that her parents aren't comfortable with English. So, maybe there's a language barrier there. The author felt it was unfair to be in a situation where he can't participate, leading him to ask to not attend. The wife got irritated and called him selfish. \n\nNow, considering cultural aspects. In some cultures, it's common for families to speak their native language at home, even with visitors. The author might be in a minority here, but his feelings are valid. Being unable to understand the conversation can be isolating. However, the wife's parents might not see the problem, thinking it's normal.\n\nThe author's request is about his own comfort and inclusion. He's not forcing anyone to change, just asking for a more inclusive environment when he's present. But the wife is mediating between her parents and her husband's needs. Her irritation might stem from feeling torn between her family's traditions and her husband's feelings.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's not forcing them to speak any language, just expressing his need to understand. It's reasonable to want to participate in the conversation during family dinners. However, he might not have considered that the parents might not be able to switch languages easily. His tone was \"kinda ticked off,\" which might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's parents not being comfortable in English is a valid point. Maybe they can't switch, and the wife is caught in the middle. The author's solution of not attending if they can't speak English is a bit extreme, but it's a way to set a boundary. \n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both sides have some responsibility. The author could have approached it more calmly, as he admitted. The wife might need to find a middle ground, like having parts of the conversation in English or using translation. But the author isn't entirely wrong in wanting to be included. So, probably the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The key is whether his request is reasonable. Since he's not imposing a language but asking for inclusion, he's in a valid position. The wife's parents' refusal isn't his fault. So the answer is B.\n"
