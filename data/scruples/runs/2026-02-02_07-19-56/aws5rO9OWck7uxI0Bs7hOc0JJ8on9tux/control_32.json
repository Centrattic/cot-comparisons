I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present. The husband doesn't know French, so he's left confused and uncomfortable when they speak in French. He asked to not attend the dinners if he can't understand, but his wife got irritated and said it's disrespectful not to show up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he's trying to communicate his discomfort. He's not asking them to speak English all the time, but when he's there, he wants to understand. It's reasonable for him to feel left out if they're speaking a language he doesn't know. On the other hand, the wife's side: her parents are not comfortable with English. It's their right to speak their native language. The husband's request to not attend might come off as self-centered because the wife's parents didn't ask him to come, but he's joining because he wants to be part of the family.\n\nThe user says the husband could have taken a calmer tone, which suggests his approach might have been a bit abrupt. However, the core issue is that he's not the one causing the language barrier\u2014his wife's parents are. It's not about making them speak English, but about his inclusion in the conversation. The wife's response that it's disrespectful not to attend might be a valid point, but maybe there's a middle ground, like having a translator or setting expectations beforehand.\n\nThe husband isn't wrong for wanting to understand the conversation when he's part of the dinner. He's not forcing anyone to speak English, just expressing his need to be included. The wife's reaction of calling him selfish might be an overreaction. So, the husband isn't in the wrong for making his feelings known, even if his timing or tone could be improved. The answer would likely be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
