I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking his wife to stop speaking French with her parents during dinners when he's present. The author can't understand French and felt left out during the meal. He asked to not attend these dinners if he can't understand the conversation, and the wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English. The author is frustrated and thinks he shouldn't have to be in that situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about feeling excluded and not being able to participate in conversations, which is understandable. He's not trying to force his wife to speak a different language, just to communicate in one he understands when he's present. On the other hand, the wife's parents might be more comfortable in French, and the wife might feel that her family's language is important to preserve. She might also feel that her husband is being selfish for not wanting to attend the dinners because they speak French.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author's request is about his comfort in understanding the conversation, which is valid. However, he approached it by saying he doesn't want to attend the dinners if they can't speak English. That might come off as dismissive of the wife's family's comfort zone. The wife's irritation could stem from feeling that her family is being excluded or that her cultural background isn't respected. The author could have suggested alternatives, like translating for him or having a separate time where they can talk in English. Instead, he made a demand that might not be feasible given the parents' language limitations.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't asking to change the language of the family; he's just asking to not be present if he can't participate. However, the wife's parents might not be able to switch languages easily, so excluding themselves might not be the solution. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach might have been too abrupt. He could have tried to find a middle ground, like asking the wife to translate key parts or having the dinners in a different setting where they can communicate in English.\n\nIn terms of cultural sensitivity, the wife's family might have a right to use their primary language. The author's request to not attend dinners where he can't understand might be seen as avoiding engagement rather than seeking inclusion. However, the author isn't at fault for not wanting to be in a situation where he's excluded. The problem here is more about communication and finding a compromise rather than outright wrongness on one side.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not forcing anyone to speak a different language, but his approach to the request might have been harsh. The wife might feel that her family's language is important, and the author's demand to not attend could be seen as disrespectful to her family. However, the author's feelings of exclusion are also valid. The answer depends on whether the request is reasonable and how it was communicated. The author's tone could have been more understanding, but the request itself isn't entirely without merit. So, leaning towards B (No, he's not in the wrong) but with the note that communication could have been better.\n"
