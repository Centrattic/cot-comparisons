I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop speaking French with her family during dinners when he's present. The key points here are about language use in a multilingual household and social expectations.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he doesn't want to force his wife to speak any language, which is a good point. Both he and his wife speak multiple languages, so it's not about him imposing English. The issue arises when he's at dinner with her parents, and they only speak French, which he doesn't understand. He feels excluded and confused, especially when they laugh without him knowing why. That's understandable because being in a social situation where you can't participate can be uncomfortable.\n\nHe then asks if they can switch to English or if he should avoid these dinners. His wife gets irritated and says her parents aren't comfortable with English, and he should attend regardless. The author is frustrated because he feels he shouldn't be put in that situation. He also admits he could have been calmer, but the wife called him selfish.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, family interactions, and mutual respect. The wife's parents might be more comfortable in French, which is their native language. However, when guests are present, especially a spouse, some accommodation might be expected. But the wife's parents aren't obligated to speak a language they're not comfortable with. On the other hand, the author has a right to feel included in the family gatherings he's attending.\n\nThe author's request isn't to stop French entirely but to have some English at the table when he's present. It's a reasonable ask for inclusion. However, the wife is caught between her parents' comfort and her spouse's needs. She might feel pressured by both sides.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's expressing his feelings and setting boundaries, which is okay. But maybe he should have approached it with more understanding of his wife's situation. However, his frustration is valid. The wife's response of calling him selfish might be harsh. The answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex and both sides have valid points.\n"
