I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author asked his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present, even though he doesn't know the language. The wife's parents are only comfortable in French, so the author's request might be problematic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's wife and he both speak multiple languages, so it's not a language barrier between them. However, the wife's parents are only comfortable in French. The author felt left out during a dinner because he couldn't understand the conversations, which led to confusion and frustration. He then asked not to attend future dinners if he can't understand the language or if they can't switch to English. The wife got irritated, saying the parents aren't comfortable with English, and the author was upset, thinking it's unfair.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. From the author's perspective, being in a situation where he can't participate or understand the conversation might be uncomfortable. But the wife's family has their own comfort zone in French. It's possible that the author is being selfish in his request, expecting others to change for his comfort. On the other hand, the author isn't asking the parents to switch entirely but to accommodate his presence. However, the wife's parents might not be able to do that. The author could try to learn French or engage in other ways, but he's asking them to change, which might not be fair. The wife might feel that her family's comfort is important, and the author's reaction was abrupt. So, maybe the author is in the wrong by not respecting the family's language preference and not approaching the situation with more understanding. The answer might be A.\n"
