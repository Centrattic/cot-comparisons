I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present. Both he and his wife are multilingual, so it's not about forcing an English-only rule.\n\nThe situation is that the author attended dinner with his wife's parents, who spoke French the whole time except for initial introductions. He felt left out because he doesn't know French and was confused when they laughed. After dinner, he asked if he could skip future dinners if he can't understand the conversation. His wife got irritated, saying her parents are uncomfortable with English, and he should still come. He's upset because he feels it's unfair, though he admits he could have been calmer. He's asking if he's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, consider cultural and familial aspects. Family members might prefer speaking their native language, especially if they're not comfortable with another. The wife's parents might be more at ease in French, and expecting them to switch could be a stretch, especially if they're not fluent in English. However, the husband is part of the family now, so his inclusion is important. \n\nThe husband's request to understand the conversation is reasonable. Feeling excluded and not being able to participate might affect his sense of belonging. However, his approach was to ask the wife to make her parents speak English, which might not be feasible. Instead of asking her to make them switch, maybe he could have tried learning some French or using translation tools. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also a point. She might feel protective of her parents' comfort. But her response of demanding the husband attend without considering his feelings could be part of the issue. The husband's frustration is understandable, but his tone and approach could have been more diplomatic. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't entirely wrong for wanting to be included, but his method might be problematic. The wife isn't wrong for standing by her parents' language preference. However, the husband's request to avoid the dinners if he can't understand might be seen as reasonable, especially if he feels alienated. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but there's room for both sides. The key points are mutual understanding and finding a middle ground. The answer likely depends on whether the husband's request is seen as a valid need for inclusion or as being selfish. Since the wife's parents' language preference isn't the husband's fault, and the husband isn't forcing them to change, he might not be in the wrong. However, his approach could have been better. The wife's irritation might be justified if she feels her parents' comfort is important. \n\nHmm, so the answer might be B (No) because the husband is not in the wrong for wanting to understand and not feel excluded, but he could have handled it better. The wife's parents have their own preferences, but the husband's request isn't unreasonable.\n"
