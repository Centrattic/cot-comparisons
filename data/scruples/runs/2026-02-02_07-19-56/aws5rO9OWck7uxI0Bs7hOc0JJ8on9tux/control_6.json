I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present. The key points here are the languages involved and the dynamics between the couple and the wife's family.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he doesn't know French, which is the primary language the wife's parents use during dinners. He felt excluded and confused because he couldn't understand the conversations. He asked to not attend these dinners if he can't understand them, leading to conflict with his wife. The wife is upset because her parents aren't comfortable with English, and she thinks it's disrespectful for him not to attend. The author feels it's unfair to be in that situation and might have reacted more calmly.\n\nNow, considering cultural and relational aspects. The wife's family is using their native language, which is common and doesn't necessarily indicate exclusion. The author's request to not attend is about his comfort, but family gatherings can be important for building relationships. The wife's irritation might stem from feeling her family's practices are being challenged. The author's approach could come off as dismissive of her family's comfort, even if his feelings are valid.\n\nBut there's a balance. The author isn't asking for the language to be enforced; he just wants to understand the interactions when he's present. However, the wife's parents' discomfort with English is a factor. The author could explore other solutions, like learning French, using translation tools, or having separate time with the wife. But his demand to not attend at all might be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over marital and familial obligations. However, he's not wrong for wanting to feel included. The situation is complex with valid points on both sides. The answer would depend on whether the author's request is seen as reasonable or selfish in the context of the wife's family's dynamics.\n"
