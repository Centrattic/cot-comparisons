I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the wife's parents speaking French during dinner, which the author can't understand. The author asked his wife to stop, but she got irritated and told him he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because he can't participate in the conversation, which makes him feel excluded. He's asking for a simple request to speak English so he can be part of the dinner. That seems reasonable. On the other hand, the wife's parents are probably most comfortable speaking their native language, French. They might not be able to switch to English easily, especially if they're older or not fluent.\n\nThe author's wife is caught in the middle. She might feel that her parents' comfort and cultural background are important, but she also wants her husband to be included. The author's request isn't about forcing the family to speak English, but rather about making an effort to include him. However, if the wife's parents are genuinely uncomfortable with English, it's not their fault. \n\nBut the author has the option to ask the wife to translate or perhaps communicate in another way. He didn't say he asked for translation, just to stop speaking French. That might be the problem. If he's asking them to stop using French entirely without offering a middle ground, that could be seen as selfish. However, the wife's response that he's being selfish might be because she sees her parents' needs as important and thinks the husband should make an effort to learn French instead.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author might not be wrong in wanting to be included, but maybe he didn't consider the other side's perspective. He could have approached it differently, like asking the wife to help translate or suggesting a compromise. But the wife's reaction that he's being selfish might be unfair if the husband is just asking for inclusion. However, expecting the in-laws to speak English might be a tall order if they're not comfortable with it.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he has a right to feel included. But he could have handled it more sensitively. However, the wife's point about the parents not being comfortable with English is valid. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication from both sides. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A or B, I think B (not in the wrong) is the choice here because he's asking for a reasonable accommodation, even if the approach could be better. The main issue is mutual understanding, not one person being clearly wrong.\n"
