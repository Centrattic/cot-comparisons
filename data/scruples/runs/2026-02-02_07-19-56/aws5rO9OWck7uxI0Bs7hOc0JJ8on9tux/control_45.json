I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's wife speaking French with her parents during dinners, which he doesn't understand. He asked her to stop, but she got irritated and said he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author and his wife are bilingual, so it's not about forcing her to speak a specific language. He's okay with other languages, but during family dinners, they switch to French, leaving him out. He asked to not attend if he can't understand, which the wife dismissed as selfishness.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to communicate his discomfort. However, the wife's parents might not know English well. The author's request to opt out if he can't participate is reasonable, but his tone might have been an issue. The wife's parents' language barrier is a cultural aspect. The author could consider other ways to engage, like learning some French, but his request to leave isn't unreasonable. The wife's reaction might be harsh. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his needs, even if the approach could be better. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best solution. So, the author isn't wrong for wanting to communicate but could have handled it more calmly. So, answer B.\n"
