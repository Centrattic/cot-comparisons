I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners. The author's main issue is that he doesn't understand French, so when he's at the table, he's confused and can't participate. He asked if he can skip the dinners if he can't understand, but his wife got irritated and said they should come anyway. He's upset because he feels it's unfair, though he might have handled it better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural aspects. The wife's parents might be more comfortable in French, which is their native language. It's common for families to speak their native tongue at home, especially with close relatives. The author isn't forcing them to change their language; he's just uncomfortable not understanding. However, he's also part of the family now, so there's an expectation to participate in these gatherings even if it's not in his native language. \n\nThe wife's reaction is a point too. She might feel that her parents' comfort is important and that her husband should make an effort to be present regardless. But the author is also within his rights to feel left out and want to understand the interactions. Maybe there's a middle ground, like the wife translating key parts or the author learning some French. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for expressing his feelings. He's not demanding they stop speaking French entirely but is asking for accommodation so he can be part of the conversation. However, the wife's parents might not be able to switch to English, so the author's request might be unrealistic. He could have approached it more calmly, as he mentioned, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong for having the concern. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the wife's parents can't speak English, it's not their fault. The author's frustration is valid, but he also needs to respect the family's communication style. The wife's irritation might be because she feels her parents' preferences are being disregarded. The author isn't wrong for wanting to understand, but maybe he's not considering the family's limitations. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because his request is about inclusion, even if the solution isn't straightforward.\n"
