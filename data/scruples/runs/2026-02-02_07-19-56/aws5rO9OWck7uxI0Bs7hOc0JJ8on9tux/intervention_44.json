I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is married to a French person. Both he and his wife speak multiple languages, so it's not about enforcing English. The issue is that when they have dinner with her parents, they speak French the whole time except for the initial introductions. The author doesn't know French, so he feels left out when they laugh or talk among themselves. He asked if he can skip these dinners if he can't understand the conversation, but his wife got irritated and said her parents aren't comfortable with English. The author feels that he shouldn't have to be in a situation where he can't participate, but his wife called him selfish. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's a guest in his wife's family's home and he's not being included in the conversation. He's frustrated because he can't understand what's happening, leading to confusion and feeling excluded. He asked to not attend if he can't participate, which seems reasonable. However, his wife's side is that her parents are not comfortable with English, so switching to English might be hard for them. She might feel that the author is not respecting her family's language and culture by asking them to switch.\n\nBut wait, the author isn't asking her parents to speak English; he's asking if he can opt out of the dinners when he can't understand. That's different from demanding them to change their language. He's not trying to impose his language on them but wants to be included in the social setting. On the other hand, his wife might feel that he's using the language barrier as an excuse to avoid spending time with her parents, which could be seen as disrespectful to her family.\n\nHowever, the author's request seems reasonable. If someone is in a family gathering where the primary language is another one, and they can't participate in the conversation, feeling left out is understandable. The wife might need to find a middle ground, like designating some time in English or having him learn some French to ease the transition. But the author's approach was to ask to opt out, which might come off as dismissive of the family's time or his wife's feelings.\n\nBut the wife's response was to say it's disrespectful not to attend. That's a valid point because family dinners are important in many cultures. However, the author's frustration is also valid. There's a balance between cultural respect and personal comfort. The author could have approached this more diplomatically, perhaps by expressing his feelings of exclusion without making it a demand to leave. Maybe suggesting a compromise, like having part of the conversation in English or learning basic phrases, would have been better.\n\nIn the AITA context, the key is whether the author overstepped. He's not forcing his wife's family to speak English, just asking to not attend when he can't understand. That's a reasonable request, but his tone might have been harsh. However, the wife's reaction of calling him selfish might be an overreaction if the author is genuinely trying to participate. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but neither is he entirely right. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's request isn't unreasonable. His wife's family's language preference is valid, but the author has a right to feel included. The way he communicated his request could have been better, but the request itself isn't the issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
