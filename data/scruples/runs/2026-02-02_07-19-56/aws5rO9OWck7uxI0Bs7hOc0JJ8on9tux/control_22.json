She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the person who posted is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife's family speaking French during dinners, which he can't understand, and him asking them to switch to English or for him to not attend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband is asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French when he's present. He feels excluded because he doesn't know French. The wife's parents aren't comfortable with English, so they prefer to speak French. The husband's wife is irritated and calls him selfish. The husband is upset because he feels he shouldn't have to sit through a dinner where he can't participate.\n\nNow, considering cultural and familial aspects. The wife's family has the right to communicate in their preferred language, especially if they're not fluent in English. It's common for families to use their native language among themselves, especially in private settings like dinner. The husband is asking them to change their language during family time, which might be a big ask. The wife is caught between her husband's request and her family's comfort.\n\nThe husband's approach could be seen as a bit abrupt. He asked if he could stop attending the dinners if they don't speak English. That might come off as a ultimatum, which could explain the wife's irritation. However, he's also valid in feeling excluded. He's in a situation where he's part of the family but can't participate in the conversation, leading to frustration.\n\nThe key factors here are mutual respect and compromise. The husband's request is about feeling included, which is understandable. However, the wife's family's comfort in their native language is also valid. The husband might need to consider that his wife's parents might be more comfortable in French, especially if they're not fluent in English. \n\nThe wife's response that her parents aren't comfortable with English is a valid point. The husband's tone might have been a problem, but his underlying concern isn't entirely without merit. It's a balance between respecting family traditions and the husband's needs. \n\nPossible solutions could include the husband learning basic French to participate more, or setting aside time for family discussions in French and other times in English. The wife could also facilitate translation when necessary. However, the husband's request to not attend if they don't speak English might be too extreme, as it's his wife's family and cultural setting.\n\nIn terms of fault, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling excluded, but his approach might have been too direct. The wife's parents have the right to use their language, and the wife is caught in the middle. The husband's tone and the ultimatum could be where he's at fault, but his feelings of exclusion are valid. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is more on the side of the husband not being in the wrong entirely, but his approach could have been better. However, the wife's parents have a right to their language. The main issue is about expectations and communication. The husband's request is understandable, but the way he phrased it might have been too harsh. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
