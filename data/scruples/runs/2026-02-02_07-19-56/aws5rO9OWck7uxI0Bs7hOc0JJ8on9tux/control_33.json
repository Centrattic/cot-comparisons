I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife's family to speak English during dinners when he's present.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he doesn't want to force the wife to speak a specific language, and they both know multiple languages. So it's not about linguistic nationalism. The issue is that during dinner with the wife's parents, they only speak French, which he can't understand. He feels excluded and confused, especially when they laugh, not knowing what's happening. Then he asks to not attend those dinners if he can't understand, but the wife gets irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English. The author feels it's a setup and is upset, though he admits maybe his tone wasn't calm. The wife calls him selfish.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms: it's common for families to use their native language when together, especially if they're more comfortable in it. However, the author is part of the gathering now. The wife's parents might feel more at ease in French, but the author has a valid point about inclusion. On the other hand, the wife might think that her family's comfort is important, and maybe the author could learn French to bridge the gap. But the author isn't asking for that; he's asking to not attend if they can't speak English. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's expressing his need to feel included. However, his approach might be a bit abrupt by suggesting he doesn't have to attend. The wife's perspective is that attending is important for respect. The author could have tried a different approach, like setting boundaries gradually or discussing learning French. But the core issue is his right to feel included. So maybe neither is entirely wrong, but the author's method could be improved. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asking for a compromise that's reasonable (speaking English when he's present), and the wife's parents aren't comfortable, there's a cultural sensitivity here. The author's request might not be unreasonable, but the way he phrased it as not attending could come off as dismissive. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. So answer B.\n"
