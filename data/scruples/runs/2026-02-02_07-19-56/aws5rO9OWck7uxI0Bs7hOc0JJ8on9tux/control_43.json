I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is upset because their wife's family is speaking French during dinners, which he doesn't understand. He asked her to stop, but she got irritated and said he's being selfish. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a husband who's trying to communicate with his wife's family. If they're speaking a language he doesn't know, he's probably feeling left out or frustrated. He asked her to switch to English so he can participate, which seems reasonable. But the wife's argument is that her parents aren't comfortable with English, so he should still attend the dinners regardless. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to understand the conversation? If he's part of the family now, it's natural to want to be included. However, maybe he should have approached the situation differently. For example, maybe learning some French or asking the wife to translate when possible. But he didn't make her speak any language, which he explicitly states. That's a key point\u2014pressuring someone to change their language isn't the issue here. \n\nThe wife's parents might indeed feel more comfortable in French, but that doesn't mean the author can't express his need to understand. The author's request is about his own experience and inclusion. However, he also mentions threatening to not come to dinners if they don't speak English. That might come off as ultimatum-like, which could be why the wife felt he was being selfish. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong because his feelings are valid. But his approach could have been more considerate. The wife's parents' comfort is also important. The author could have asked for some translation or made an effort to learn, but he's not in the wrong for wanting to be part of the conversation. The key is balance. He's not forcing them to speak English, just asking for inclusion. The wife's reaction might be more about her own feelings about her parents' language use versus her husband's needs. \n\nI think the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. He's expressed his needs, and while he could have done it more calmly, his request is reasonable. The wife's parents' comfort in French is valid, but the author's inclusion is also important in a multicultural household. So there's a shared responsibility here, but the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
