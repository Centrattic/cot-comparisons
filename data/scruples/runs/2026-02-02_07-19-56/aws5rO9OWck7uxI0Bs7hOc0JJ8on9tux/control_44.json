I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author asked his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinner when he's present. The wife's parents speak French, which the author doesn't understand, and he felt left out and confused. He asked if he could avoid these dinners if they can't speak English, but the wife got irritated and said her parents aren't comfortable with English. The author is now wondering if he's being selfish.\n\nSo, first, I need to determine if the author's request is reasonable. The key points here are: the author is comfortable with multiple languages, the wife and he can speak multiple languages, but the family uses French, which he can't understand. The author wants to be included and understands the conversation, so he's asking for the family to switch to English when he's present. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's parents aren't comfortable with English. The wife is defending their language choice, which is common in multilingual families. The author is feeling excluded, which is a valid concern. However, the wife's family has their own comfort level with language, and the author is in a position where he can choose to attend or not, but he's asking the wife to mediate the situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing his wife to speak English, just asking for inclusivity when he's present. The wife's parents have the right to speak their preferred language, especially in a family setting. However, the author is also within his right to express his discomfort and request a change for his own comfort. The conflict arises from both parties' valid perspectives. \n\nThe author could have approached the situation more calmly, as he acknowledged, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong. The wife's parents not being comfortable in English is a significant factor. The author is asking for a compromise, which is reasonable, but the wife's parents might not be willing to switch. The author's frustration is understandable, but the wife's response about it being disrespectful not to attend might be a cultural consideration. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's asking for a reasonable accommodation, but the wife and her family have their own considerations. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
