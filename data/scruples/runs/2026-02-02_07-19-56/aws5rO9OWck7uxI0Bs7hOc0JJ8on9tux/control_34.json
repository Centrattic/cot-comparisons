I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where a husband is upset that his wife's family only speaks French during dinner, and he wants them to speak English so he can understand. The question is whether he's at fault for asking them to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband says he doesn't want to impose on the wife to speak a certain language, but he's uncomfortable not understanding the conversations. He had dinner with her parents and felt excluded because they spoke French the whole time. He asked to not come if he can't understand, and the wife got irritated, saying her parents aren't comfortable with English. He feels it's disrespectful to have to sit there confused and wants to not attend. The wife thinks he's being selfish.\n\nSo, the main issue is cultural and communication differences in a mixed-language marriage. The husband is asking for inclusion in the family gatherings, which is reasonable. But the wife's parents might not be fluent in English. Is the husband wrong to feel this way? Or is the wife's position that it's not her parents' fault?\n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's expressing a legitimate need to feel included. However, the way he approached it might be an issue. He mentioned he could have taken a calmer tone, which suggests he might have been abrupt. But the core request isn't unreasonable. On the other hand, the wife's parents might not have the ability to switch languages easily. The wife might be caught between her parents and her husband. \n\nBut the question is about the husband's actions. He's asking for a solution that allows him to feel part of the family. Since he's in a relationship with the wife, he's part of the family by marriage. Not being able to communicate can make someone feel excluded. So, the husband isn't wrong to want to be included. The wife might be right in that she can't force her parents to speak English, but she could try to mediate. The husband's request is about his own comfort, but it's not selfish if he's part of the family. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance. However, based on the information given, the husband's request is reasonable, so the answer is B.\n"
