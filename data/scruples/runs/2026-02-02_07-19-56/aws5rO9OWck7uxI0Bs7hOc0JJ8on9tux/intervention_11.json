I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife and her parents speaking French during family dinners, which he can't understand. He's upset about not being able to participate and asked to stop coming if they can't speak English. The wife got irritated, and he's now questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author acknowledges he doesn't want to force his wife to speak a particular language, which shows he's not trying to impose a language on her. He's concerned about not being included in the family gatherings because the conversations are in French. He asked to not attend if they can't speak English, which the wife finds disrespectful. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, being in a family setting where he can't understand the conversations might make him feel excluded. It's natural to want to be part of the interaction, especially when meeting in-laws. However, asking to not attend at all because he can't understand the language might come off as dismissive of the cultural aspect. The wife's parents might prefer speaking their native language, which is common in many families. The wife's irritation could be because she's caught between her parents' language preference and her husband's discomfort.\n\nThe author's response was to ask not to attend, which might be seen as avoiding the situation rather than trying to bridge the communication gap. Maybe there are other solutions, like learning some French, using translation, or engaging in other ways. But the author's frustration is valid; feeling left out can be hurtful. However, expecting the entire family to switch languages for him might be a tall order. The wife's point about it being disrespectful not to attend is also valid from her family's perspective.\n\nSo, where does the blame lie? The author's request to stop attending is extreme. It's understandable to feel excluded, but the solution he proposed might not be considerate of the family's dynamics. He could have asked to be included in another way instead of withdrawing. On the other hand, the wife's parents have the right to speak their language. The wife's reaction might be a defense of her family's traditions. The author's tone might have been too harsh, as he admits, which could have contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is to see if the person's actions are unreasonable or inconsiderate. The author wants to be included, but his solution was to avoid the situation. That might be seen as the problem. The wife is caught in the middle, and her irritation is a reaction to feeling that her husband is dismissing her family's language and culture. So, the author's fault is in how he approached the issue rather than the issue itself. Therefore, the answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong, but maybe he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his request to not attend is unreasonable, then he's in the wrong. If the conflict is more about communication styles, then maybe not. The answer depends on whether his action was the main issue. Since he's choosing to not attend rather than finding a middle ground, that's where he might be at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
