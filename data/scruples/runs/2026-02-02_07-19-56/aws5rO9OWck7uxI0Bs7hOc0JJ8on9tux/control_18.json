I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife speaking French with her family during dinners, which he can't understand. He felt excluded and asked to not come to future dinners if they can't speak English, but his wife was upset. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is married to a bilingual person. His wife's family uses French, a language he doesn't know. During a dinner, he felt left out because he couldn't participate in the conversation. He expressed his discomfort by saying he might stop attending if it continues. The wife's response was that her parents aren't comfortable with English and that it's disrespectful not to attend. The author feels his request is reasonable, but the wife thinks he's being selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here are cultural and language dynamics in a mixed-language marriage. The author isn't asking his wife to stop speaking French in general, just when he's present. He's not pushing for a specific language, just wants to be included when he's part of the family gathering. The wife's side is that her parents are more comfortable in French, which is their primary language. However, the author's presence at the dinner implies that there's some expectation of inclusion. \n\nI should consider if the author's request is reasonable. He's part of the marital relationship, so the wife might be expected to facilitate communication between her family and him. But at the same time, the parents' comfort in their native language is a valid point. The author's frustration comes from not being able to participate, which is understandable. The wife's irritation could be because she feels her family's language is being challenged or that her spouse is not making an effort. \n\nThe author's approach might have been abrupt. Instead of saying he might not come, maybe he could have discussed compromise, like having some time in English or learning basic French phrases. However, his request itself isn't unreasonable. It's about mutual respect and inclusion in his own wife's family gatherings. The wife's parents might not need to switch entirely to English, but some effort to include him would be considerate. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's parents not being comfortable with English isn't a flaw; they have the right to speak their language. The conflict arises from the expectation of the author to be included versus the family's comfort. The author's anger might stem from feeling excluded, but his wife might feel that the family's preferences are being disregarded. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing anyone to speak a language, just asking for inclusion when he's present. His request is about his own comfort and participation, which is valid. The wife's response that it's disrespectful to not attend might be an overgeneralization. The author's tone was maybe too harsh, but the underlying request isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
