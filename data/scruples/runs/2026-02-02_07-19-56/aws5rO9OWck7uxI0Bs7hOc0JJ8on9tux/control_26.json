I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners when he's present. He doesn't know French, so he's left confused and wants to avoid these dinners if he can't understand the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: his wife and he are multilingual, so he's not forcing her to speak any language. He's just uncomfortable not understanding what's being said when he's part of the meal. His request is about his own comfort and being included. But he asked to not attend the dinners if they can't speak English, which seems like a reasonable desire to not be excluded.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's side: her parents are uncomfortable with English. That's a valid point. They might feel more at ease in their native language, especially with family. The wife might be caught between her husband's wishes and her parents' comfort. She's trying to mediate here.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author's request isn't about changing the language of the family but about his own inclusion. However, the wife's parents have their own language preferences. The author might be in a position where he's trying to set a boundary for himself, which is okay. But maybe his approach was abrupt, like asking to not come to the dinners without considering alternatives first. He could have suggested other ways to bridge the language gap, like learning some French or having a translator. But he did mention he doesn't know French, so that's a factor.\n\nAlso, the wife is caught in the middle. She might feel that her family's comfort is important, but her husband's feelings matter too. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he approached it might have been harsh, leading to the wife getting irritated. Maybe he could have communicated his feelings more calmly first instead of immediately asking to stop attending.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing anyone to speak English, just expressing his discomfort. But pushing for exclusion from dinners because of language might not be fair, as the family's right to communicate in their own language is important too. However, he's also entitled to his own comfort. The answer might hinge on whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. If the wife's parents can't switch to English, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his need to be included, but perhaps he needs to find another way to handle it without excluding himself. But if he's insisting on English, that might not be feasible. The wife's response that the parents aren't comfortable with English is valid. So maybe the author's approach was a bit selfish, but not entirely wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing the language but asking for inclusion, maybe he's not wrong, but there's room for a better approach. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's advocating for his needs, but the situation requires compromise.\n"
