After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset that his wife's family only speaks French during dinner, which he can't understand, and he asked to not attend those dinners or have them switch to English. The wife got irritated and said he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main issue is that he's not part of the conversation because it's all in French, which he doesn't speak. He feels excluded and uncomfortable, especially when they laugh at something he doesn't understand. He's not asking the wife to stop speaking French entirely, just to switch to English during family dinners when he's present. But the wife's parents aren't comfortable with English, according to her. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's perspective is that her parents are not comfortable in English, so it's natural they speak French among themselves. The wife might feel that her husband is being selfish by expecting them to change their language, especially since he's not forcing her to speak a particular language. She also emphasizes that attending dinner is important for cultural respect and family obligations.\n\nThe author's tone when he asked his wife could be a factor. He mentions he was \"kinda ticked off,\" which might have come through in his request, making the wife defensive. However, his request is reasonable\u2014he wants to be included or not have to be in a situation where he can't participate. The wife's response that it's disrespectful not to attend might be a cultural expectation, but the author's discomfort is valid too.\n\nI need to weigh cultural sensitivity versus personal comfort. The wife's family has the right to speak their native language, and it's a common practice for families to use their heritage language. However, the author is also a part of the family dynamic now and has the right to feel included. Maybe a compromise would be better, like the wife translating key parts or the author learning some French. But the author's approach was to either not attend or have them switch to English, which might be too extreme. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The wife's family isn't obligated to switch languages, but the author's request isn't unreasonable. However, the author could have approached it more calmly and perhaps suggested learning the language or other ways to be included. His frustration might be justified, but the way he presented it could have been more considerate. So maybe the answer is a mix, but since the options are A (yes) or B (no), I have to choose. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because his feelings are valid, but he could have handled it better. However, the wife's family's right to speak their language is also valid. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
