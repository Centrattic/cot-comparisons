I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's wife's family speaking French during dinners, which he can't understand, and he asked if he can avoid these dinners. The author is confused and feels excluded, leading to a conflict with his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author isn't forcing the wife to speak any language, which he acknowledges. He's bilingual, so he can handle multiple languages. The issue is during family dinners where he's excluded because they speak French. He asked to not attend if he can't understand, but the wife says her parents aren't comfortable with English. The wife's perspective is about respect and family traditions, while the author feels his needs are being ignored.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing a valid concern about feeling excluded. However, asking to not attend family gatherings might be seen as avoiding the situation rather than finding a middle ground. The wife's parents might have a right to speak their native language, and the author could consider learning French or participating in other ways. On the other hand, expecting the family to switch languages for him isn't unreasonable either. The author's tone might have been harsh, but the underlying issue is valid. The wife's reaction of calling him selfish could be a point where she's not considering his feelings. So, is the author in the wrong? I think it's a bit of both. The author could have approached it more calmly, but the wife's family is using a language he doesn't know. Maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's trying to assert his needs, even if the approach could be better. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
