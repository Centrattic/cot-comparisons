I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for asking their wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinner. They can't understand French and felt left out, especially since the family was laughing and they didn't know what was happening. The wife's parents aren't comfortable in English, so she tells the husband it's disrespectful not to come. He feels it's unfair to be in that situation and got irritated.\n\nFirst, the husband's perspective: he's trying to communicate that he's uncomfortable not understanding the conversation. It's about feeling excluded. He's not asking the wife to stop speaking French entirely, just when he's present. But the wife sees it as selfish because her parents are not comfortable in English. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's side: she's respecting her parents' comfort zone. They might prefer French for their own ease. She's probably trying to maintain family traditions or comfort. But she's also pushing the husband to attend dinners where he can't participate, which might be a fair point. \n\nThe husband's request isn't about changing the family's language but about his own understanding. It's reasonable to want to be included in conversations at a dinner he's attending. The wife's parents might not know English, so maybe there's a middle ground. Like, maybe the wife can translate key parts or the parents could switch to English when the husband is present. However, if the parents are genuinely uncomfortable, that's a different issue. \n\nThe husband's approach might have been abrupt, but his underlying need is valid. He's not wrong for wanting to understand and participate. The wife's reaction that he's selfish might be because she's prioritizing her parents' comfort over his inclusion. But maybe she could find a way to bridge the gap. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? He's not demanding the wife to change, just asking for a more inclusive environment when he's there. The wife's parents' language preference is understandable, but the husband has a right to feel included. Therefore, the husband is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
