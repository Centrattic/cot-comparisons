I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinners, which he can't understand. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural aspect. The wife's parents might prefer speaking their native language, French, which is common in many families. It's a way to maintain their cultural heritage and comfort. The author is frustrated because he can't understand the conversation and feels left out.\n\nThe author's main point is that he doesn't want to attend dinners where he can't participate. He's not asking his wife to stop speaking French in general, just during these family meals when he's present. He did communicate his discomfort, and the wife felt it was disrespectful to avoid the dinners. \n\nNow, the wife's perspective: her parents might not be comfortable in English, so they default to French. She might feel that changing their language would make them uncomfortable or alienate them. However, the author feels excluded and is asking for a solution that allows him to be included, like having some English at the table. \n\nThe author's approach was a bit abrupt\u2014saying he doesn't want to come to dinners. Maybe a more constructive approach would be to suggest alternatives, like having some time in English or him learning French. But his request isn't unreasonable. It's about mutual respect and finding a middle ground. \n\nThe wife getting irritated and calling him selfish might indicate she didn't consider his feelings. However, family dynamics can be complex. The author isn't demanding a language change but a compromise. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's asking for a reasonable adjustment to include him in the family gatherings, which is a valid request. The wife's parents' comfort is important, but the author's feelings of exclusion are also valid. The answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
