I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's wife's family speaking French during dinner, which he doesn't understand. He asked her to stop, but she was upset, and now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't asking his wife to change her language with him; he's only objecting to her family speaking French during family dinners when he's present. He mentioned that he doesn't speak French and felt excluded during the dinner. He asked to not attend if he can't understand the conversation, but his wife thinks it's disrespectful for him not to attend. \n\nNow, evaluating the cultural aspect: The wife's parents might be more comfortable in French, which is common in multilingual families. The author's request to speak English at the table could be seen as a reasonable request for inclusion, especially since he's part of their family now. However, the wife's family might feel that switching to English is a burden if they are not comfortable with it. \n\nThe author's approach was to ask to avoid attending, which could be seen as avoiding the situation rather than trying to find a middle ground. Maybe he could have suggested a compromise, like having some time in French and some in English. On the other hand, his frustration is understandable because he felt excluded. \n\nThe wife's reaction was irritation, which might be because she feels caught between her family's comfort and her husband's feelings. She might believe that the family's language is a cultural norm and that her parents shouldn't have to change for him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing anyone to speak a language but is asking for his own comfort. However, expecting the in-laws to switch languages entirely might be unrealistic. Maybe there's a middle ground, like learning some French or having part of the conversation in English. The author's approach of not attending could come off as dismissive of the wife's family. So he might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for a more collaborative solution. \n\nBut according to the options, it's A or B. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing them to change their language but is asking for his own needs to be met, which is a reasonable request, he's not in the wrong. However, his method of asking (maybe too bluntly) could have contributed. But the core issue is his request for inclusion. So the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
