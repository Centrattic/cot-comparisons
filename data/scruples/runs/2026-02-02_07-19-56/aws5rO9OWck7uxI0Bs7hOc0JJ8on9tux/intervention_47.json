I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to speak English during family dinners. The author's wife's parents speak French, which he doesn't understand. He felt left out and asked to not attend the dinners if they can't speak English. The wife got upset and said it's disrespectful for him not to come.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to communicate his discomfort about not understanding the conversation, which is understandable. But the wife's parents are probably more comfortable in French. The author's main issue is being excluded from the conversation, which is valid. However, is it fair to demand that they switch to English?\n\nThe author mentions they both speak multiple languages, so maybe he could try learning some French to bridge the gap. But he's not asking her to speak another language, just that her family does. The wife's parents might feel it's their home and they should be comfortable in their own language. The author wants to include himself in the conversation, but maybe there's a middle ground. \n\nThe author's approach of asking not to attend the dinners if they can't switch to English might be seen as a bit abrupt. Maybe he could have suggested learning some phrases or having a translator. However, feeling like he's being excluded is valid. The wife's reaction might be based on her parents' feelings versus her husband's needs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a cultural and communication issue. The author isn't wrong to want to understand, but maybe his approach was a bit harsh. Alternatively, the wife's parents have the right to speak their native language. The author might benefit from learning the language or using other methods to engage, rather than backing out. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting to understand, but his demand to leave might have been a bit extreme. The wife's perspective is also valid in protecting her family's comfort. So maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he could have approached it differently. But I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, maybe B (no) because his feelings are valid. Hmm. Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the situation. The author's main issue is being excluded, which is a valid concern. But demanding that the family switch to English might be too much. So maybe A is correct.\n"
