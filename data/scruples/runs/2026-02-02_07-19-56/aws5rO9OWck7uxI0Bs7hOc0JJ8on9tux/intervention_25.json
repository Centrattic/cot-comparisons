I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author asked his wife to stop her family from speaking French during dinner when he's present. He doesn't know French, and he felt excluded because they were laughing and he couldn't understand. He then asked not to attend those dinners if he can't understand, but his wife got irritated and said it would be disrespectful to not show up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is feeling left out and maybe uncomfortable not understanding the language. He's made a reasonable request to communicate in a language he knows, which is English. But his wife's parents are not comfortable with English, so they prefer to speak French. That seems like a cultural or personal preference. \n\nThe wife's point is that it's disrespectful for the author to not attend the dinners. But the author is also entitled to feel comfortable in his own home and during these family gatherings. However, the author's approach was to ask her to make her parents stop speaking French, which might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe suggesting a compromise, like having a French-English translator app or learning some phrases, would have been better. \n\nBut the author didn't ask his wife to speak English to him; he asked her to stop her family from speaking French when they're together. So it's a request to include him in the conversation. The wife's parents might not want to learn English, but maybe the wife could have facilitated communication. However, the wife's reaction was to call him selfish, which isn't helpful either. \n\nIs it the author's fault for feeling excluded? Or is it the wife's for not finding a way to make her parents communicate in a way that includes him? The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since he's in a relationship with her, he's part of her family now. It's reasonable to expect some effort to include him in family dinners. On the other hand, the parents might have their own comfort zones. \n\nThe author could have approached it more calmly, as he admitted, but the core issue is valid. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The wife's parents might need to make an effort, but the wife could have tried to mediate better. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's request is reasonable, though his tone could have been better. The wife's parents might need to adjust, but the author's feelings are valid.\n"
