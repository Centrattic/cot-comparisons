I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong (AITA). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband is asking his wife to stop speaking French with her family during dinners when he's present. He doesn't know French and feels excluded. He's not trying to force her to speak another language, just wants to understand the conversations. He mentioned that he asked to not attend the dinners if they can't switch to English, but his wife got irritated and said it's disrespectful for him to not show up. He's frustrated and thinks he shouldn't have to be in that situation, though he acknowledges he could have been calmer.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the wife's family is speaking their native language, which is a cultural and personal right. It's common for families to speak their first language at home, especially if they're more comfortable in it. The wife might be caught between her husband's feelings and her family's comfort. The husband's request is about communication and inclusion, which is valid because he's part of the family now. However, he's asking for a change in the family's conversational language, which might be seen as imposing his needs on them.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is also trying to integrate into his wife's family. If he's not part of the dinner conversation, he might feel alienated. But does he have a right to expect the family to switch languages for his benefit? It's a delicate balance between respecting cultural practices and the husband's desire to be included. The wife's family's comfort in their native language is important, but so is the husband's ability to participate in family gatherings without feeling excluded.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The husband's request is understandable, but the way he asked (by potentially threatening to not attend) might have been abrupt. However, his wife's response was to dismiss his feelings as selfish, which is not helpful. The husband's frustration is valid if he's being excluded, but the wife's family's language use is also their right. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's expressing a legitimate need to be included. However, the wife and her family also have their own cultural practices to respect. The issue might be more about how they're handling the communication rather than one side being entirely at fault. But since the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether his request is reasonable. Since he's not forcing a language change but wants to understand the conversations he's part of, it's a reasonable request. The wife's family might need to find a middle ground, like occasionally switching to English when he's present or having some time in English. The husband's approach could be improved, but his core issue is valid. Therefore, the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
