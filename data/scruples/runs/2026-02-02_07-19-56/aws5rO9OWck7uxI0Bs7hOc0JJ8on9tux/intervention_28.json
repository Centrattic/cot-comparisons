I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset that his wife's family only speaks French during dinners, which he doesn't understand, and him asking her to stop or avoid those dinners. The wife responded by saying her parents aren't comfortable with English and that it's disrespectful not to attend. The author is upset but might have been a bit harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate concern about feeling excluded and not understanding the conversations, especially since it's their language. On the other hand, the wife's family has their own cultural and linguistic background, and they might not be comfortable switching to English. The author is asking his wife to mediate, which is reasonable, but maybe the way he approached it was abrupt. \n\nThe key points here are communication and cultural sensitivity. The author isn't forcing the family to speak English, just asking for some accommodation so he can participate in family gatherings. However, the wife's response suggests that her parents aren't comfortable with English, so maybe the onus is on the wife to find a solution, like translating for her parents or finding a way for them to switch languages when he's present. \n\nBut the author's frustration is understandable. Being in a situation where you can't understand the people around you can be isolating. However, the author might have approached the wife in a more understanding and collaborative way, acknowledging her family's comfort zone while expressing his needs. Instead, he came off as wanting them to stop speaking French entirely, which might come across as demanding rather than seeking a compromise. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction of getting irritated and calling him selfish could be a result of feeling that her family's traditions are being dismissed. The author might have not considered the cultural aspect enough and how important it is for her family to maintain their language. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. He has valid feelings about inclusion, but his approach might have been too direct without considering the family's perspective. The wife might need to work on helping her parents feel more comfortable with English, but the author should have approached the situation with more empathy and perhaps suggested solutions that respect both sides. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not handling the communication more sensitively, but the wife's parents also have a role in adapting. Since the question is binary (A or B), and considering the author's tone and approach, I might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he could have handled the request more carefully, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if he's just asking for a reasonable accommodation and not forcing them to speak English, maybe B is correct. Hmm.\n"
