I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop speaking French with her family during dinners when he's present. The author can't understand French and felt left out during a dinner with her parents. He asked if he could skip those dinners if he can't understand the conversation, but his wife got irritated and said he was being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife and her parents are speaking their native language, which is common in many bilingual or multilingual families. The husband is part of the couple, but he's not part of the extended family, so maybe he's not expected to know French. However, the wife is an adult and part of the couple, so maybe there's an expectation for her to facilitate communication between her parents and her husband.\n\nThe husband's request seems reasonable because he's trying to be included. If the entire dinner is in French, he's excluded from the conversation, which might make him feel isolated. On the other hand, the wife's parents might not be comfortable speaking English, which is a valid point. But the wife, being bilingual, could act as a mediator. She might have a responsibility to translate key parts of the conversation so her husband isn't completely left out.\n\nThe husband's reaction might have been a bit abrupt when he said he wanted to stop attending, but his frustration is understandable. However, the wife's response that he's being selfish might be a bit harsh. The wife could have tried to bridge the language gap instead of just dismissing her husband's feelings. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, it's common for families to speak their heritage language at home, especially when they're more comfortable in it. But when a partner is present, there's usually an expectation that both partners make an effort to include each other. The wife's parents not speaking English isn't the problem, but the wife's failure to ensure her husband isn't left out might be an issue.\n\nSo, the husband isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting to understand the conversation. However, his approach might have been confrontational. The wife could have handled it better by translating or finding a middle ground. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to adjust. The key point is whether the wife facilitated communication, which she might not have done, so the husband's request is understandable.\n"
