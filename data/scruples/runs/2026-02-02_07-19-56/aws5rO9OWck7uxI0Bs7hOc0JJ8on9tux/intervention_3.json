I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife's parents speaking French during dinner, which he doesn't understand. The author asked her to stop or at least switch to English, but she got irritated and said he was being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel left out because he can't understand the conversations. It's possible he's feeling isolated or frustrated, especially if they're laughing or discussing things he can't partake in. On the other hand, the wife's parents might be more comfortable in French, and the wife may not want to force her parents to switch languages, as that could be seen as disrespectful to their culture or comfort zone.\n\nThe author says he's not trying to make her speak a particular language, but he's upset that the family conversations are in a language he doesn't know. The wife's response is that her parents aren't comfortable with English. So the issue is about the author's discomfort versus the cultural or personal comfort of the wife's parents.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing a valid concern about feeling excluded. However, he's asking his wife to change the family's dynamics, which might not be her decision to make. Maybe he could have tried learning some French or asked the wife to translate key parts instead of expecting the whole family to switch. Alternatively, if he doesn't want to attend, is it reasonable to say that? The wife argues it's disrespectful not to show up, which is a common cultural norm in many families.\n\nThe author's approach might come off as demanding. Instead of asking her to make the family switch, he could have discussed it more calmly and found a middle ground, like having a time to speak in English or learning the language. But he did ask her to stop, which might be seen as putting pressure on her family's traditions. So maybe he's a bit in the wrong because he's not considering the family's comfort and cultural aspects. However, his feelings are valid too. The answer might depend on how much the wife and parents are willing to accommodate him without forcing their own to change. Since he's not asking his wife to change but the parents, maybe it's a bit of a gray area. But traditionally, in such situations, family traditions can be sensitive. The wife's irritation might be because she feels he's not respecting her family's way. So I think the author might be partially in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. But the question is to choose A or B. I'd say A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering the family's comfort and is making a demand that's hard for the wife to fulfill without being disrespectful to her parents.\n"
