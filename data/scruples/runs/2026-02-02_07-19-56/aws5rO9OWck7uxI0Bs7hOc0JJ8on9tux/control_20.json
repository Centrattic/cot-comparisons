I sat there mostly wondering what was going on and was just confused when they erupted in laughter. After dinner I asked if it's possible for me to not come to these dinners if I can't understand the conversation or at least speak English at the table. She got irritated by this and told me that her parents weren't comfortable with English but I should still come because it would disrespectful not to show up to meet her parents if they are in the city. I was kinda ticked off because I don't think I have to be in this situation. Although, I could have probably taken a more calm tone, She said I'm just being selfish and went to work.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a person who's upset because their wife's family only speaks French during dinners, which he doesn't understand, and he asked them to switch to English or for him to be excused. The wife got irritated and said it's about being respectful to her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author isn't forcing his wife to speak any language; he's bilingual, and so is she. The issue is when he's included in family dinners where he can't understand the conversations. He's not saying they should stop being French or stop their language; he just wants to be part of the conversation or not have to be there. He asked to be excused but got a negative reaction from his wife, who said it's about respect.\n\nNow, considering cultural sensitivity. The wife's parents might feel more comfortable speaking their native language, which is common in many cultures. However, when a third party (the husband) is present, especially in a social setting like a family dinner, there's an expectation that everyone can participate. If the husband is expected to attend, the family might be expected to make some accommodation, like switching to a common language, to include him. But maybe there's a cultural aspect where the parents are not used to speaking English, and it's a valid part of their comfort zone.\n\nThe husband's frustration is understandable; being excluded from conversations can be isolating. His request seems reasonable: either speak English so he can participate or allow him not to attend. However, the wife's stance is that it's about respect to her parents, implying that not attending would be disrespectful. There's a conflict between the husband's need to be included and the wife's need to honor her parents' preferences.\n\nIs the husband being selfish? Maybe not entirely. He's expressing discomfort at being excluded. But maybe he could have approached it differently. The wife might feel caught between her husband's needs and her family's traditions. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for making that request. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone is invited to a gathering, especially a family dinner, it's customary to make an effort to include the guest. However, if the family is not comfortable using another language, they might not be at fault either. The husband's right to feel included vs. the family's right to use their preferred language. \n\nThe key here is that the husband isn't asking for the family to stop speaking French in general, just during dinners when he's present. That seems like a reasonable request. However, if the family is not willing or able to switch, then expecting the husband to attend might be reasonable from the wife's perspective, as it's a cultural thing. \n\nSo, is the husband wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not forcing anyone to change their language, just asking for accommodation. But the wife's parents might not be able to do that. The husband's approach might come off as demanding, which could be where the wife felt he was being selfish. However, his request is valid. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to find a compromise.\n"
