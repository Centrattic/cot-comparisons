      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author \"evil and controlling,\" even though the author didn't say they couldn't do their own videos, just that the kids shouldn't be included.\n\nFirst, the author's main concerns are about potential bullying and overexposure for the kids. That's a valid concern, especially with the internet's reach and the permanence of content. Parents often have differing views on how much exposure is safe for children. The author is trying to protect the kids, which is a common parental instinct.\n\nThen there's the fianc\u00e9's perspective. She wants to create content, which is her right. However, involving the kids in that content might require consent, which they can't give. The author is setting a boundary here, which is about parental responsibility. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be about feeling controlled, but the author isn't restricting her from creating content\u2014just limiting the inclusion of the children.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is being controlling. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from making videos; they're just not allowing the kids to be part of them. That's a reasonable boundary. The fianc\u00e9 might feel it's a restriction, but the author's stance is about protecting the children's well-being, which is a legitimate parental concern.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the situation hinges on parental rights versus creative freedom. The author is asserting their role in safeguarding the kids, which many would support. The fianc\u00e9's frustration is understandable if she feels her career aspirations are being limited, but the author's primary duty is to the children's safety and privacy.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. Their concern is valid, and they're making decisions in the children's best interest. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling her autonomy is being challenged, but the author's boundary is about protecting the kids, not controlling the fianc\u00e9.\n"
