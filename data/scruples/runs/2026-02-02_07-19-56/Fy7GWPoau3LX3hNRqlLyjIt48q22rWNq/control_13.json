      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 wanting to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids, and the author is against it because of potential downsides like bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from making her own videos; the issue is specifically about including their children. The author's concern is about the kids' well-being\u2014bullying and exposure to public scrutiny. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her own interests and might see the kids as part of that content. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents typically share in the decision-making regarding their children's lives. Even though the fianc\u00e9 is creating the content, involving the kids would require the consent of both parents, especially since they're not yet married. The author's stance is about protecting the kids, which is a valid parental concern. The fianc\u00e9's argument that the author is being controlling might be based on the fact that he's not allowing her to include the kids in her personal projects, but the author's main point is about the children's safety and well-being, not controlling her actions entirely. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like he's standing up for his concerns about the kids' exposure, which is a reasonable position. The fianc\u00e9's frustration might stem from feeling her creative freedom is restricted, but the author's primary concern is the children's best interests. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
