      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is expressing concern about the potential downsides of having their children in the videos, like bullying and overexposure. They've asked the fianc\u00e9 not to include the kids, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author controlling and evil. The key here is that the author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos; they're just objecting to the inclusion of their children.\n\nLegal aspects might come into play here. Parents generally have the right to make decisions about their children's exposure, especially regarding privacy and safety. Even if the fianc\u00e9 is the parent, both parents typically share responsibility for the children's well-being. So, the author's stance could be seen as protecting the kids' privacy, which is a valid concern.\n\nEmotionally, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her creative or career aspirations are being restricted. However, the author isn't stopping her from pursuing YouTube; it's about the content involving the children. There's a balance between personal freedom and parental responsibility. The author's perspective is about safeguarding the children's future, which is a common concern in today's digital age where online presence can have long-term effects.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The fianc\u00e9 might argue that she has the right to include the kids in her content, especially if they are her own. However, shared custody or joint parenting responsibilities mean both parents have a say. If the author is the other parent, their objection is valid. If not, the situation might be different, but the question states the author is the fianc\u00e9, implying they are both parents.\n\nAlso, the author isn't imposing an outright ban on her content, just the inclusion of the children. That seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil and controlling might be an overreaction if the author is merely voicing a concern rather than being authoritarian.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people support parents in keeping their children's online presence minimal to protect them from potential harm. So the author's stance aligns with common protective measures.\n\nI should also consider if there's any existing agreement or previous discussions about the kids' exposure in media. But the scenario doesn't mention any, so it's a new conflict. Without prior agreements, the author's current stance isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is acting in the children's best interest by wanting to avoid potential risks, which is a responsible position. The fianc\u00e9's frustration is understandable if her creative goals are being limited, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the kids' safety and privacy.\n"
