      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create YouTube videos with their kids, due to concerns about bullying and overexposure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is concerned about their children's privacy and safety, which are valid parental concerns. They didn't say the fianc\u00e9 can't do her own videos, just that the kids shouldn't be in them. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being controlling. There's a conflict between the author's protective stance and the fianc\u00e9's desire to create content.\n\nI should think about parental responsibilities. Parents have a duty to protect their children from potential harms like cyberbullying or exposure. However, there's also the aspect of the fianc\u00e9's creative freedom. But since the kids are minors, the parents' consent is necessary for any public content involving them. The author's request seems reasonable to prevent negative outcomes.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling them evil and controlling might indicate a misunderstanding or lack of communication. The author isn't stopping her from vlogging but is setting boundaries regarding their children. So the author is likely not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
