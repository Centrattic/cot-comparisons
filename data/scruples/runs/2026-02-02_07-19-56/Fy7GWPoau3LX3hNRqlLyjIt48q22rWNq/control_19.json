      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong regarding their fianc\u00e9 wanting to start a YouTube channel with their kids. The author is against including the kids, citing potential bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos, just not including the kids. So it's about the children's privacy and safety. Parents generally have a duty to protect their children from harm, which includes online exposure risks like bullying or predators. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about her freedom to do what she wants, but when it involves children, parental responsibility comes into play.\n\nThe author is trying to find a balance between the fianc\u00e9's creative goals and the kids' well-being. There's no outright ban on her content, just a request not to involve the children. That seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be because she feels restricted, but the author's concerns are valid. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They\u2019re prioritizing the kids' safety. The answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
