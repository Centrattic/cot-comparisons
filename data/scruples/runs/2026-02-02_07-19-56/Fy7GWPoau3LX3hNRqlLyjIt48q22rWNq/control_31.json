      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author's main concerns are about potential bullying and overexposure for the children. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author controlling and evil. The author didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just not with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents have a duty to protect their children's privacy and well-being. Exposing kids to public platforms like YouTube can indeed lead to issues like cyberbullying, predators, and long-term digital footprints that the kids didn't consent to. So from a protective standpoint, the author has valid concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to create content, maybe for creative or financial reasons. However, including the kids without their consent (since they can't consent) complicates things. The author isn't stopping her from making her own content, just not involving the children. That seems reasonable because the children's participation isn't optional if they're being featured without their say-so.\n\nThe key here is the age of the kids. If they're very young, they can't understand the implications. Even if they're older, the decision should ideally be made with their input. But the author is making the decision to protect them, which is part of parenting. The fianc\u00e9's argument that the author is controlling might stem from a conflict between her creative freedom and the children's rights to privacy.\n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's exposure in media. Unless there's a legal agreement otherwise, the parent's decision to protect the kids from potential harm is justified. The author isn't being controlling by setting boundaries that prioritize the children's safety. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
