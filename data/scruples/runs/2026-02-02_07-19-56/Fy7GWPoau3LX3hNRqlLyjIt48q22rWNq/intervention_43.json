      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is the fianc\u00e9 of someone who wants to start a YouTube channel or vlog that includes their kids. The author is against it, citing potential downsides like bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being controlling and evil. The author didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just not include the kids.\n\nHmm, first, I should consider the main points. The author is concerned about the kids' well-being, which is a valid point. Children on social media can face privacy issues, bullying, and long-term consequences. But the fianc\u00e9 feels restricted in her creative expression. There's a conflict between personal freedom and protecting children.\n\nI need to think about the balance here. The author isn't trying to stop her from creating content entirely, just the inclusion of the kids. That seems reasonable. However, the fianc\u00e9 might see it as a restriction on her autonomy. But from a protective standpoint, parents often have to make decisions to safeguard their children's future. \n\nAlso, the author is the fianc\u00e9, so they might not have legal guardianship yet. But assuming they are co-parenting, both have a say in their children's welfare. The author's concerns are about safety, which is a common issue in today's digital age. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her career or passion is being hindered. But does she have the right to involve the children without the other parent's consent? In many cases, both parents have equal rights and responsibilities, so the author's objection could be seen as valid. \n\nI think the key is whether including the kids in videos has a legitimate upside worth the risks. The author argues there's no upside, but maybe the fianc\u00e9 sees benefits like financial gain or visibility. However, the potential harm is significant. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's stance seems justified. They're trying to protect the children from potential harm, which is a parent's responsibility. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author controlling might be an overreaction. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
