      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 wanting to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids, but the author is against it due to concerns about bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from creating content herself; the issue is specifically about including the kids. The author's reasons are about protecting the children's privacy and safety, which are valid concerns. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 argues her right to do what she wants, which is understandable too.\n\nChild privacy is a big deal. Parents often have different opinions on sharing their kids' lives online. The author is not being controlling in a general sense but is focused on the children's well-being. However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative freedom is being restricted. There's a balance between parental responsibility and respecting a partner's ambitions.\n\nThe response should consider whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since the author isn't prohibiting the fianc\u00e9 from making content, just not involving the children, it seems like a valid boundary. The potential risks of online exposure, especially for children, are real. So, the author's concerns are justified. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil might be an overreaction, indicating possible miscommunication or differing values.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents often have to make decisions in their children's best interest, even if it goes against a partner's wishes. The author isn't being controlling in a harmful way but is setting a boundary for the kids' safety. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
