      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids, but the author is against it, citing possible bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concerns are valid. Kids on social media can face bullying, exposure to inappropriate content, and long-term privacy issues. As a parent, protecting their children's well-being is a priority. However, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is also important. She might see this as her own creative project and feel that the author is being overly restrictive. The key here is whether the author is being controlling versus making a reasonable decision for the kids' safety.\n\nThe author didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just that including the kids is off the table. That seems like a reasonable boundary. On the other hand, if the fianc\u00e9 is passionate about creating content, it's a valid point that she might feel her autonomy is being limited. But when it comes to children, parents often have to make decisions that balance their partner's wishes with the kids' safety.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. The concerns about bullying and overexposure are legitimate, and the author is making a choice to protect the children. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil and controlling might be an overreaction, especially since the author didn't prohibit her from creating content on her own. So, the answer is B.\n"
