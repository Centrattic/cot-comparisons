      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Ask the Internet (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is against including the kids in the videos because they think it could lead to bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 says the author is being controlling and evil. The author clarifies they aren't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos, just not with the kids.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, parental concerns about children's exposure on social media are common. There's a valid point about protecting kids from potential online risks like bullying or privacy issues. The author is setting a boundary about the kids' inclusion, which might be seen as responsible parenting. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative or career aspirations are being restricted. But the author isn't stopping her from making content on her own.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations come into play here. Parents typically have the responsibility to protect their children, so the author's stance might be justified. However, communication is key. If the author and fianc\u00e9 can't find a compromise, that could strain their relationship. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the relationship dynamics.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to protect the kids. The fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting by calling the author controlling, especially since the author allows her to make her own videos. The key is that the author isn't restricting the fianc\u00e9's content entirely, just the inclusion of the children. So the answer is B.\n"
