      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting their kids to be on a YouTube channel or vlog. The fianc\u00e9 argues that there's no upside and risks like bullying and overexposure. The other person says the author is evil and controlling. The author clarifies they didn't stop the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos but just not including the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' responsibilities. Children can't consent to being on camera, so the parents have a duty to protect them. The author is concerned about privacy and potential harms, which are valid. The fianc\u00e9 wants to create content with the kids, which could expose them to online dangers. The author is trying to prevent that, which seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative freedom is being restricted. But when it comes to children, their well-being is a priority. The author isn't stopping her from creating content; they just want the kids out of it. That seems fair. The fianc\u00e9's reaction (\"evil and controlling\") might be an overreaction, especially since the author didn't prohibit her from making her own videos. So the author's stance is about protecting the kids, not controlling their partner. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
