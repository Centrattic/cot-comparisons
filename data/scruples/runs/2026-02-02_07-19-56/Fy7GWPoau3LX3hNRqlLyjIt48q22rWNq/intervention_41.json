      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author is concerned about potential bullying and overexposure for the kids. The partner is upset, calling the author controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos, just not including the kids. The main issue is about the children's privacy and safety. Parents generally have a duty to protect their children from negative exposure, especially online where content can be permanent and widely accessible. \n\nBullying is a real concern. Kids in the public eye can face harassment, which might affect their mental health. The author's stance seems protective. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that the author is being controlling. The question is whether the author has the right to say no regarding the kids' inclusion in the content.\n\nAnother angle: the fianc\u00e9's right to pursue her passion versus the author's concerns for their children's well-being. But when it comes to children, parental consent and protection are typically non-negotiable. The author isn't stopping her from creating content; the issue is the inclusion of minors. \n\nSo, the author is likely not in the wrong. They're prioritizing the children's safety and privacy. The fianc\u00e9's argument that the author is controlling might stem from feeling her creative freedom is limited, but the author's position is about protecting the kids, which is a valid parental concern.\n"
