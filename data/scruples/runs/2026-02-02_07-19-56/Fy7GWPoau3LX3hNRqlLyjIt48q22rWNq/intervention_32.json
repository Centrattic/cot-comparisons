      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to create a YouTube channel or vlog featuring their kids, but the author is against it due to concerns about bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 accuses the author of being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main argument is about protecting the kids from potential negative outcomes like bullying and exposure. That's a valid concern, especially since children might not understand the implications of being online. Parents have a responsibility to safeguard their kids' privacy and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her own interests and possibly earn income through her videos. She might see the inclusion of the kids as necessary for the content. She feels that the author is being controlling because he's not allowing her to do what she wants, even if it's just about including the kids sometimes.\n\nBut the key point here is consent. The kids are minors, so their parents need to have their best interests at heart. Even if the author didn't explicitly forbid her from making her own videos, involving the children in such a public platform without their consent later in life could be an issue. The author is likely thinking about the long-term effects, which is understandable.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative freedom is being stifled. But when it comes to children, parental decisions usually take precedence. The author isn't stopping her from doing her own videos; he's just opposing the inclusion of the kids. That seems reasonable because the children's welfare is the priority.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's accusation of being \"evil and controlling\" seems harsh. The author isn't preventing her from doing her own content, just making a boundary regarding the kids. It's about balancing her aspirations with the children's safety. So, the author's stance isn't about controlling her but protecting the kids. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
