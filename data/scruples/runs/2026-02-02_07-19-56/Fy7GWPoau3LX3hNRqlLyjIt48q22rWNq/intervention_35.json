      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to create a YouTube channel or vlog including their kids, but the author is against it because of potential bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights versus the children's well-being. The author is concerned about the kids' privacy and safety, which are valid points. Children are vulnerable online, and exposure can have long-term effects. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos, just not involving the kids. That seems reasonable because the kids can't consent, and their future could be impacted.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative expression is being limited. But the key here is that the author is not saying she can't do anything, just not include the kids. There's a balance between personal freedom and protecting children. Laws often prioritize the child's best interest in such matters. So, the author's stance is about protecting the kids, which is a responsible parental duty.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil and controlling is a strong reaction, which might indicate a conflict in values or priorities. But the author isn't being controlling; they're setting a boundary for the children's sake. The author's position is about safeguarding the kids' future, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
