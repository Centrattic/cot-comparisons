      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is controlling and evil, but the author didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just not include the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about the potential negative impacts on the kids, like bullying and overexposure. That's a valid concern. Parents often have to make decisions to protect their children's privacy and well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her own creative outlet and share content, which is understandable too.\n\nBut the key here is that the author is only objecting to the inclusion of the children. It's their kids, so both parents should have a say in decisions that affect them. The author isn't stopping her from making her own content; they're just disagreeing on involving the children. The fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative freedom is being restricted, but the author is prioritizing the kids' safety and privacy.\n\nI should also think about legal and ethical aspects. Parents have a duty to protect their children from potential harms, including online exposure. The author's stance could be seen as responsible parenting. However, if the fianc\u00e9 feels her autonomy is being dismissed, that's another layer. But the author isn't stopping her from creating content on her own.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is making a decision based on the children's best interests. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be a bit extreme if the author isn't trying to control her entirely but just has concerns about the kids. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
