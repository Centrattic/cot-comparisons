      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's read the situation again.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who doesn't want their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. Their reasoning is that there's no upside for the kids and it could lead to bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9's partner is upset, calling them evil and controlling. The author clarifies they didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just that she shouldn't include the kids.\n\nThe person asking thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's correct. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's concern is about the kids' privacy and potential online safety issues. That makes sense because children on social media can face risks like bullying, exposure to inappropriate content, or predators. Parents often have the right to make decisions about their children's exposure, especially if they believe it's in the kids' best interest.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her YouTube channel, which is her own creative project. She might see including the kids as a way to share their lives or build a family presence online. However, the author is making a reasonable request to exclude the kids, not to stop her from vlogging entirely. It's about balancing personal goals with the children's welfare.\n\nThe partner's reaction, calling the author evil and controlling, seems harsh. The author isn't trying to control her content, just protect the children. Unless there's a legal or custody issue, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their children's online presence.\n\nBut wait, is the author overstepping? Maybe if the partner is a co-parent, both should agree on what's best for the kids. The author's stance is about safety, which is a valid parental concern. The fianc\u00e9's frustration might stem from feeling her creative freedom is limited, but the author's request is specific to the children's inclusion, not her own activities.\n\nIn terms of rights, parents generally have the authority to make decisions for their children. So the author isn't wrong for wanting to protect the kids. The conflict arises from differing priorities: one wants to protect, the other wants creative freedom. However, the author's position is about the children's safety, which takes precedence.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Their concern is valid, and they're not preventing the partner from pursuing her content, just advocating for the kids' privacy. The partner's reaction might be unreasonable given the author's valid concerns.\n"
