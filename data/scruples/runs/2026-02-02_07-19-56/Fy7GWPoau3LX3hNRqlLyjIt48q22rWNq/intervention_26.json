      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, presumably the fianc\u00e9, doesn't want their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog that includes their kids. The partner is upset, calling the author evil and controlling. The author clarifies they didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just not with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main concern is the kids being exposed to potential bullying and overexposure. That's a valid concern because children on social media can face harassment, which might affect their mental health and future. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children from such risks.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her passion for creating content. Maybe she's looking to build a channel, gain followers, or express herself creatively. However, including children complicates that. There's a balance between personal freedom and protecting minors.\n\nThe author isn't outright preventing her from vlogging; they just want the kids excluded. That seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil and controlling might be an overreaction. The author isn't stopping her from doing her own content, just setting boundaries regarding the kids. \n\nBut maybe the fianc\u00e9 feels her autonomy is being restricted. However, when it comes to children, both parents should have a say in their upbringing. The author's stance is about the children's well-being, not controlling her partner. \n\nSo, considering the potential harm to the kids versus the partner's creative desires, the author's position seems justified. The key point is that the kids aren't old enough to consent, so both parents need to agree on their exposure. The author isn't in the wrong here; they're prioritizing the children's safety.\n"
