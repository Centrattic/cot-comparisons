      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to start a YouTube channel with their kids, but the author is against it because they think it's risky\u2014bullying, overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 is calling the author evil and controlling. The author says they're not stopping her from doing her own videos, just not including the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is concerned about the children's safety and exposure, which is valid. Parents often have different opinions on how much to expose their kids to public platforms. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, wants creative freedom. The argument is that the author is restricting her, but he's not stopping her from vlogging; just not involving the kids.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships, communication is key. If the author clearly stated their concerns and the fianc\u00e9 feels it's being used as a controlling measure, there might be a misunderstanding. But the author isn't saying no to her doing it herself, just not with the kids. That seems reasonable from a protective parent's perspective. However, if the fianc\u00e9 perceives that as controlling, maybe there's an issue in how the author communicated their concerns. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author has valid concerns about their children's privacy and safety. The fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative freedom is being curtailed. But the author isn't blocking her entirely, just limiting the scope. So, the author's stance seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling them evil and controlling might be over the top if the author isn't restricting her entirely. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
