      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to create a YouTube channel or vlog including their kids, but the author is against it. The author is concerned about the kids being exposed to bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying they're evil and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making a request, not a demand. They're saying they don't want the kids included, not that the fianc\u00e9 can't do the vlogs at all. The fianc\u00e9, however, is interpreting this as a control issue. The author didn't stop her from doing her own videos, just the ones with the kids. That seems reasonable because children can't consent to being on a public platform. There's a valid concern about their privacy and safety. \n\nBut then again, the fianc\u00e9 has her own aspirations and might feel that her creative freedom is being restricted. However, when it comes to children, parents usually have a responsibility to protect them, even if it's a personal project. So the author's stance is about protecting the kids, not controlling the fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting by calling the author evil, which is a strong term. \n\nOn the other hand, could there be a compromise? Maybe the fianc\u00e9 could make the vlogs without the kids, or wait until the kids are older and can decide for themselves. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing the children's well-being. The fianc\u00e9's frustration might stem from feeling her goals are being dismissed, but the author's concerns are legitimate. \n\nI think the key point here is that the author isn't forbidding the fianc\u00e9 entirely but is specifically concerned about the children's involvement. The author's position is about protecting the kids from potential harms, which is a valid parental concern. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to misunderstand or downplay the author's legitimate worries. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
