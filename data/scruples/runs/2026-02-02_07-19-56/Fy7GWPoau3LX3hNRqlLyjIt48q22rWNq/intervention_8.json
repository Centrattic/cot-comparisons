      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want their kids to be in the fianc\u00e9e's YouTube channel or vlogs. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling them evil and controlling, even though the author didn't stop her from doing her own videos, just not with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is about privacy and potential harm to children. The author is concerned about bullying and overexposure, which are valid fears. Parents often have to make decisions to protect their children's well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e wants to pursue her own interests and maybe share her life, which is understandable. But when it involves children, it's a different matter. \n\nIn many places, there are laws regarding the privacy of minors, especially online. Parents have a duty to protect their children from exploitation or exposure without their consent. The author is asserting their right as a parent to limit the children's presence in public media. The fianc\u00e9e, however, might feel that her creative or personal expression is being restricted. But if the author isn't blocking her from creating content without the kids, just with them, then maybe the conflict is about boundaries and mutual respect in a partnership.\n\nI should think about the balance between parental responsibility and personal freedom. While the fianc\u00e9e has her own goals, the children's welfare takes precedence. The author is not preventing her from vlogging entirely but is setting a boundary about involving the kids. That seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be an overreaction if the author isn't infringing on her ability to create content without the children. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the fianc\u00e9e feels that including the kids is a natural part of her content, or she believes the benefits outweigh the risks. However, the author's concerns are valid and based on protecting the kids. It's a common issue in modern parenting where social media presence can affect children's lives. \n\nI think the key is whether the author is being controlling or just setting reasonable boundaries for the children's sake. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9e from doing her own videos, just not including the kids. That seems fair. The fianc\u00e9e's accusation of being evil and controlling is harsh if the author is only concerned about the kids' exposure. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here.\n"
