      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who doesn't want their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog that includes their kids. The main concerns are potential bullying and overexposure. The partner argues that the author is being evil and controlling. The author clarifies they aren't against the partner doing her own videos but just don't want the kids included.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasons are about protecting the children from possible negative outcomes like bullying and being overexposed online. On the other hand, the partner wants creative freedom and maybe sees the vlogs as a way to share their lives, which could have benefits like personal fulfillment or even income.\n\nI should think about parental rights and responsibilities. Parents typically have the right to make decisions about their children's well-being. If the author is genuinely concerned about the kids' safety and future, that's a valid point. But it's also important to consider the partner's autonomy. However, when it comes to children, both parents usually have a say, especially if they're both involved in parenting decisions. The author might be within their rights to object to including the children in the vlogs if they believe it's in the kids' best interest.\n\nBut wait, the partner might feel that her creative expression is being restricted. That's a conflict between personal freedom and parental responsibility. The key here is whether the author's concerns are legitimate and if they're communicating effectively. The author isn't stopping the partner from vlogging; it's specifically about including the kids. That seems reasonable as long as it's about the kids' welfare.\n\nThe partner calling the author evil and controlling suggests that there might be an emotional component or past issues where the author might have overstepped in other areas. But based solely on the information given, the author's stance is about protecting the children, which is a common parental concern. However, it's possible that the partner feels her autonomy is being violated, even if the author's intentions are good.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the author is acting in good faith to protect the children and hasn't imposed other restrictions, then maybe not. But if the partner's vlogging is a significant part of her identity and the author is being overly controlling in other aspects, that could tip the scales. Since the user mentioned the author isn't stopping the partner from doing her own videos, the focus is solely on the inclusion of the kids. In that case, the author's position seems justified as a protective measure, especially given the potential risks involved in having children online. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
