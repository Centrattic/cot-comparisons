      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author is worried about potential bullying and overexposure for the kids. The fianc\u00e9 accuses them of being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights and responsibilities. As a parent, protecting children from potential harm is a key duty. Social media exposure can indeed lead to privacy issues, cyberbullying, and other risks. The author isn't stopping their partner from creating content themselves, just asking that the kids not be included. That seems reasonable because the children can't consent to being part of such content. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is about personal freedom, but when it involves children, the parents have a responsibility to prioritize the kids' well-being. It's a shared decision, so the author's stance isn't about controlling their partner but about protecting the children. Unless there's a mutual agreement on involving the children, the author has a valid point. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the parent is acting in the children's best interest.\n"
