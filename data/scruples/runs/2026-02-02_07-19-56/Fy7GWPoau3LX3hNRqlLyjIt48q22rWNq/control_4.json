      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel with their kids. The author is concerned about potential bullying and overexposure for the kids. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's controlling and that the author is being evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' responsibilities. Parents have a duty to protect their children from harm. Public exposure on social media can indeed lead to bullying, privacy issues, and other risks. The author's concern isn't unfounded; there are real dangers in putting kids online. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her passion. But the key issue here is the inclusion of the children. The author isn't stopping her from creating content herself, just from involving the kids. That seems reasonable. It's about balancing personal goals with the children's well-being.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author \"evil and controlling\" seems harsh. The author's stance is about protecting the kids, not controlling the fianc\u00e9. It's a valid parental concern, and the author isn't restricting her entirely from creating content. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a decision based on the children's best interests, which is a parent's prerogative. The fianc\u00e9's frustration is there, but the author's position is justified.\n"
