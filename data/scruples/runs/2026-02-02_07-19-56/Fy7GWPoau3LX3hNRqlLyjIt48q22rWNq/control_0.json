      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog their kids. The author is concerned about potential bullying and overexposure for the kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author controlling.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is about protecting their children's privacy and well-being. That seems valid because kids' online presence can have long-term consequences. Exposure on social media might lead to bullying, which is a real risk. Parents have a responsibility to consider their children's safety, even if the kids are older.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants creative freedom. But the author isn't stopping her from creating content; they just want to exclude the kids. The author's stance is about the kids' inclusion, not her ability to vlog. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling her autonomy is restricted, but the author's concern is about the children's welfare. \n\nIn such situations, parental consent and the best interests of the children usually take precedence. The author isn't being controlling in a general sense but is making a specific choice about their children's exposure. Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to allow such content, the author's position seems justified. So the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
