      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's a fianc\u00e9, doesn't want their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The partner is upset and calls the author controlling. The author isn't stopping the partner from making their own videos but wants to exclude the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's concern is about the kids being exposed to potential bullying and overexposure. Those are valid concerns, especially since children can't consent to being on social media. On the other hand, the partner wants to do a YouTube channel, which is her right, but involving kids complicates things.\n\nIn many places, there are laws about children and online content. For example, COPPA in the US requires parental consent for children under 13. But since they're the parents, maybe they have consent. However, the author is worried about the long-term effects. Even if legal, it's an ethical decision about the kids' privacy and well-being.\n\nThe partner feels it's about control. The author is not stopping her from making her own videos, just not with the kids. The key here is that the author is making a boundary for the children's protection, which could be seen as responsible, not controlling. If the author had forbidden her from creating any content, that would be different, but the focus is on the kids' inclusion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like they're making a reasonable decision to protect their children's privacy and safety, which is a common concern. The partner's reaction of calling them evil might be an overreaction, especially since the author isn't restricting her own creative freedom but is limiting the involvement of the kids. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
