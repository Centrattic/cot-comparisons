      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying the author is controlling and evil, but the author hasn't stopped her from making her own videos, just not including the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concern is about potential bullying and overexposure for the kids. That's a valid concern because kids in the public eye can face online harassment. Parents often have a duty to protect their children's privacy and well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants creative freedom and to pursue her YouTube ambitions. She might feel that her partner is overstepping by restricting her content when she's not banning her entirely.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author is specifically objecting to the inclusion of their children. They're not preventing her from making her own videos; they're just asking her to exclude the kids. The line between supporting a partner's creative endeavors and protecting children's privacy can be tricky. The author is making a request based on the kids' welfare, which is a parent's responsibility. The fianc\u00e9, however, might feel her autonomy is being limited. \n\nI should check if the author's stance is reasonable. Are there real risks involved? Yes, exposure and bullying are real issues for kids on social media. The author isn't being authoritarian by banning all content; they're just asking for the kids' exclusion. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil and controlling might be an overreaction if the request is about the children's well-being. \n\nSo, considering the protection of children versus the partner's creative freedom, the author's position is about safeguarding the kids. Unless there's a mutual agreement or compromise, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
