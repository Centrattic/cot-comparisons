      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong when they don't want their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author is concerned about potential bullying and overexposure, while the fianc\u00e9 feels controlled and called evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are about protecting the kids from possible negative outcomes. They didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just not with the kids. That seems like a reasonable boundary. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that her creative freedom is being restricted. She might see vlogging as a personal passion, and including the kids could be part of that. \n\nBut the author's concern is valid too. Children in videos can face privacy issues, cyberbullying, or other problems. The parent has a responsibility to protect their children's well-being. The key here is whether the author is being controlling versus protective. The author didn't outright ban her from doing anything; the request is specific to not involving the kids. So the author's stance is about the kids' safety, not about controlling the fianc\u00e9's actions. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil and controlling might indicate that she feels her autonomy is being violated. But the author's request is about the children, not her activities. There's a difference between controlling behavior and advocating for the kids' privacy. \n\nIn such cases, communication is crucial. If there's a mutual understanding of the risks and benefits, they might find a compromise. But the author isn't in the wrong just because they have concerns. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
