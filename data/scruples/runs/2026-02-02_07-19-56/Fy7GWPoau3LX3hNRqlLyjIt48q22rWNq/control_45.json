The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The key points here are consent, privacy, and potential risks like bullying or overexposure.\n\nFirst, the author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from making videos herself, just not involving the kids. That's important because children can't consent to being on social media. Their parents have a responsibility to protect them. Even if the other person is okay with it, the kids themselves might not be, and they can't express that until they're older. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being controlling or evil. But if the concern is the kids' well-being and safety by not exposing them to online risks, that seems valid. It's about protecting them from potential cyberbullying or privacy issues. \n\nThe author's stance isn't about controlling the fianc\u00e9's actions but about the children's involvement. So, the author is probably justified in their stance. The answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
