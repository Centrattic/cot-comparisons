      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting their partner to start a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author is concerned about potential bullying and overexposure for the kids. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is controlling and evil for not allowing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main argument is about protecting the kids from possible negative outcomes like bullying and exposure. As a parent, protecting children is a natural instinct. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants creative freedom and to pursue her passion, which is understandable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not preventing the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos but specifically wants the kids excluded, that seems reasonable. Parents do have a say in decisions affecting their children's well-being. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's about her freedom might be valid, but the kids' safety is a priority. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could be open to discussing it, setting boundaries, or ensuring the kids are comfortable. If the author is being overly controlling without considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective, that could be a problem. However, the initial scenario doesn't mention the author being rigid; they just want the kids excluded. So, protecting the kids might take precedence here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and context. The author's intention is protective, while the fianc\u00e9's is about personal goals. Since the kids are involved, the author's stance might be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
