      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting to create a YouTube channel with their kids, but the author is against it because of concerns about bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're worried about their kids' safety and well-being. Kids being exposed to the public eye can have risks, like cyberbullying, privacy issues, or being targeted. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from making her own videos, just not involving the kids. That seems like a reasonable boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her passion, which is understandable. But the author's main concern is the kids' best interests. Since the kids are minors, the parents have a responsibility to protect them. The author isn't dictating her career but setting limits on involving the children.\n\nIs the author being controlling? Maybe the fianc\u00e9 feels her autonomy is being restricted, but when it comes to children, parental decisions often involve balancing both parents' wishes and the kids' safety. The author isn't banning all her content, just excluding the kids. That seems fair. Plus, the author didn't say she can't do her own videos. So, the author is standing up for the kids' protection, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their children's safety, which is a responsible stance. The fianc\u00e9 might need to find another way to pursue her vlogging without involving the kids.\n"
