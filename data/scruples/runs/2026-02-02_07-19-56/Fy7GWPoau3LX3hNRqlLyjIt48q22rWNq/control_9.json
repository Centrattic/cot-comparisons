      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The user is asking for an opinion on this scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is concerned about the potential downsides like bullying and overexposure for the kids. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels controlled and called evil. The author isn't stopping her from doing her own videos, just not involving the kids.\n\nFrom a parental responsibility standpoint, protecting children's privacy and well-being is important. Exposing kids on social media can lead to issues like cyberbullying, invasion of privacy, and long-term consequences. The author's stance seems to be about protecting the children, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is about her freedom to create content. There might be a conflict between her interests and the children's welfare. The key here is whether the author's objection is reasonable. Since the author isn't stopping her from making her own content without the kids, it's about the inclusion of the children.\n\nLegal aspects might also play a role. Parents typically have the authority to make decisions about their children's exposure, especially in public spaces like YouTube. So, the author's position is about safeguarding the kids' future, which is a common concern in parenting.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil suggests a possible misunderstanding or miscommunication. The author's intent is to protect, not control. It's possible that the fianc\u00e9 feels her creative expression is being stifled, but the author's priority is the children's safety.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's concerns are valid, so they might not be in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's right to create content is balanced against the children's right to privacy and protection. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
