The author is concerned about the kids being exposed to bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being controlling.\n\nFirst, parental rights usually include making decisions to protect children's well-being. The author's concerns about privacy and safety are valid. However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative freedom is being restricted. But when it comes to children, parents generally have the right to set boundaries for their protection. The author didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just not with the kids. That seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil and controlling seems harsh, maybe overreacting. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
