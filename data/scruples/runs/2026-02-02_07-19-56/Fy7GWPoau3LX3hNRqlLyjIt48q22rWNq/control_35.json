      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog that includes their kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author controlling and evil, but the author hasn't stopped her from doing her own videos, just not with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is concerned about the kids being exposed to bullying and overexposure online. That's a valid concern since children in the public eye can face harassment or issues later in life. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children's privacy and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her passion for creating content. That's understandable too. However, including children in such content introduces risks that they might not be aware of or able to consent to, especially if they're minors. The author is setting a boundary to protect the kids, which seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems a bit harsh, calling the author controlling, but the author is not forbidding her entirely\u2014just the part involving the children. \n\nI should also think about consent and the best interests of the children. Minors can't legally consent to being in public content, so the parents have to make that decision. The author is advocating for the kids' privacy and safety, which is a parent's duty. The fianc\u00e9's argument that the author is being controlling might not hold up since the author isn't restricting her own activities, just those involving the kids. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the fianc\u00e9 feels that her creative freedom is being stifled. But when it comes to children, parents often have to balance individual desires with the children's welfare. The author is focusing on the potential harms (bullying, exposure) which are real issues in online spaces. So, the author's stance is about protecting the kids, which is a responsible approach. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a decision based on the children's best interests, even if it means limiting the fianc\u00e9's content creation. The fianc\u00e9's frustration is there, but the author's position is justified in terms of protecting minors from potential risks.\n"
