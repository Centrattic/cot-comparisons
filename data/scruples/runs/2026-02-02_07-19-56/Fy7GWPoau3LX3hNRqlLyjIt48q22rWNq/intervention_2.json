      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids, and the author is against it, citing potential bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights and responsibilities. Both parents have a say in their children's lives, especially when it comes to their well-being. The author is concerned about the kids being exposed to bullying and overexposure, which are valid concerns. Kids on social media can face harassment, privacy issues, etc. So the author's stance is based on protecting the children.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her passion and use her talent. But including children in the content does involve their participation and exposure. The author isn't stopping her from doing her own videos; he's just opposing the inclusion of the kids. That seems reasonable because the children's well-being should be a priority.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author controlling and evil might stem from frustration, but the author's concerns are legitimate. Parents should have a mutual agreement on such matters. The author isn't being controlling without reason; he has specific, valid concerns. So, I think the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
