      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author is concerned about potential bullying and overexposure, while the fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling them controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main argument is about the children's safety and privacy. Kids are vulnerable online, and exposing them to public platforms can have long-term consequences. There's also the risk of bullying or harassment from internet strangers. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own content; they're just asking her not to include the kids. That seems reasonable to protect the children's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her creative freedom is being restricted. She might see sharing their family life as a natural extension of her content. The term \"controlling\" she uses suggests she feels her autonomy is being challenged. However, the author is making a request, not a command. The key here is whether the author's concerns are valid enough to justify the request.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents usually have the right to make decisions about their children's exposure to public platforms. The author, as a parent, is advocating for the children's privacy and safety, which are significant considerations. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling that her career or personal goals are being hindered, but the author's stance is focused on protecting the kids.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. While it's trendy for families to share their lives online, it's a personal choice. The author isn't opposing her career but setting a boundary for their children. The fianc\u00e9 needs to respect that boundary. If there's a compromise, like using the kids' content in a private or anonymous way, but the author is clear in their request, then the fianc\u00e9 might need to find another path for her content.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's concerns are valid and responsible. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be an overreaction if the author isn't preventing her from creating content, just excluding the children. So the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
