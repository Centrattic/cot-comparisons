      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't want their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids, citing potential downsides like bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights and responsibilities. Parents have a duty to protect their children's privacy and well-being. Using kids in public content can expose them to online risks, which is a valid concern. The author is voicing a legitimate worry about their children's safety and future, which is a parent's job.\n\nThen there's the fianc\u00e9's perspective. She wants creative freedom and maybe a new venture. But she's also a parent, and the kids are minors, so their well-being should be a priority. The author isn't stopping her from doing her own videos; it's specifically about involving the kids. That's a key point. The author isn't controlling her personal expression but is focused on protecting the kids.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 calling the author evil and controlling might be an overreaction. Disagreeing on parenting decisions doesn't make someone evil. The author's stance is about protecting the children, which is a common family issue. It's a difference in opinion rather than a clear-cut wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid concerns about their children's privacy and safety. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems harsh given that the author isn't restricting her own activities, just those involving the kids. The answer should be B.\n"
