      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author is concerned about potential bullying and overexposure, while the partner feels controlled and called evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is against including the kids in the videos, not the partner's content overall. They didn't say she can't do her own videos, just not with the kids. The partner, however, is upset and feels controlled. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, protecting children from public exposure and potential negative consequences like bullying is a valid concern. Children can't consent to being part of public content, and their privacy is important. The author's stance seems to prioritize the kids' well-being and safety, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner might feel that her creative or career aspirations are being stifled. But the author isn't stopping her from creating content\u2014it's specifically about involving the kids. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling that her autonomy is being questioned, but the author's main point is about the children's welfare.\n\nI need to check if the author overstepped. Since they're discussing their own children, the author has a right to be concerned about their privacy and safety. The partner's argument that the author is controlling might be a misinterpretation. The author isn't banning her content, just setting boundaries regarding the kids.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate concern for their children's well-being. The partner should respect those boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
