      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog that includes their kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author evil and controlling. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's main concerns are the potential downsides for the kids: bullying, overexposure. These are valid. Kids in the public eye can face a lot of scrutiny, and privacy is a big issue. The author isn't trying to stop the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos, just not including the children. That seems reasonable. But the fianc\u00e9 is pushing back, saying the author is being controlling. \n\nNow, does that make the author wrong? Well, parental concerns about children's privacy are generally considered valid. It's about protecting the kids' future autonomy and safety. The author isn't forbidding the fianc\u00e9 from creating content entirely, just setting a boundary regarding the children's inclusion. That's a common scenario where parents might have differing opinions, but the author's stance is about the kids' well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative freedom is being restricted. However, when it comes to children, parents typically have the right to make decisions in their best interest. The author isn't being controlling in a harmful way, just setting a reasonable limit. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
