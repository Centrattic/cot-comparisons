      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying the author is controlling and evil, but the author is just concerned about the kids' exposure and potential bullying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights and responsibilities. The author is a parent, so they have a duty to protect their children. Including kids in a YouTube channel could expose them to online harassment, privacy issues, and long-term consequences as they grow up. The author's hesitation makes sense from a safety and well-being perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her passion. But does that mean she can include the kids without the other parent's consent? Maybe not. Parenting decisions, especially regarding children's exposure, usually require mutual agreement. The author isn't stopping her from doing her own videos; they're just concerned about involving the kids. That seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about feeling her creative freedom is being restricted. But when children are involved, it's not just about her interests anymore. The kids' best interests should come first. The author is prioritizing their protection, which is a valid parental concern.\n\nSo, the author isn't being controlling out of selfishness but out of concern for the kids. The fianc\u00e9 needs to respect that. There's no clear wrong here because both have valid points, but the author's stance is more about protecting their children, which is a key parental responsibility. So the answer is B.\n"
