      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to create a YouTube channel or vlog that includes their kids. The author is against this because they think it could lead to bullying and overexposure for the children. The fianc\u00e9 accuses the author of being controlling and evil, even though the author didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just that the kids shouldn't be included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is concerned about the children's well-being and potential negative consequences of being on social media. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, wants to pursue her own creative interests, possibly using the kids as content. The conflict is about balancing personal freedom with parental responsibility.\n\nFrom a parental standpoint, protecting children from potential harm makes sense. Exposure on social media can lead to privacy issues, cyberbullying, and long-term effects on the children's lives. The author's stance seems to be rooted in wanting to safeguard their kids, which is a common concern among parents.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her creative expression is being stifled. However, the author is not stopping her from creating content on her own; the issue is specifically about including the children. The accusation of being controlling might be a reaction to the author setting boundaries regarding their children's involvement.\n\nI should also think about the legal aspect. Parents typically have the right to make decisions regarding their children's welfare, including their exposure to public platforms. Unless there's a legal obligation that requires otherwise, the author's decision might be justified.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic between the couple. The fianc\u00e9's reaction (\"evil and controlling\") suggests that there might be underlying issues in their relationship. The author's request is specific and reasonable, but communication might be a problem here. It's possible that the fianc\u00e9 feels her autonomy is being challenged, even if the author's intentions are protective.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, the community often considers the well-being of children as a strong point in favor of the parent who is setting boundaries. The author is not being malicious but is prioritizing the kids' safety. The fianc\u00e9's right to create content is important, but it might not outweigh the potential risks to the children.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely not in the wrong. They are making a reasonable decision based on protecting their children's future, even if it conflicts with the fianc\u00e9's desires. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be an overgeneralization of control rather than addressing the specific concern about the kids.\n"
