      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids, citing concerns about bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is against including the kids in the content, but the fianc\u00e9 wants to do her own videos. The author didn't say she can't do her own videos but specifically asked her not to include the kids. So the author's stance is about the kids' privacy and safety, while the fianc\u00e9 feels her creative freedom is being restricted.\n\nNow, thinking about parental rights and responsibilities. Parents have a duty to protect their children from potential harms, like online bullying or overexposure. So the author's concerns are valid from a protective standpoint. However, the fianc\u00e9 might see this as limiting her ability to pursue her passion or share her life. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is the parent, they have a right to make decisions regarding their children's welfare. The fianc\u00e9's argument that the author is being controlling could be a misunderstanding of the author's intentions. The author isn't forbidding the fianc\u00e9 from vlogging but just not wanting the kids involved. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her autonomy is being restricted. However, when it comes to children, parents typically have the authority to make decisions that protect them, even if it means limiting the other parent's creative expression. \n\nSo, considering the potential risks to the children versus the creative freedom of the fianc\u00e9, the author's concerns seem justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. They are acting in the children's best interest, which is a parent's responsibility.\n"
