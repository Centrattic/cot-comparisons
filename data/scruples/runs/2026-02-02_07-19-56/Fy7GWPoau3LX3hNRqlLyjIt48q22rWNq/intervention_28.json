      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to create a YouTube channel or vlog featuring their kids, but the author is against it due to concerns about bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 accuses the author of being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main concern is the children's well-being, specifically avoiding potential bullying and overexposure. These are valid points; in today's digital age, exposing children online can lead to privacy issues, cyberbullying, and long-term consequences. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos but is specifically against including the kids, which seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her creative freedom or career aspirations are being restricted. She might believe that involving the kids could be a positive experience, teaching them about creativity or providing a shared family activity. However, the author's objection is about the children's safety and privacy, not her personal ambitions. \n\nI need to evaluate if the author's stance is overstepping. The author didn't say she can't do her own videos, just that the kids shouldn't be included. That seems like a boundary about the children's participation rather than controlling her. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil and controlling might be an overreaction if the author isn't actually preventing her from creating content but just setting limits regarding their kids.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, parents often have different views on their children's exposure to social media. While some might support it, others prioritize privacy. The author's position aligns with protecting the children's interests, which is a common parental concern. The fianc\u00e9's accusation of being controlling might stem from feeling her autonomy is challenged, but if she's allowed to do her own content, it's more about the inclusion of the kids rather than her own activities.\n\nSo, considering the balance between creative freedom and child protection, the author's stance seems justified. The key here is that the author isn't restricting the fianc\u00e9's activities but is limiting the involvement of the children. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
