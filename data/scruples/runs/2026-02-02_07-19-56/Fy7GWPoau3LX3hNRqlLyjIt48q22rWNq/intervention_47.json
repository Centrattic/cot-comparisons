      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who doesn't want their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The main concerns are bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 says there's no upside for the kids, but the partner feels the author is being controlling and evil by not allowing it. The author clarifies they didn't say the partner couldn't do her own videos, just not include the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concerns about privacy and safety are valid. Kids on social media can face bullying, harassment, or have their personal information exposed. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children's privacy. However, the fianc\u00e9 wants creative freedom with her content. \n\nThe author is making a boundary about including the kids, which is reasonable because the kids are minors and can't consent to being in videos. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from vlogging on her own, so it's not about controlling her entirely. The conflict here is about the rights of the parents versus the creative desires of the other parent. \n\nIn many cases, parents are expected to make joint decisions about their children's welfare, especially regarding public exposure. The author is trying to protect the kids' privacy, which is a common concern. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil and controlling seems extreme, suggesting that the author's stance is justified. \n\nHowever, perhaps the author could have discussed it more collaboratively, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author is protecting the children's interests without prohibiting the other person's own content, it seems like they're not in the wrong. The key point is the children's well-being versus the partner's content creation. So the answer is probably B (No).\n"
