      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants to start a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids, but the author is against it because they think it could lead to bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being evil and controlling, but the author says they didn't stop her from doing her own videos, just not with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is concerned about their children's well-being, specifically about potential bullying and overexposure. Parenting involves making decisions that protect children's best interests, even if others disagree. However, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue a YouTube channel, which is her right, but using the kids might involve their consent and safety.\n\nThe author didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just not with the kids. That seems reasonable because involving children in such a public platform requires their consent, which they can't give if they're minors. There's a legal aspect too; in many places, minors can't consent to being in public media without parental permission. But the author is the parent, so they have a say here.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author controlling. The author's stance is about protecting the kids, not controlling her. It's a question of parental rights versus personal freedom. The author is trying to protect the children's future, possibly from digital footprints that could affect them later. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel her creative or career aspirations are being stifled.\n\nI should also think about the ethical side. Parents are responsible for their children's welfare. Allowing them to be on YouTube might expose them to inappropriate comments, predators, or long-term privacy issues. The author's concerns are valid and common in parenting. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is about her own desires, but when it comes to the children, their parents have the final say.\n\nBut maybe the fianc\u00e9 is also a parent, so she might not have the right to use the children without the other parent's consent. So the author is in the right to object. The key is that the kids' interests come first. The author isn't preventing her from doing her own videos, just setting a boundary regarding the children. That seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author evil might be an overreaction, but her feelings are hurt because her partner is limiting her creative expression. However, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing the children's privacy and safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their concerns are valid, and they have the right to set boundaries regarding their children's exposure. The answer should be B (No).\n"
