      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is the fianc\u00e9 of someone who wants to start a YouTube channel or vlog featuring their kids. The author is against it because they think it could lead to bullying and overexposure, while the fianc\u00e9 says the author is being controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from making videos for themselves, just not including the kids. The main concern is the children's privacy and safety. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels restricted. \n\nNow, from a child's perspective, being on social media can indeed have risks like bullying, exposure to inappropriate content, or even identity theft. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children, so the author's concern might be valid. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that the author is being too controlling. \n\nBut the author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from creating content themselves, just not involving the kids. That seems reasonable because the kids can't consent to being on YouTube. The parent's role here is to make decisions in the kids' best interest. So maybe the author isn't wrong here. But maybe there's a communication issue. Perhaps the author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective or didn't explain the reasons properly. However, the main point is about the kids' well-being. \n\nIn some cases, parents might agree on using social media for their kids for creative or educational purposes, but that requires mutual agreement. If the author is firmly against it, they have a right to that stance since they're the parent. The fianc\u00e9 might feel disrespected, but the author's priority is the kids' safety. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because protecting the children from potential harm is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's accusation of being controlling might be valid if the author is overstepping, but since the author is only opposing the involvement of the kids, not the content itself, it's more about protecting the children. The key here is the children's welfare versus the fianc\u00e9's creative freedom. Parental rights usually include making decisions about their children's exposure, so the author is in the right.\n"
