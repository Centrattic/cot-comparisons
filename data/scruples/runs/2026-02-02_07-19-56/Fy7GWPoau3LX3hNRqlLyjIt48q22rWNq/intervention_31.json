      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to start a YouTube channel or vlog that includes their kids, but the author is against it because of potential bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author evil and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is concerned about the kids' well-being, which is a parent's natural instinct. Privacy and safety are big issues these days, especially with children. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, wants to pursue her passion for creating content, possibly as a career move or for personal fulfillment. She might feel that her partner is being overly restrictive without considering her needs.\n\nThe author didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just that the kids shouldn't be included. That's a distinction. However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is dismissing her goals or not supporting her, even if he's not outright blocking her. The key here is consent and compromise. The author's concern is valid, but the fianc\u00e9's right to pursue her interests (without involving the kids) should also be considered.\n\nIn such cases, communication is crucial. The author's position might be seen as protective, but if it's causing conflict, there might be a need to find a middle ground. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to protect the kids, but the way the situation is handled could be the issue. If the author is rigid and not allowing the fianc\u00e9 to express herself without the kids, that could be problematic. The fianc\u00e9 might feel her autonomy is being infringed upon, even if it's for a good reason.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, parental concerns are valid. On the other, the fianc\u00e9's feelings and aspirations matter. The answer depends on whether the author is being unreasonable in his stance without considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective. If the author is open to discussion but firm on the kids being excluded, maybe not in the wrong. But if he's being dismissive, then maybe. The question states the author didn't say she couldn't do her own videos, just not with the kids. So the author is not in the wrong because he's allowing her to do her own content. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling him evil and controlling might be an overreaction if he's not blocking her entirely. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
