      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to start a YouTube channel with their kids, and the author doesn't want the kids involved. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling them evil and controlling. The user wants to know if the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is against including their kids in the vlogs, concerned about bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 feels they're being controlling, even though the author didn't stop her from making her own videos. \n\nSo, from a parental perspective, protecting children from potential online dangers makes sense. Kids on social media can face privacy issues, cyberbullying, etc. The author is voicing their concerns, which is a responsible action. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about personal freedom, but the author is focusing on the children's welfare. Since the kids aren't adults yet, their consent isn't really possible. The author's stance is about safeguarding their future, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's pushback might stem from wanting to pursue her passion, but the author's objection is about the children's well-being. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a reasonable argument based on protecting their children. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be an overreaction if she's not considering the risks. So the answer is B.\n"
