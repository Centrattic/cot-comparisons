      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting their kids to be on a YouTube channel or vlog. The fianc\u00e9 argues that there's no upside and it could lead to bullying and overexposure. The other person says the author is controlling and evil for not allowing it.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about parental concerns versus creative freedom. The author is worried about the kids' well-being, potential bullying, and exposure. The fianc\u00e9 wants to do the vlogs but include the kids. The author didn't say they couldn't do their own videos, just not with the kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's concerns. Children on social media can indeed be risky. There's the issue of privacy, safety, and the long-term effects of being in the public eye. Bullying is a real risk, especially online. The author is trying to protect their children from these potential harms.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that their creative expression is being stifled. Maybe they see the channel as a way to share their life, build a community, or even monetize their content. However, the author is not blocking the fianc\u00e9 from creating content, just the inclusion of the kids. So the author isn't entirely preventing the activity, just setting boundaries.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of their relationship. The fianc\u00e9 labels the author as controlling and evil, which might indicate a deeper conflict. But the author's stance seems reasonable from a parenting perspective. They're prioritizing the children's safety over the fianc\u00e9's desires. \n\nI should also think about the age of the kids. If they're very young, the concerns are more pressing. Older kids might have more say, but the post doesn't specify. The author isn't forbidding the fianc\u00e9 from vlogging; it's specifically about including the children. That seems like a reasonable boundary. \n\nIn most cases, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's exposure to public platforms. The fianc\u00e9 might need to find a way to pursue their vlogging without involving the kids. The author's position isn't about controlling the fianc\u00e9 entirely but about protecting the children. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's concerns are valid and they're setting a boundary that's in the best interest of the children. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems a bit extreme, given that the author isn't stopping them from doing the vlogs themselves. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
