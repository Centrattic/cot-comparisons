      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author is concerned about potential bullying and overexposure for the kids. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights and the children's best interests. The author isn't stopping the fianc\u00e9 from making her own videos, just not including the kids. Parents generally have the right to make decisions about their children's exposure, especially regarding privacy and safety. The author's concerns about bullying and overexposure are valid, as kids in the public eye can face harassment or unwanted attention. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have her own creative or career aspirations. But when it comes to involving children, the primary consideration should be their well-being. The author is trying to protect the kids, which is a common parental role. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author \"evil\" seems extreme. The author didn't say no to her doing her own content, just that the kids shouldn't be involved. So the author's position seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
