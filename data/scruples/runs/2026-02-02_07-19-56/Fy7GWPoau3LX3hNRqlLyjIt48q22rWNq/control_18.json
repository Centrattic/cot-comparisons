      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong regarding their fianc\u00e9 wanting to start a YouTube channel with their kids. The author is against including the kids, citing potential bullying and overexposure, while the fianc\u00e9 feels controlled and calls the author evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is concerned about the children's privacy and safety, which are valid concerns. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children from potential harms like online bullying or exposure to inappropriate content. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue a creative or career endeavor, which is her right. But when it involves children, the decision isn't solely hers. \n\nThe author didn't say she can't do her own videos, just that she shouldn't include the kids. That seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9 is framing it as the author being controlling, but the author's stance is about the children's well-being. Legally and ethically, parents usually have a say in decisions affecting their children, especially minors. So the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the kids' privacy and safety. The conflict here is between the fianc\u00e9's creative freedom and the children's protection. Since the author is opposing the inclusion of children specifically, not her right to create content, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
