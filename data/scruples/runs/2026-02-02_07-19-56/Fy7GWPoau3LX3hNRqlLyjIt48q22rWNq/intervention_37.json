      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author is concerned about potential bullying and overexposure, while the fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main concern is their kids' safety and privacy. They don't want the children exposed to online risks like bullying or unwanted attention. That makes sense, especially since kids can't consent to being on social media. Their argument is valid, as many experts advise against putting children in such situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to pursue her passion for creating content. She might see it as a way to share her experiences or build a career. She feels the author is controlling because he's limiting her creative freedom. However, the author isn't stopping her from doing her own videos; he's only objecting to including the kids. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author is overstepping. Since the kids are minors, the parents are responsible for their well-being. The author is making a decision that's in the children's best interest. The fianc\u00e9's frustration might stem from feeling her ambitions are being restricted, but the author's stance is about protecting their children. \n\nSo, considering the children's safety versus the fianc\u00e9's creative desires, the author's position is more about protecting the kids. Unless there's a legal or agreed-upon arrangement that allows the fianc\u00e9 to include the kids, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
