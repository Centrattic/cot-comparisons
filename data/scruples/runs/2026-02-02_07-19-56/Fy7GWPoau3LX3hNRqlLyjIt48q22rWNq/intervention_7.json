I, in no way, said anything about her not doing her own videos, but asked her to not include them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking about whether the author of a Reddit-style question is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who doesn't want their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The author is worried about the kids being bullied or overexposed. The fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being evil and controlling. The author says they didn't stop her from doing her own videos but just don't want the kids involved.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about the children's privacy and safety. That's a valid concern. Kids on social media can face bullying, have their personal info exposed, etc. So the author's worries aren't baseless.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants to do something creative. It's her right to pursue her interests, but maybe she's not considering the kids' well-being. The key here is that they're parents, so the kids' best interests should come first.\n\nThe author didn't say she can't do videos in general, just not with the kids. That seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9 is calling the author controlling, but the author is actually trying to protect their children. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels her autonomy is being restricted, but when it comes to children, parents usually make joint decisions. Unless there's a legal custody arrangement, they co-parent, so both have a say in what's best for the kids.\n\nSo, the author's stance makes sense. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems a bit over the top. She's not being denied her own content, just the inclusion of the kids. The author isn't being evil, just protective. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
