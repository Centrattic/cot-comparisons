      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to start a YouTube channel or vlog that includes their kids. The author is against it because he thinks there's no upside and it could lead to bullying or overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 is calling him controlling and evil for not allowing her to do what she wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights and the children's welfare. As a parent, you have a responsibility to protect your kids. Using minors in online content can definitely have risks like exposure to the public, potential for bullying, and long-term privacy issues. The author is trying to prevent that, which seems like a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that she has the right to pursue her passion and that the author is being overprotective. But since the kids are involved, it's not just about her desire. The author isn't stopping her from doing her own videos; he's specifically asking her not to include the children. That seems reasonable because the kids' well-being is at stake.\n\nI should also think about the dynamics between the couple. If they can't agree on something significant like this, it might cause tension. But the author's stance is based on protecting their children, which is a common parental concern. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling him evil and controlling could be an overreaction if the author isn't infringing on her rights but is instead prioritizing the kids' safety.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, parents are the legal guardians and have the authority to make decisions regarding their children's exposure. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that decision. The fianc\u00e9 might need to find another way to express her creativity without involving the kids. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong because he's acting in the best interest of the children. The answer should be B.\n"
