      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who is against their partner creating a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The main concerns are about potential bullying and overexposure. The partner feels the author is being controlling and evil. The author clarifies they don't mind the partner doing her own videos but wants the kids excluded.\n\nHmm, the first thing I need to consider is the parents' right to decide what's best for their children. Privacy and safety are big issues here. Kids on social media can face risks like cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, or identity theft. The author's concerns are valid and common in today's digital age. Many parents restrict their kids' online presence for these reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner wants to pursue her passion and share their family life. But the key point is whether the kids are involved. If the kids are minors, the parents (both of them) have a shared responsibility in making decisions about their children's welfare. The author isn't stopping the partner from creating content for herself; they're only asking that the kids not be included. That seems reasonable. \n\nThe partner's reaction of calling the author controlling and evil might be an overreaction. Disagreeing on parenting decisions doesn't automatically make someone controlling. The author is advocating for their child's privacy and safety, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nI should also check if there's any legal aspect. In many places, parents have the legal right to make decisions about their children's online presence. So, the author's stance isn't just about personal feelings but also about protecting their children legally and ethically.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the partner believes that involving the kids could have educational or entertainment benefits, and they feel their creativity is being stifled. However, the author's priority is safety, which is a higher priority in parenting. Plus, the author isn't opposing the partner's content entirely, just the inclusion of the children. That seems fair.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author should discuss this with their partner, explain their concerns, and maybe find a compromise. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong. Since the author is asserting their right to protect the children, they aren't necessarily wrong. The partner's frustration is understandable, but it's about balancing rights and responsibilities as parents.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's concerns are valid, they are not preventing the partner from doing her own videos, and they are focused on the children's well-being. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
