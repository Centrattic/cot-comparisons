      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't want their fianc\u00e9 to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids involved, citing potential downsides like bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author controlling and evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concerns are legitimate. Kids on social media can face privacy issues, cyberbullying, and the long-term effects of being online from a young age. Parents often have the right to protect their children's privacy and well-being. The author is not stopping the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own videos; they just want the kids excluded. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might see this as an infringement on her creative freedom or her desire to share their family life. She might feel that the author is being overly protective or not trusting her judgment. But the main issue here is about the children's welfare. The author's stance is about protecting the kids, not controlling the fianc\u00e9. The question is whether that's a valid concern or if the author is being too controlling.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations support parental rights to make decisions for their children's safety. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their kids' privacy and safety. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be based on feeling restricted, but the author's intent is protective. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
