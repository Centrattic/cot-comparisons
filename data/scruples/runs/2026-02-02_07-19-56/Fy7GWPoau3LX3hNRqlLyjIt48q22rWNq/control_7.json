      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The person is a fianc\u00e9 who doesn't want their partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids. The main concerns are potential bullying and overexposure. The partner feels the author is being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have shared custody or decision-making rights over their children. The author is voicing a concern about the children's well-being, which is a valid parental concern. Exposure on social media can indeed lead to privacy issues and bullying, which are real risks. The author isn't stopping the partner from creating content themselves, just not involving the kids, which seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, the partner feels controlled. It's important to communicate these concerns without being overbearing. Maybe the author should discuss the reasons thoroughly with the partner, ensuring mutual understanding. But the author's stance isn't about controlling the partner but protecting the children. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not because they're prioritizing the kids' safety. The answer would be B.\n"
