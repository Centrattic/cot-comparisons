      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want the partner to create a YouTube channel or vlog with their kids, citing potential bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 argues that the author is being controlling and evil, while the author clarifies they didn't want her to do her own videos but just not include the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is concerned about the children's privacy and safety. Parents often have different opinions on how much their kids should be exposed to public platforms. The fianc\u00e9's intention might be to share their lives, but the author is worried about the negative aspects. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being overcontrolling. The author is not saying no to the fianc\u00e9's content creation, just not involving the kids. That seems reasonable. However, relationships require compromise. If the author is being too restrictive without valid reasons, that could be an issue. But in this case, the author does have valid concerns about bullying and exposure. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 is calling the author evil and controlling, which seems like a strong reaction. Maybe she's not considering the author's valid points. The author is setting boundaries regarding the children, which is their right as a parent. Unless there's a legal aspect or the author is denying the partner all creative freedom, which isn't the case here, the author isn't in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
