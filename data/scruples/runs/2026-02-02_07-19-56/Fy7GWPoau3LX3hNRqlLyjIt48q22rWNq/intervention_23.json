      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to create a YouTube channel or vlog including their kids, but the author is against it. The author thinks there's no upside and it could lead to bullying and overexposure. The fianc\u00e9 says the author is being evil and controlling.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I should consider the arguments from both sides. The author is concerned about the children's privacy and potential risks like bullying. Parental concern for their kids' well-being is valid. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is being overly controlling, especially since they're in a relationship and the author didn't outright stop her from doing her own videos, just the ones with the kids. \n\nBut the key here is the children's best interests. Parents have a responsibility to protect their kids from potential harms, even if it means limiting the other parent's creative or career aspirations. The author isn't preventing the fianc\u00e9 from doing her own content without the kids, so it's a reasonable boundary. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author \"evil\" seems harsh, which might indicate she's not considering the author's valid concerns. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground, like getting the kids' consent when they're older or being cautious about the content. But since the kids are presumably young, the author is right to be cautious. The fianc\u00e9's desire to vlog might conflict with the children's need for privacy. \n\nSo, weighing the arguments, the author's stance is about protecting their kids, which is a parent's duty. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about control and possibly not respecting the author's valid concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
