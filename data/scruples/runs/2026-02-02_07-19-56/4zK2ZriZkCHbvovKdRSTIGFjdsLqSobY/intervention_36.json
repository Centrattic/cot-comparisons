She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their best friend Jason and his ex Tessa. The author was concerned about Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior, which caused problems with their friendship. They tried to talk to Jason, but he defended Tessa. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and wanted Jason to cut off contact. Eventually, the author saw Tessa on a date with someone else, sent a picture to Jason, leading to a breakup. The author feels happy about getting Jason back as a friend but is conflicted about feeling more glad than sorry for Jason's heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's initial concern was valid because Tessa was being controlling. The author tried to warn Jason, which is a responsible action. However, when the author saw Tessa with another guy and sent the photo, maybe that's where things could go wrong. Did the author have the right to do that? They weren't part of the relationship, so interfering might be overstepping. But they did it out of concern for Jason. Then, after the breakup, the author's reaction of being happy and feeling more relieved than empathetic might be the main point of conflict.\n\nIs it wrong to feel happy when someone else's problems are resolved, especially if those problems were affecting you? The author's friends were affected by Tessa's behavior, so getting Jason back is positive. But feeling secret joy at someone else's heartbreak, even if the other person was the one being problematic, might be seen as harsh. However, the author had valid reasons to dislike Tessa's actions. Also, Jason was the one who broke up with her, so the author didn't cause it directly. The author's role was more of a concerned friend. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they acted out of care for Jason and their circle. But some might argue that taking a picture and sending it was an invasion of privacy or that they shouldn't take sides. However, since the guy turned out to be the ex, maybe the situation was more complicated. The author might have made a mistake in judgment there. But considering the overall situation, the author's happiness is a natural reaction to seeing a toxic relationship end. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
