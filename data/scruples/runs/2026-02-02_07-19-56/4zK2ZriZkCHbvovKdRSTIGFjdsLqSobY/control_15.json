She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. The key points here are the author's feelings towards Jason's ex, Tessa, and how they reacted.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Tessa became very controlling after dating Jason. She didn't want to hang out with other girls or friends with girlfriends because she thought they wanted Jason. The author tried to warn Jason, who made excuses for her. Then Tessa started cutting the author out and trying to get Jason to stop seeing the author. Jason stood up for the author, so that's a point in his favor.\n\nThen the author sees Tessa on a date with another guy and sends a picture to Jason. The situation escalates, leading to the breakup. The author feels bad for Jason but secretly is happy because their friend is getting hurt. The author is conflicted about feeling glad that their friends get Jason back versus feeling bad for him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for feeling happy and even celebrating the breakup. The user is asking if the author is an asshole (AITA) for this.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's feelings are understandable given Tessa's behavior. Tessa's actions were toxic, and the author had legitimate concerns about Jason being in a bad relationship. However, the author did take a step by telling Jason about the red flags, which Jason dismissed. Then the author sent a photo of Tessa with another guy, which might have been a harsh action to take, even if it led to the breakup.\n\nThe key here is the author's reaction after the breakup. Feeling happy that Jason is no longer with someone who was toxic could be justified. But the author's secret joy and celebration (like dancing and singing) might come off as insensitive, especially since Jason was heartbroken. Even though Tessa was a problematic partner, the author's happiness at Jason's expense could be seen as unkind. However, since the author was concerned about Jason and tried to help before, their feelings might be more justified.\n\nSo, the author's actions leading up to the breakup were in good faith, but their reaction in the aftermath might be crossing a line. However, given the context of a toxic relationship, the author's happiness could be seen as a natural response after seeing Jason suffer. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to protect Jason from a bad situation and their happiness is a result of seeing their friend's well-being restored.\n"
