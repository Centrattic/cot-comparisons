She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The question is whether they should be considered an asshole (AITA) for being happy that their friend's relationship ended.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's best friend, Jason, was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's behavior becoming controlling and jealous after she started dating Jason. The author tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed the concerns. Tessa then began isolating Jason from his friends, especially the author. Later, the author found out that Tessa was cheating with her ex, sent the photo to Jason, which led to the breakup. The author feels happy that Jason is free again but is conflicted about feeling glad he's heartbroken.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's actions and their justification. The author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's red flags, which was in his best interest. When Tessa started cutting the author off, Jason stood by his friend. Then, when the author discovered the cheating, sending the photo was a way to inform Jason, which is understandable. The author's happiness comes from the fact that Jason is now free from a toxic relationship, and the friends can reconnect. \n\nThe main ethical consideration is whether the author's actions were justified. Warning a friend about a partner's problematic behavior is usually seen as a good friend action. The author didn't have malicious intent; they wanted Jason to leave a harmful relationship. The fact that the author felt happy after the breakup, knowing the relationship was bad, is a natural reaction. The author isn't the one who broke up the relationship; they just provided evidence of the cheating. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They were supporting their friend and the relationship ended because of Tessa's actions, not the author's. \n\nPossible counterarguments might say that the author was too happy about Jason's heartbreak, but it's part of the emotional process. It's also possible that the author exaggerated the happiness, but given the context of the toxic relationship, their reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
