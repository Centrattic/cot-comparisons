She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that their best friend Jason was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. The writer, who's a close friend, noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior over time, like not wanting to hang out with groups where there were other women because they \"wanted Jason,\" and isolating Jason from other friends. The writer confronted Jason, who dismissed it, and then Tessa started avoiding the writer and pushing Jason away. Later, the writer catches Tessa on a date with someone else and sends a photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. Jason was heartbroken, but the writer feels happy about the breakup because they're glad to have Jason back, feeling more relieved than sad for him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether they are (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the writer did something wrong. The key points are: \n\n1. The writer observed Tessa's red flags and tried to warn Jason, but he didn't listen. Then, when Tessa started pushing the writer away, Jason resisted. \n\n2. The writer saw Tessa with another guy, took a photo, and sent it to Jason. Jason confronted them, leading to a breakup. \n\n3. The writer feels happy about the breakup, even celebrating it by dancing and singing. \n\nThe writer's actions might be justified in terms of trying to help a friend. However, sending the photo could be seen as an invasion of privacy or interfering in Jason's relationship. Even if Tessa was cheating, the writer's role in exposing it might be problematic if they weren't in a position to do so. \n\nBut the writer's main conflict is feeling more relieved about the breakup than sorry for Jason. Is that wrong? Emotionally, it's human to feel relieved when a toxic situation ends, especially if they've been through the stress of seeing a friend unhappy. However, the writer might be in the wrong if their happiness stems from schadenfreude or if they took actions that directly caused harm.\n\nThe writer sent the photo, which led to the confrontation. While cheating is a valid reason for a breakup, the writer's intervention might have accelerated the end. If the writer's actions were necessary to expose the cheating, maybe not wrong. But if they took it upon themselves without Jason's consent, that's where the line could be crossed. \n\nAlso, the writer's celebration could be seen as insensitive, but maybe not in the wrong. People have different reactions. The key is whether the writer acted unethically or crossed boundaries. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers intentions and actions. The writer tried to help Jason before, so their intention was to protect their friend. When Tessa cheated, the writer exposed it, which could be seen as justified. Feeling happy about Jason getting back his social life and maybe avoiding a bad marriage is understandable. \n\nBut there's a question about how the writer handled it. Did they have the right to send the photo? If Jason had already broken up with Tessa before the photo was sent, maybe not. But in this case, Jason was still with Tessa when the writer sent the photo. However, the cheating was real, so the writer's action was to prevent further harm. \n\nThe writer's feelings might be valid. The problem is whether they did something that's considered wrong. If the action of exposing the cheating was necessary, maybe not. The celebration part might be seen as harsh, but it's common in AITA scenarios where people feel relieved. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the writer's actions were to help a friend and expose infidelity, which is a legitimate issue. The happiness comes from seeing a friend escape a toxic relationship, which is a valid reaction. The writer did what they did with the intention of helping Jason, and the breakup was a result of Tessa's actions, not the writer's. The writer isn't responsible for Tessa's cheating, just for exposing it once they saw it. So the answer is B.\n"
