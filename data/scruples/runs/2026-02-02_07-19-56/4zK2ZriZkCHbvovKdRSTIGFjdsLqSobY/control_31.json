She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Jason was in a relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior, like not wanting to hang out with other friends and isolating Jason. The author tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed the concerns. Then, Tessa started cutting the author out and trying to get Jason to stop seeing them. \n\nLater, the author saw Tessa on a date with another guy and sent a picture to Jason. The situation escalated into a breakup. The author felt bad for Jason at first but secretly was happy because they believed Tessa was toxic. Now, the author is conflicted between feeling guilty and being relieved.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's intentions and actions. The author tried to help Jason by pointing out Tessa's red flags, which seems supportive. But after the breakup, the author felt happy, even celebrating. \n\nThe ethical part is about whether being happy about someone's misfortune makes you an asshole. If the author genuinely believed Tessa was bad for Jason and tried to help, maybe their happiness is justified. However, maybe the author should have been more supportive of Jason during the breakup instead of feeling relieved. The line between supporting a friend and taking joy in their pain is thin. \n\nAlso, the author sent the photo of Tessa with another guy, which might have contributed to the breakup. That action could be seen as interfering in Jason's relationship. But the author's original intent was to help Jason by exposing infidelity. \n\nThe moral here is tricky. The author might not be entirely at fault if they were trying to protect their friend from a toxic relationship. However, being happy about the breakup, especially if it caused Jason emotional pain, could make the author seem insensitive. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were justified. Since the author tried to help Jason before, the post-breakup happiness might be a natural reaction, but it's important to consider how it affects the friendship. The author might not be in the wrong, but they should also support Jason through the healing process.\n"
