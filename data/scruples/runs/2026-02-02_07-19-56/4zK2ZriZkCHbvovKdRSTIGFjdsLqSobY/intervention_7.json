She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author's best friend Jason, who was in a relationship with Tessa. Tessa's behavior became problematic over time, like being overly jealous and isolating Jason from friends. The author tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed it. Then the author saw Tessa on a date with a guy, which led to a breakup. The author felt happy about the breakup and even celebrated, which is making them question their own feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was a friend who tried to warn Jason about Tessa's red flags. They were concerned about Jason's well-being, so their initial attempts to help are understandable. But when Jason didn't take their advice, the author had to deal with Tessa cutting off interactions. Then, the author took a photo of Tessa with another man and sent it to Jason. That action might be questionable because even if Tessa was in the wrong, sending a picture without knowing the context could be invading her privacy or causing unnecessary conflict. However, the situation was validated when Tessa was actually cheating, so maybe the author's action was justified.\n\nNow, the author's feelings of being happy about the breakup and celebrating are the main issue here. The user is asking if the author is an asshole for feeling that way. On one hand, the author was concerned about Jason's happiness and the toxic relationship. Jason was planning to propose, which shows the relationship was serious. The author's happiness might stem from seeing Jason finally free from an unhealthy situation. But on the other hand, the author is a friend who should be supportive regardless of their personal opinions. Even if the relationship was bad, the breakup is painful for Jason, and the author's celebration might come off as insensitive.\n\nAnother angle is the author's role in exposing the cheating. While it might have been a necessary action to reveal the truth, it's possible that the author overstepped by taking a picture and sending it, which could be seen as intrusive. This might have contributed to Tessa's breakdown and the subsequent shouting match. So, their methods could be questionable, but the intention was to help.\n\nThe conflict arises in the author's emotional response. Friends should empathize with each other during tough times. Even if the author believes the breakup was for the best, expressing joy over a friend's heartbreak could damage their friendship. The author might need to balance their relief that the toxic relationship is over with empathy for Jason's pain. The key here is whether the author can support Jason through his grief, even while feeling the relationship was harmful.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't a bad person for being relieved, but their reaction might be inconsiderate. The line between being right about the relationship's issues and being insensitive to Jason's emotions is thin. The answer depends on whether one prioritizes the friend's well-being and the method of intervention versus the emotional support needed post-breakup.\n"
