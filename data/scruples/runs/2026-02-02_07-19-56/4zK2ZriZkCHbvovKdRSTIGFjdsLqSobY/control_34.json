She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being happy that their friend Jason's relationship with Tessa ended. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that Tessa's behavior changed after she started dating Jason. She became jealous and excluded others. Jason made excuses for her, but the author confronted him. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and trying to cut off their friendship. The author caught Tessa on a date with her ex, sent a picture to Jason, and the relationship ended. The author feels happy that Jason is back, even though he's heartbroken.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author do something wrong? The author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's red flags, which seems reasonable. When Tessa tried to cut the author out, Jason stood by the author. The author's actions led to the breakup, but it was because Tessa was cheating. The author is happy the relationship ended because their friend is better off, and they had a good relationship before.\n\nIs it wrong to be happy about the breakup? The author didn't cheat or do anything harmful. They tried to help Jason. Even though the author felt bad initially, their true feelings were about wanting their friend back. The situation might not be the author's fault since Tessa was the one cheating. The author's actions were in good faith to support Jason. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
