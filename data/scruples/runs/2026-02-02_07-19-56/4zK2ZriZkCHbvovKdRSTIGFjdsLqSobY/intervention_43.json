She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about the author (AITA) being happy that their best friend Jason's relationship ended.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior from the start. Tessa became jealous, excluded other friends, and tried to isolate Jason. The author confronted Jason, who defended her. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and tried to get Jason to cut ties. Later, the author catches Tessa on a date with her ex, leading to the breakup. The author feels bad for Jason but is secretly happy the relationship is over. The conflict is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The author's actions: they confronted Jason, which is reasonable. Then, when they saw Tessa with the ex, they sent the picture to Jason. That's a bit tricky. Even though it led to the breakup, the author had a right to be concerned. However, the author might have overstepped by spying or sending a photo, which could be invasive. But in this case, it's a public place, so maybe not. \n\nThe author's feelings after the breakup are what's in question. Feeling relieved that the toxic relationship ended isn't necessarily wrong. However, being \"happy\" someone else is heartbroken might be seen as insensitive. The key is whether the author acted wrongly or just has valid feelings. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The author's intentions were to help their friend. The actions taken were to inform Jason, which led to the breakup. Feeling happy that a harmful relationship ended could be justified if the relationship was toxic. But the fact that they felt \"secretly glad\" and celebrated might come off as cruel, even if their initial concerns were valid. \n\nThe line between concern and overreach: Did the author cross it? The sending of the photo could be seen as meddling, but it's also a form of support. The author's relief is a natural reaction if they saw the relationship as destructive. So, is the author in the wrong? The answer might be A (yes) because they took action that led to the breakup, which caused Jason pain, even if it was for a good reason. Or B (no) because the relationship was unhealthy, and they had the author's best interest at heart. \n\nIn the end, the main question is whether being happy about a friend's breakup is wrong. If the relationship was harmful, the author's happiness might be justified. However, the celebration of someone else's pain could be seen as wrong. The answer is likely A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they acted out of care, even if the feelings are mixed.\n"
