She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, Jason's girlfriend Tessa started acting jealous and controlling after they got together. The author, their friend, warned Jason about Tessa's behavior, but Jason defended her. Then Tessa started avoiding hanging out with the author and tried to get Jason to cut ties. The author found Tessa on a date with another guy, which led to a breakup. The author felt happy because they thought Tessa was a bad influence, but now they're conflicted about whether they're an asshole for feeling that way.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the author's intentions and actions. The author tried to warn Jason before, which was a good thing. They sent a photo when they saw Tessa with another guy, which might have been a way to expose the cheating. But was that the right approach? If Tessa was actually cheating, then the author's action might have been justified. However, the author was happy that Jason was hurt, which could be seen as cruel. But maybe the author's happiness comes from seeing Jason free from an abusive or toxic relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author did try to help Jason before, but when they saw Tessa cheating, sending the photo was a way to confront the issue. Even if it caused immediate pain, maybe the author's intentions were good. The moral conflict here is between loyalty to a friend and the friend's well-being. The author's actions might have been necessary to reveal the truth, even if it was painful. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by sending the photo without giving Tessa a chance to explain. But given Tessa's previous behavior, maybe the author had reason to act. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their friend avoid a harmful relationship. Even though they felt happy about the breakup, their actions were aimed at protecting Jason from someone who was controlling and unfaithful. The answer is B.\n"
