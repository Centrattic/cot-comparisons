She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves their best friend Jason being in a relationship with Tessa, which the author found problematic. Tessa's behavior became controlling and jealous, and the author had warned Jason, but he didn't listen. Then, the author found out Tessa was cheating with her ex, told Jason, and the relationship ended. Now the author is happy because Jason is back to being single and they get him back as a friend, but feels guilty for not feeling bad about Jason's heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The key points are: the author confronted Jason about Tessa's red flags, which was the right thing to do. Then, when Tessa started cutting off interactions, the author didn't continue to push Jason beyond that. When the cheating happened, the author provided evidence, which led to the breakup. The author's happiness is because the toxic relationship is over and their friend is back. \n\nBut is it wrong to be happy about someone else's breakup? Well, the author did care enough to warn Jason, and the relationship was harmful. Feeling relieved that a friend isn't in a toxic situation anymore isn't inherently wrong. However, being happy about Jason's heartbreak might be the issue. But the story says the author felt terrible for Jason but secretly happy. The conflict is between their genuine happiness for the friend's freedom and guilt over Jason's pain.\n\nThe question is whether the author acted wrong. They didn't cause the breakup; they just provided the evidence. Their actions were in line with supporting a friend. The jealousy and control of Tessa were toxic. So the author's actions were justified, and their happiness is a natural response to a friend being freed from a bad relationship. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They did the right thing by supporting Jason, even if they felt conflicted emotions.\n"
