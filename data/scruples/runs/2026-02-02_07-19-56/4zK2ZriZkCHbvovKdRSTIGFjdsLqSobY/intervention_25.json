She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, let's call them \"the writer,\" is best friends with Jason. Jason was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. Initially, Tessa seemed cool, but after they started dating, her behavior changed. She became very jealous, avoiding situations where there were other girls around because she thought they wanted Jason. She also didn't want to hang out with friends who had girlfriends, fearing other women might be around Jason. The writer talked to Jason about this, pointing out red flags, but Jason made excuses for Tessa. After that, Tessa refused to hang out with the writer and tried to get Jason to cut off the writer. Jason stood up for the writer, though.\n\nThen, the writer saw Tessa on a date with a guy they didn't recognize at a date spot. They took a picture and sent it to Jason. Jason reacted by showing up, leading to a fight where Tessa denied it, but the guy contradicted her, and Tessa accused the writer of ruining things. After packing up Tessa's stuff, Jason was heartbroken, planning to propose. The writer felt bad for Jason but secretly was happy because they could have Jason back in their lives. Now, they're conflicted, wondering if they're an asshole for feeling that way.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Let's break down actions and motivations. The writer's role here is as a concerned friend. They tried to warn Jason about Tessa's red flags, which is reasonable. However, when they saw Tessa on a date, they sent a picture to Jason. That action might have contributed to the breakup. Then, after the breakup, the writer feels happy, which is the conflict point.\n\nIs the writer responsible for the breakup? Well, they took action by informing Jason, but Jason was already in the process of discovering the infidelity (since Tessa's ex was present and called her out). The writer's action might have been a catalyst, but the main issue was Tessa's cheating. The writer's happiness stems from their friend regaining his social circle and being free from a toxic relationship. However, they also feel bad for Jason's heartbreak. \n\nThe question is whether being happy about the breakup makes the writer an asshole. The writer's actions were based on genuine concern initially, but the feeling of happiness after the breakup could be seen as cruel. However, it's also natural to feel relief when a toxic relationship ends, especially when it affects your own friendships. The writer tried to be supportive but their friend ended up being hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer's action of sending the photo might have exacerbated the situation. If Jason was already planning to propose, the public confrontation and packing up Tessa's stuff might have been harsh. But the writer might not be responsible for how Jason reacted. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the writer acted out of concern, but the result was Jason's heartbreak. However, the writer's happiness isn't malicious; it's a reaction to the situation. It's possible that the writer isn't in the wrong, as they tried to help and the breakup was inevitable due to Tessa's actions. Alternatively, if the writer's actions directly caused the breakup (by sending the photo), they might feel some guilt. But the main issue is their emotional reaction after the fact.\n\nI think the key here is whether the writer intentionally caused the breakup. If the writer's action was necessary to expose the cheating, then their happiness might be justified. However, if their action was unnecessary or done with malice, it's different. The scenario suggests that the writer acted out of concern, even if they were a bit vindictive in sending the photo (though they justified it as helping Jason). The emotional response of happiness could be seen as insensitive, but maybe not entirely wrong since the relationship was toxic.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer might be B (the writer is not in the wrong), because their actions were based on genuine concern and the relationship was problematic. However, the happiness about the breakup might be seen as a bit harsh, but not necessarily making them an asshole. Alternatively, maybe A (they are in the wrong) because they took actions that directly led to the breakup. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again.\n\nThe user says they think the writer is in the wrong. Their reasoning might be that the writer took a direct action (sending the photo) that caused the breakup, and then felt happy about it, which is unkind. But the writer's actions were intended to help. The line is between helping a friend and causing harm. If the writer's action was justified (exposing cheating), then perhaps they're not at fault. But if they sent the photo without giving Tessa a chance to explain, maybe they are. However, Tessa was cheating, so the action was justifiable. The writer's happiness is a natural reaction to their friend's situation improving. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
