She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. The author's best friend Jason was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. Initially, Tessa seemed cool but after dating Jason, she became very controlling and jealous. She started avoiding social situations where other girls were present, fearing they wanted Jason. The author tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed the concerns. Tessa then started cutting off the author and even tried to get Jason to stop hanging out with them. Eventually, the author caught Tessa on a date with her ex, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they feel happy that Jason is back and their social circle is intact, but also guilty for not feeling sorry for Jason's heartbreak. The key points here are the author's actions and their feelings. \n\nFirst, the author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's red flags, which is a responsible action. They didn't take any further steps beyond that, so they aren't directly responsible for the breakup. However, when they saw Tessa with her ex, they sent the picture to Jason, which led to the confrontation. The author's intention here might have been to alert Jason, but it also played a role in ending the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling happy about the breakup. The author isn't the one who broke up with Tessa, nor did they cause the infidelity. The breakup was a result of Tessa's actions. The author's happiness stems from their friends getting Jason back, which is understandable given Tessa's controlling behavior. However, the author might be in the wrong if their actions were vindictive or if they intentionally sabotaged the relationship. \n\nLooking at the situation, the author's main goal was to protect their friend, not to cause harm. They tried to help before, and their actions led to the truth coming out. However, using the photo to expose Tessa could be seen as harsh, but it's also a way to prevent Jason from being hurt further. The mixed feelings the author has are natural; they care about Jason but also about their own social dynamics. \n\nThe key here is intent. The author's intent was to protect Jason, not to ruin the relationship for their own benefit. The guilt comes from feeling that they might have crossed a line, but their actions were based on concern. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as their actions were driven by care for their friend's well-being, even if they felt happy about the outcome.\n"
