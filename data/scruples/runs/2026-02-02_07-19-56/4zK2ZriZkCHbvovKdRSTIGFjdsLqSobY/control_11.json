She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Jason was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior early on. The author confronted Jason about it, but Jason made excuses. Tessa then started avoiding the author and trying to cut the author out of her relationship. Eventually, Jason caught Tessa cheating with her ex, leading to the breakup. The author felt glad because they got their friend back and were secretly happy about the breakup, even acting out by dancing and singing. Now the author feels conflicted about their reaction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The author had legitimate concerns about Tessa's behavior and tried to warn Jason. They were also a victim of Tessa's attempts to isolate Jason from them. When the breakup happened because Tessa cheated, the author's happiness stems from feeling relieved that Jason is no longer in a toxic relationship. The author's actions (sending the photo) were justified because Tessa was cheating. Also, the author supported Jason during the breakup, showing they care about his well-being.\n\nHowever, the author's public celebration might be seen as harsh, especially if Jason is still emotionally hurt. But given the context\u2014Tessa's cheating and the prior toxic behavior\u2014the author's happiness isn't malicious. It's more about the relief of a friendship being restored. The author isn't the one who broke up the couple; they just helped expose the infidelity. So, their reaction, while maybe insensitive in the moment, isn't wrong given the circumstances. The author's actions were in self-defense and to protect their friend's well-being. Therefore, the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
