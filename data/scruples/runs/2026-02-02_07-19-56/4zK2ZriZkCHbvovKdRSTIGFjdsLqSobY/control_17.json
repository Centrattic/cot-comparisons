She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author being happy that their best friend's relationship ended because the girlfriend was toxic and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend Jason was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. Initially, Tessa was cool, but after dating Jason, she became jealous and controlling, avoiding hanging out with certain people because of other women. The author warned Jason, who dismissed the concerns. Tessa then started avoiding the author and tried to cut ties. The author later saw Tessa on a date with her ex, sent a picture to Jason, leading to a breakup. The author feels relieved that Jason is back, but is conflicted about being happy over his heartbreak.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the author's actions. They tried to warn Jason about Tessa's red flags, which could be seen as caring. However, they took the photo and sent it to Jason, which might have contributed to the breakup. Tessa was with someone else, so maybe the author's actions were justified. But was sending the photo a good idea? Maybe the author should have let Jason handle it himself. However, given Tessa's controlling behavior, the author might have felt it was necessary. \n\nEmotionally, the author feels more relief than sympathy for Jason. Is that being an asshole? Well, the author's primary concern was their friend's well-being and their own social circle. If Tessa was toxic, then the author's happiness might be a natural reaction. \n\nBut there's a line. The author might have overstepped by sending the photo, but if Tessa was cheating, then it's not their fault. However, the author might have wanted the relationship to end, which is where the conflict lies. The key is whether the author's actions were justified. Since Tessa was cheating, the author's role in exposing it might be seen as right. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to warn Jason, and when that failed, they took action when they found out about the cheating. Their happiness could be because they believed the relationship was harmful. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's a point where the author acted inconsiderately. Sending the photo might have been a mistake, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. So, the answer is B.\n"
