She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about being happy that their best friend's relationship ended because the girlfriend was acting jealous and controlling. The author tried to warn Jason but didn't confront him directly, then later sent a photo of the girlfriend with someone else, which led to the breakup. The conflict is between the author's relief that Jason is free again and their guilt over being happy about Jason's heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's intentions were to help Jason by pointing out Tessa's red flags. However, when they found out about the cheating, they sent the photo to Jason. That action directly led to the breakup. Was that right? Maybe, since cheating is a valid reason for ending a relationship, but the method might be questionable. Did the author have the right to take that action without discussing it with Jason first? That's a point of contention.\n\nThen, after the breakup, the author celebrated, which might seem insensitive. But they also mention feeling terrible for Jason. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified in exposing the cheating. If Tessa was indeed cheating, then the author might have done the right thing to save Jason from a toxic relationship. However, the way they handled it\u2014sending a photo without confrontation\u2014could be seen as manipulative. Also, the author's happiness at the breakup might stem from seeing Jason's relationship as harmful to their friendship.\n\nAnother angle: the author's initial warnings were dismissed by Jason. When Tessa started cutting them out, the author was relieved when the relationship ended, possibly because it restored their friendship. But does that justify the actions taken? It's a mix of concern for a friend and personal satisfaction. The line between helping and interfering is thin here.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, being happy about the breakup might not make the author an asshole if they genuinely believed they were saving their friend from a bad situation. However, the method of intervention (sending a photo) could be problematic. The author might not be in the wrong if their actions were based on Tessa's infidelity, but the initial celebration of Jason's heartbreak could be seen as cruel. Yet, given the context of Tessa's behavior and Jason's plan to propose, the author's actions could be viewed as necessary, even if their celebration was inappropriate.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but it's a close call. The key points are the justification of exposing the cheating and the intent to help Jason, even if the celebration was a bit insensitive.\n"
