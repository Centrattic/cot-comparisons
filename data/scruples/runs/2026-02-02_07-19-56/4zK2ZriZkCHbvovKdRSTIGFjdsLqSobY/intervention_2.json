She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being happy about their friend's breakup. The story is that Jason's girlfriend Tessa became controlling and jealous, leading to the breakup. The author sent a picture of Tessa with her ex to Jason, which led to the breakup. Now the author feels conflicted between being happy their friend is free and feeling bad for Jason.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions. The author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's behavior before, but he didn't listen. Then, when the author saw Tessa with her ex, they sent the picture. Was that the right move? Maybe, because Jason had the chance to confront the situation. But the author's main issue is feeling happy about the breakup. \n\nIs it wrong to be happy when a friend's bad relationship ends? If the relationship was harmful, maybe not. The author's motivation was concern for Jason, which is understandable. However, the method of sending the picture might have been harsh, but the outcome was Jason realizing the truth. The author's celebration might be seen as insensitive, but given the prior issues, perhaps it's justified. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The author did intervene when they saw something wrong. While their happiness could be seen as a bit cruel, the underlying reasons are based on seeing a friend in a toxic relationship. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a line between being happy for the friend's freedom and being happy that they're suffering. The author admits to feeling glad their friends get Jason back, which is positive. The guilt comes from the negative emotions Jason is experiencing. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions were to protect their friend from a bad relationship. Even though they sent the picture, which might have been a direct approach, the outcome was positive for Jason in the long run. The joy at the breakup isn't malicious; it's relief that Jason is free from a toxic situation. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
