She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend Jason was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's controlling behavior after she started dating Jason, like being jealous of other girls and cutting off friends. The author warned Jason, who made excuses for Tessa. Then Tessa started refusing to hang out with the author and tried to get Jason to stop seeing them. Eventually, the author caught Tessa on a date with her ex, which led to the breakup. The author felt happy about the breakup, even celebrating it, and now feels conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author did the right thing by pointing out Tessa's red flags. They supported Jason by standing up to her attempts to isolate them. The author's actions led to the breakup, which might have been beneficial for Jason in the long run. The happiness at the breakup could stem from seeing Jason happy again and the toxic relationship ending. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be feeling guilty because they secretly took pleasure in Jason's pain. The author sent the photo to Jason, which led to the confrontation. Even though Tessa was abusive, the author's actions directly contributed to the breakup. However, if the author believed they were helping Jason escape a bad situation, their happiness could be justified as relief rather than malicious joy.\n\nI need to consider the moral aspect. Is it wrong to be happy about a breakup if the relationship was harmful? The author's initial concerns were valid, so their actions were protective. The celebration might be a reaction to Jason being freed from a toxic relationship. However, taking pleasure in someone's suffering, even if justified, can be seen as unkind. But since the author's intention was to help, maybe their happiness is understandable.\n\nThe key is the intention. If the author was just glad that Jason was out of a bad situation, then they're not in the wrong. But if they took pleasure in Jason's heartbreak unnecessarily, that's different. The story suggests the relationship was harmful, so the author's happiness is more about seeing a positive outcome.\n"
