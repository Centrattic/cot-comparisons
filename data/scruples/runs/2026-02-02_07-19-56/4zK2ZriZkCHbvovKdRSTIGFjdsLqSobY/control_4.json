She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their best friend Jason and his girlfriend Tessa. The user, who's the author of the question, is asking if they're an asshole for being happy that Tessa and Jason broke up.\n\nFirst, let me go through the details. The author was friends with Jason before he started dating Tessa. At first, Tessa was cool, but after they got together, she became really jealous. She didn't want to hang out with groups that had other girls or friends who had girlfriends because she thought other women wanted Jason. The author tried to talk to Jason about these red flags, but he made excuses for Tessa. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and trying to get Jason to cut off contact. Jason stood up for the author, which is good. \n\nLater, the author saw Tessa on a date with another guy (her ex) and sent a picture to Jason, leading to a breakup. The author felt bad for Jason at first but secretly was happy because they think Jason was in a bad relationship and now he's free to hang out with his friends again. The author's mixed feelings are leading them to question if they're an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for feeling happy about the breakup. \n\nLet me break it down. Tessa's behavior was controlling and jealous, which is definitely unhealthy. The author tried to warn Jason, and even though Jason initially dismissed it, the outcome was Tessa cheating or lying (since she was with her ex). The author's actions in sending the photo were to protect their friend, which is understandable. However, the author's feeling of happiness might be seen as insensitivity towards Jason's hurt. \n\nBut wait, the author was a victim of Tessa's manipulation too, trying to get Jason to cut them off. So maybe their relief is valid because they were also affected. Also, seeing someone in an abusive or toxic relationship can make friends feel relieved when it ends, especially if they knew there were issues. The author wasn't the one who broke them up; it was Tessa's actions leading to Jason ending things. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by sending the picture. But given Tessa's controlling behavior and the fact that she was cheating, maybe that was justified. The key point is whether the author's happiness is wrong. People often feel happy when a friend is freed from a toxic relationship, even if they feel bad about the friend's pain. It's a complex mix of emotions.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, the author isn't the one who caused the breakup. They tried to help before, and the breakup was due to Tessa's actions. The author's reaction is a natural consequence of seeing their friend in a bad situation. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't wrong. They're justified in feeling relieved and happy that Jason is free from a toxic relationship, even if they feel bad about his heartbreak.\n"
