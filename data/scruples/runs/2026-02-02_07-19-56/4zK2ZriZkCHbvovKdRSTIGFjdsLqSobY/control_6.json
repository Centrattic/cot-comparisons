She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author is friends with Jason, who was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. Tessa initially seemed okay but became very jealous and controlling. The author pointed out red flags to Jason, but he made excuses for her. Tessa then started avoiding the author and trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with him. Jason stood up for the friendship. Later, the author sees Tessa on a date with a guy and sends the picture to Jason. It turns out the guy is her ex, and Tessa was lying about being broken up with Jason. There's a confrontation, Tessa acts shocked, and the breakup happens. The author feels bad for Jason but secretly is happy, even celebrating by dancing and singing. The author is conflicted about whether they're an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned about Jason's well-being and points out Tessa's problematic behavior. That seems reasonable. Friends often do this when they see red flags. But then, when the author sees Tessa with another guy, they send the picture to Jason. Is that justified? Well, if Tessa was still in a relationship with Jason, sending the picture to confront her about cheating is a way to protect Jason. However, the guy turned out to be her ex, and Tessa was lying about being broken up with Jason. So maybe Tessa was already in the process of cheating or manipulating the situation.\n\nThe author's actions led to Jason's heartbreak, but they also helped him see the truth. The author feels happy because the toxic relationship ended, and their friendship with Jason is restored. The conflict is between feeling bad for Jason and being glad the relationship is over.\n\nIs it wrong to be happy about the breakup? The author was concerned about Jason's well-being and had already tried to warn him. The breakup might have been inevitable, so the author's actions might have just accelerated it. However, the method of sending the photo could be seen as an invasion of privacy or contributing to the breakup. But since Tessa was cheating, maybe it was justified.\n\nAlso, the author's celebration (\"ding dong the witch is dead\") might be insensitive to Jason's feelings. Even though the relationship was toxic, the author's public celebration might be hurtful. However, the author did feel terrible for Jason, which shows some empathy.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help Jason by exposing Tessa's infidelity and controlling behavior. The happiness comes from seeing the toxic relationship end, which is understandable. But there's a fine line between being supportive and being a bit of a jerk in the way they celebrated. However, given the context, the author's actions were in good faith, even if the celebration was a bit over the top. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
