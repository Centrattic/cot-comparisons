She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend Jason's breakup with Tessa, and the author's reaction to it.\n\nFirst, the author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior early on. They confronted him, but he dismissed their concerns. The author then stopped pushing, which seems reasonable because there's a limit to how much you can intervene in a friend's relationship without overstepping.\n\nThen, the author discovered Tessa cheating and sent the photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. The author felt guilty for being happy about the breakup and even celebrated by singing \"ding dong the witch is dead.\" The main question is whether this makes the author an asshole.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. They had a valid concern about Tessa's behavior, which they raised with Jason. When Tessa started cutting the author off and trying to isolate Jason, that's a red flag. The author then acted on seeing Tessa with another guy, which is a clear infidelity. Sending the photo was a direct way to confront the situation, but was it right?\n\nHowever, the author's celebration might come off as insensitive. Even though Tessa's behavior was toxic, the author's friend Jason was hurt. The author might be right in wanting to protect their friend, but celebrating the breakup could be seen as taking joy in someone else's pain. But it's also possible that the author genuinely wanted to help their friend and saw the breakup as a positive outcome.\n\nThe key points are whether the author overstepped by sending the photo (which was a factual discovery) and whether their celebration is morally wrong. Since Tessa was cheating, the author's action in revealing it was for the truth. The celebration might be seen as justified if the author believed they saved their friend from a bad relationship. However, the insensitivity of the celebration could be a point against them.\n\nOverall, the author had good intentions and acted when they saw clear evidence of a problem. They tried to warn Jason before, so their actions weren't malicious. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
