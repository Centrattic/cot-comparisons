She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend's relationship ended. The situation involves the author's friend Jason and his girlfriend Tessa. From the story, Tessa's behavior became increasingly controlling and jealous after she started dating Jason. The author tried to warn Jason but was dismissed. Tessa then cut off contact with the author and tried to get Jason to stop seeing them. Later, the author found Tessa on a date with someone else, which led to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings of being happy about the breakup. The question is whether that makes them an asshole. To determine this, I need to consider the context. Tessa's actions were manipulative and controlling, which negatively affected Jason's relationship with friends. The author had valid concerns and tried to help Jason before the breakup. After the breakup, the author might feel vindicated because their warnings were right. However, feeling happy about a friend's heartbreak is complicated. Even if the relationship was unhealthy, the author's friend is going through emotional pain. The author's reaction includes dancing and singing, which might be seen as insensitive. But the underlying reason is that the author wants Jason to be happy and be back in their life, which is a positive intent. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling that way? Maybe not necessarily. People can have mixed emotions\u2014sad for their friend's pain but relieved that an unhealthy relationship is over. However, the public celebration (\"ding dong the witch is dead\") might be considered harsh, especially if Jason is still hurting. But the story mentions that the author took care of Jason after the breakup, which shows they care. The conflict here is between the author's genuine feelings and social expectations. In the AITA format, the community often looks at intentions and whether the person acted wrongly. The author didn't do anything malicious; they provided information when they saw Tessa cheating. Their happiness is a reaction to events, not an action they caused. So, while the emotions might make them feel guilty, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
