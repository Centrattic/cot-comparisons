She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend's relationship ended. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author is a best friend of Jason. Tessa, Jason's girlfriend, started becoming controlling after they became a couple. She didn't want to hang out with other girls, and then even with friends who had boyfriends, fearing other women around Jason. The author tried to warn Jason, but he made excuses for her. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and tried to get Jason to cut ties. Jason stood up for the author, so maybe he wasn't completely controlled.\n\nThen the author catches Tessa on a date with her ex while she's still with Jason. The author sends the picture, leading to a confrontation where Tessa denies it, but the ex proves she's lying. The fight escalates, and Tessa blames the author. They break up, and the author feels happy because they get their friend back, even though Jason is heartbroken.\n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA) for feeling happy. \n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author do something wrong? Well, the author tried to warn Jason before, and when that didn't work, they took action by sending the photo. That confrontation led to the breakup. The author was justified in wanting to protect their friend from a toxic relationship. Tessa's behavior was controlling and manipulative, which is harmful. The author's actions might have been necessary to help Jason see the truth. Feeling happy that the toxic relationship ended is understandable, especially if it was causing Jason and others stress. \n\nBut wait, did the author cross a line by taking the photo and sending it? That's a tricky part. Snitching on someone by taking a picture without their consent could be seen as invading privacy. But in this case, Tessa was cheating, so maybe the author had a valid reason. The ex's testimony confirmed the cheating, so the author's action led to the truth coming out. Jason ended up leaving Tessa, which was necessary for his well-being.\n\nThe conflict here is between helping a friend and respecting privacy. The author's intentions were to help Jason, which is commendable. Even though the method might be questionable, the outcome was positive. The author feels conflicted because they're happy about the outcome but also guilty about Jason's heartbreak. However, from the information given, it seems like the author was trying to protect their friend and others from a toxic relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their actions were aimed at helping Jason by exposing the cheating and controlling behavior, even though the method might have been a bit harsh. The happiness comes from seeing a friend happy and healthy, which is a valid reaction.\n"
