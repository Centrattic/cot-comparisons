She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling happy that their friend's relationship ended. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Jason was in a bad relationship with Tessa. The author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior, but Jason didn't listen. Then Tessa started cutting the author off and trying to get Jason to cut ties. The author later found out Tessa was cheating with her ex, sent the photo to Jason, which led to the breakup.\n\nThe author feels conflicted because they're happy to have Jason back but also feel guilty for not feeling more sorry for him. The question is whether the author is an asshole for feeling this way.\n\nHmm. So, the author was concerned about Jason's well-being and tried to help. They confronted Jason about Tessa's red flags, which is a responsible action. When Tessa started isolating them, the author was protected by Jason. Then, when they found out about the cheating, they took action to help end the relationship. The author's happiness comes from seeing Jason free from a toxic relationship, which is understandable. But they're worried about being selfish or cruel for not feeling more sympathy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they acted in what they believed was Jason's best interest. They didn't provoke the cheating; that was Tessa's choice. The author's actions were to expose the infidelity, which is justified. Feeling relieved that a friend isn't in a harmful relationship isn't inherently wrong. People can have mixed emotions\u2014sad for the friend but happy for the friend's future. The key is whether the author's actions were malicious. Here, they were trying to help. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They supported their friend through a tough time and had valid reasons to feel happy about the breakup.\n"
