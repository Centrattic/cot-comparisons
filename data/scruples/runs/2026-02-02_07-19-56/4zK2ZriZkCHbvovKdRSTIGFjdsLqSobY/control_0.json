She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the story again to understand the situation.\n\nThe main issue is that the author is happy their best friend Jason's relationship with Tessa ended. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior, like being overly jealous and excluding friends. They told Jason, who made excuses for Tessa. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and tried to get Jason to stop hanging out with them. Later, the author saw Tessa on a date with someone else and sent a picture to Jason. It turned out she was cheating with her ex, who had already broken up with her. The breakup happened, and the author felt happy about it, even celebrating, which is making them question if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The key points here are the author's actions in exposing the cheating and their emotional reaction to the breakup. \n\nThe author took a picture of Tessa with another guy and sent it to Jason. That act could be seen as interfering in the relationship. But considering Tessa was cheating, maybe it was justified to inform Jason. The author might have felt it was the right thing to do to protect their friend from being cheated on. However, the method of sending a photo without a conversation could come off as harsh, but the intent was to warn Jason about the infidelity.\n\nThe author's happiness about the breakup is where the conflict lies. They feel guilty for being relieved that Jason's toxic relationship is over and that their social circle can reconnect. The question is whether feeling happy about someone else's misfortune makes you an asshole. \n\nThe author's concerns about Tessa's behavior were valid, and they tried to warn Jason before. So their actions were based on trying to help. The subsequent cheating confirmed those concerns. The author's celebration might be seen as cruel, but it's also a natural reaction to seeing a bad situation resolved. However, being happy that someone is hurt might be considered unkind.\n\nBut Jason was the one who was heartbroken, not the author. The author's role was to support Jason, and their actions led to the breakup. However, the author's secret happiness could be seen as not being supportive. On the other hand, if the relationship was indeed harmful, the author's relief is understandable.\n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and the context. The author's primary concern was for their friend's well-being. They tried to help Jason before and after the relationship. The celebration might be insensitive, but the underlying actions were to help. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if their celebration was mocking Jason's pain, that's different. However, the story says Jason was heartbroken, but the author felt more relieved about the friends getting Jason back. So it's more about the social aspect and Jason's happiness. The answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong, because their actions were to help and their happiness stems from seeing a toxic relationship end.\n"
