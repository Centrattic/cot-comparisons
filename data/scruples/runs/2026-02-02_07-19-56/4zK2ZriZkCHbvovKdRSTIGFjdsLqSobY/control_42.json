She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from different angles. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior from the start. They tried to warn Jason, who didn't listen. Then Tessa started cutting the author out and trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with them. The author caught Tessa on a date with her ex, sent the picture to Jason, which led to the breakup.\n\nNow, the author feels happy because they think they've saved their friend from a bad relationship. They also had a history of Tessa isolating Jason and the author from their social circle. The key points here are the author's intentions: they were trying to support Jason by pointing out red flags. Their happiness comes from seeing Jason maybe free from a toxic situation, even if it hurt him emotionally.\n\nBut there's the act of sending the photo. Was that justified? The author might have crossed a line there. However, they had prior issues with Tessa's manipulative behavior. The justification could be that they were trying to help Jason, even if the method was questionable.\n\nEmotionally, feeling happy when someone you care about is heartbroken is complex. But the author's primary concern was their friend's well-being. The problem arises if their happiness is malicious or if they enjoyed Jason's pain. But the narrative suggests they felt terrible for Jason, just also relieved that the toxic person was out of the picture.\n\nThe question is whether their actions were wrong. The act of sending the photo might be a gray area, but the overall intent was protective. The author isn't directly responsible for the breakup, just for exposing the infidelity. So, while the method might be debatable, the emotional reaction of being happy isn't inherently wrong if it's about reclaiming the friendship and seeing the end of a harmful relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions, while possibly overstepping, were motivated by concern. Their feelings of happiness stem from a positive outcome for their friend's social and emotional health. So, answer B.\n"
