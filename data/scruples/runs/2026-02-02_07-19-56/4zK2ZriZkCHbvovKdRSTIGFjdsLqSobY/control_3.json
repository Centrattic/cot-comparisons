She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being happy that their best friend Jason's relationship ended.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. Jason was in a 2-year relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior, like avoiding friends because they might be a threat to the relationship. The author warned Jason, who dismissed the concerns. Then Tessa started isolating the author from Jason, but Jason stood up for their friendship. Later, the author saw Tessa on a date with her ex and sent a photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. Now the author feels conflicted between feeling responsible for Jason's heartbreak and being happy to have Jason back as a friend.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and their moral implications. The author confronted Jason about Tessa's red flags, which seems reasonable. When Tessa started isolating the author, Jason protected the friendship. Then the author saw Tessa with her ex and shared the photo, which led to the breakup. The author's reaction of celebration feels wrong because they might be taking pleasure in someone's pain. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? The initial warning to Jason was appropriate. Sending the photo was a factual action to expose Tessa's infidelity. However, the author's personal joy at Jason's heartbreak could be seen as insensitive. Even though Tessa was controlling, the author's happiness about her being \"the witch\" might indicate a lack of empathy toward Jason. \n\nIs it wrong to feel relieved when a toxic relationship ends, especially when it's affecting your own friendship? The author had valid concerns and acted in good faith. However, taking pleasure in someone's pain, even if they were wronged, can be seen as unkind. The line between supporting a friend and being an asshole is thin here. The author's actions were justified in stopping the toxic relationship, but their emotional reaction might be where the issue lies. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to help Jason, but the celebration might be the problem. Alternatively, if the author didn't directly cause the breakup beyond exposing the infidelity, which Jason himself addressed, then the author isn't in the wrong for feeling happy about the outcome. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They tried to help Jason, and the breakup was due to Tessa's actions. The author's happiness comes from seeing Jason's friendship restored, which is a positive. However, the celebration of the breakup might be a personal choice, but not morally wrong since they did the right thing in confronting the toxic behavior. The author's actions were in Jason's best interest, even if the emotional reaction seems harsh.\n"
