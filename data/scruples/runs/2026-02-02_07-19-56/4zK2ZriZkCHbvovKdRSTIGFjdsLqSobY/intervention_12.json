She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jason's girlfriend Tessa became controlling and jealous after they started dating. The author tried to warn Jason, but he didn't listen. Then Tessa started cutting the author off and trying to get Jason to stop seeing them. The author found out Tessa was dating her ex, which led to the breakup. The author is happy the relationship ended because they miss having Jason back, but feel guilty for not feeling bad about Jason's heartbreak.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. The user thinks they are, but the assistant needs to decide.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and their actions. The author tried to help Jason by pointing out the red flags in Tessa's behavior. They weren't the one to end the relationship; it was Tessa cheating. The author sent a picture of Tessa with her ex, which led to the confrontation. But the author didn't initiate the breakup. They felt happy when the relationship ended, but that's a natural reaction if the other person's behavior was causing harm. \n\nIs it wrong to feel relieved and happy when a friend is freed from a toxic relationship? The author's primary concern was Jason's well-being, even if they were conflicted. The fact that they felt terrible for Jason when he was heartbroken but also glad the toxic situation ended shows complexity. However, the author's public celebration (\"ding dong the witch is dead\") might be seen as insensitive, especially right after the breakup. But maybe it's just their way of processing relief.\n\nIn the end, the author's actions were in good faith. They tried to help, and the relationship ended due to Tessa's infidelity. The author's happiness isn't malicious; it's about their friend being free from a harmful relationship. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But maybe the celebration was a mistake. However, the main question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't at fault for feeling happy about a positive outcome for their friend, even if the friend is hurting.\n"
