She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. \n\nFirst, the background: Jason's girlfriend Tessa became possessive and controlling, cutting off friends. The author warned Jason, who dismissed it. Later, the author found out Tessa was cheating with her ex. The author sent the photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. Now the author feels mixed emotions\u2014guilty for Jason's pain but happy he's free from Tessa.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, feeling happy that a toxic relationship ended isn't inherently wrong. Tessa's behavior was harmful, so the breakup might be for the best. The author tried to warn Jason, which shows concern. Sending the photo was a harsh move, but it exposed the infidelity. The author's celebration is a bit extreme, but emotions run high here.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might have crossed a line by taking a picture and sending it. It's invasive and could have escalated things. Also, the author's public celebration (singing \"ding dong the witch is dead\") might come off as insensitive, despite the circumstances. However, the author's motives were to help Jason, which is good. The problem is the method used to expose the infidelity and the public celebration of someone else's pain.\n\nSo, balancing the good intentions against the harsh actions, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the aggressive actions taken and the lack of sensitivity in their celebration. But if we focus on the feelings themselves, it's more about the situation. However, the actions, especially the public shaming and spreading the photo, are questionable. So leaning towards A.\n"
