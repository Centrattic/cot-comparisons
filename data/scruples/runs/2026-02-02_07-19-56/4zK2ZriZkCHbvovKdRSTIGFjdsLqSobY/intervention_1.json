She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nJason was in a 2-year relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's behavior changed after they got together\u2014becoming jealous and controlling. The author warned Jason, who dismissed it. Tessa then started avoiding the author and trying to cut Jason off. Later, the author saw Tessa on a date with a guy, who turned out to be her ex. The author sent a photo to Jason, leading to a breakup. Jason was heartbroken, but the author felt happy and even celebrated.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's main actions: reporting Tessa's date to Jason, which led to the breakup. The author's motivation was concern for Jason and their friend group. However, they felt happy about the breakup, which makes them question their own feelings.\n\nPossible angles: Was it right to confront Jason about Tessa's behavior? Yes, the author was trying to help a friend. Sending the photo was a direct action to expose Tessa's infidelity (or ex's situation). Was that justified? If Tessa was cheating, then the author's actions were in Jason's interest. However, if the author misinterpreted the date as cheating (maybe the ex was just friends), then it's a problem.\n\nIn the story, the ex claims Tessa told him Jason had broken up with her, which Tessa denies. So there's some ambiguity here. The author might have acted on a misunderstanding. But if Tessa was indeed seeing her ex while supposedly in a relationship with Jason, that's betrayal.\n\nThe author's happiness stems from the belief that Jason was being mistreated and is now free. But being happy about someone's pain, even if justified, could be seen as harsh. However, the author's primary concern was Jason's well-being. The conflict arises from the emotional reaction versus the action's intent.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for sending the photo and causing the breakup? If the author acted based on genuine concern and Tessa was indeed unfaithful, then it's justified. But if the author's actions were vindictive, then yes. The story suggests the author was trying to help. The happiness after might be a natural reaction to a toxic relationship ending, not the cause of it. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling relief, as they were supportive of Jason.\n"
