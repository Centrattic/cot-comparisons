She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend's relationship ended. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author's best friend Jason was in a relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's behavior became problematic\u2014she was jealous, excluded others, and eventually refused to hang out with them. The author warned Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa tried to get Jason to cut off the author, but Jason stood by them.\n\nLater, the author saw Tessa on a date with someone else and sent a photo to Jason. It turned out to be her ex, and a confrontation happened. Tessa denied it, but the ex called her out, leading to her breaking down. The author felt responsible for the breakup and, while feeling bad for Jason, was secretly happy. Now, they're conflicted about being glad.\n\nSo, the main question is if the author is wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's actions: They confronted Jason about Tessa's behavior when they noticed red flags. That seems okay. Then, when they found Tessa cheating (or at least getting back with her ex), they informed Jason. Jason's reaction was immediate, leading to the breakup. The author's justification is that they were protecting the friendship and their own social circle.\n\nBut the user is feeling guilty for being happy about the breakup. The key points here are whether the author overstepped by sending the photo, and if their happiness is valid given the circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to help Jason before, and when that failed, they took action again. Sending the photo was a direct action that led to the breakup. However, even if Tessa was cheating, the author's role in exposing it might make them complicit. The question is whether they had the right to do that without Jason's knowledge.\n\nBut Jason's reaction shows he appreciated the information. He confronted her, and the relationship ended. However, the author's celebration might be seen as insensitive. But considering the prior behavior of Tessa, maybe the author's relief is justified. The user's conflict is between sympathy for Jason and relief for the friendship.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoings: The author didn't directly cause the cheating, but their action (sending the photo) was the catalyst. However, Tessa was already on a date with her ex, so the infidelity was there. The author's role is a bit of a gray area. They might be in the right because Tessa's actions were the main issue. The author tried to help Jason, and the breakup was inevitable. Their happiness stems from seeing Jason's friendship restored, which is valid.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If they overstepped by sending the photo without asking, that's a point against them. But if they were justified in exposing the cheating, then they're not wrong. The answer likely depends on whether the action was justified. The user's intentions were to protect Jason, and the outcome was positive despite the emotional cost. So, probably not wrong. Answer B.\n"
