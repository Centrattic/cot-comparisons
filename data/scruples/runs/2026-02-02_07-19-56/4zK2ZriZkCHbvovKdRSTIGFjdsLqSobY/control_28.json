She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about their best friend Jason and his girlfriend Tessa. The author is asking if they're an asshole for being happy that Tessa cheated and the relationship ended.\n\nFirst, I need to look at what the author did. They noticed Tessa's controlling behavior, like not wanting to hang out with other girls or friends with girlfriends because she thought they wanted Jason. The author warned Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and tried to get Jason to cut ties. The author took a picture of Tessa on a date with someone else and sent it to Jason. That led to the breakup.\n\nNow, the author feels conflicted because they're happy their friend is single again, even though Jason is heartbroken. They did try to warn Jason before, so maybe they were right to point out the red flags. But sending the photo might have been a bit extreme. However, since Tessa was cheating, maybe the author did the right thing. \n\nThe key points here are: the author tried to help Jason before by pointing out Tessa's issues, and then acted when they saw her cheating. Even though they felt happy about the breakup, they had good intentions. The author's actions might have been necessary to help their friend. So, is being happy about the outcome wrong? Maybe not if they had valid reasons. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their friend, even if the emotions are complicated.\n"
