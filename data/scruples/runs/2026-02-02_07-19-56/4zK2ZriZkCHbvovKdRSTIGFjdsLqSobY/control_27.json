She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their best friend Jason being in a relationship with Tessa, who over time became very controlling and manipulative. The author tried to warn Jason, but he didn't listen. Then, the author finds out that Tessa is cheating with her ex, which leads to the breakup.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is an asshole for being happy and even celebrating the end of the relationship. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a close friend of Jason. They were concerned about Tessa's behavior early on, pointing out red flags like jealousy and controlling tendencies. Jason didn't take the warnings seriously, which is his choice. The author then tried to stay involved but was pushed away by Tessa. So, the author's initial concern seems valid and caring.\n\nWhen the author discovers Tessa cheating, they send a picture to Jason. That action might be questionable because confronting someone with evidence of a partner's infidelity could be seen as invading privacy or causing harm. However, the author's intention was to protect their friend from further hurt. Even though the method could be debatable, the motive is good.\n\nThe fallout from the confrontation leads to the breakup, and the author feels conflicted. On one hand, they feel bad for Jason because he's heartbroken and had plans to propose. On the other hand, they're happy that Jason is free from what seems like a toxic relationship and that their social circle can reconnect with him. The author's celebration might come off as insensitive, especially since Jason is still in emotional pain.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the intention behind the actions and the relationship dynamics. The author's initial warnings were out of concern, and while sending the picture might not be the best approach, it's understandable in a situation where a friend is being deceived. The fact that Jason later admits Tessa was cheating suggests the author was right in their assessment. However, taking pleasure in someone's misfortune, even if justified, can be seen as unkind. But since the author is a friend, their happiness might stem from knowing Jason was in a harmful situation, not just from malice.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the celebration is seen as cruel or justified relief. Some might argue that it's natural to feel happy when a friend is freed from a toxic relationship, especially after you've tried to help. Others might say that being happy about someone's suffering, even if it's deserved, is unkind. However, in this case, the author isn't causing the breakup directly\u2014they\u2019re reacting to Tessa's actions. The author's role was to support Jason, and now that the relationship ended, their happiness comes from seeing Jason get his life back, not from Tessa's distress. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to help, and their relief is understandable. The answer should be B.\n"
