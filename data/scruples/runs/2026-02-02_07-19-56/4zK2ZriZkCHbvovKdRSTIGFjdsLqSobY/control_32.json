She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the main question is whether it's wrong to be happy that their best friend's relationship ended.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: Jason and Tessa were in a 2-year relationship. The author noticed Tessa's controlling behavior, like not wanting to hang out with other girls because they might want Jason, and trying to get Jason to cut off the author. The author warned Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa became hostile towards the author. Later, the author found out Tessa was cheating with her ex, sent a photo to Jason, leading to a breakup. The author felt happy the relationship ended, even celebrated by dancing and singing, but feels bad for being so glad.\n\nSo, the key points: The author tried to warn Jason, who didn't listen. Tessa was cheating, and the author helped expose it. The author is conflicted between feeling guilty for Jason's heartbreak and happy to have him back as a friend. The question is whether the author is an asshole for feeling that way.\n\nPossible angles: Is it wrong to be happy when a toxic relationship ends? Did the author do the right thing by confronting Jason about Tessa's behavior? Cheating is a big deal, so exposing it might be justified. The author's actions led to the breakup, but they were motivated by concern for Jason's well-being and friendship. However, the author might be overstepping by sending the photo, but in this case, it led to the truth coming out. The author also felt bad for Jason's heartbreak but was glad for the friends getting him back. So, is the author wrong for being happy?\n\nIn terms of morality, if the relationship was harmful to Jason and the author tried to help, then their happiness might be justified. However, if the author's actions were intrusive or caused unnecessary harm, that could be a problem. But in this case, Tessa was cheating, so the author's intervention exposed that. The author's mixed feelings are natural\u2014sympathy for Jason's pain but relief that the toxic relationship ended. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they acted out of concern and the relationship was unhealthy. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
