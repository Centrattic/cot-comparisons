She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about their best friend Jason and his girlfriend Tessa. The author was concerned about Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior from the start. They warned Jason, but he didn't take it seriously. Then, after a while, Tessa starts avoiding the author and trying to get Jason to cut ties. \n\nThe author then sees Tessa on a date with her ex and sends a picture to Jason, leading to a breakup. The author feels happy that Jason is no longer with Tessa, even celebrating by dancing and singing. Now they're conflicted, wondering if they're an asshole for feeling that way.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author tried to warn Jason about red flags, which he ignored. The author then acted when they saw Tessa cheating, which led to the breakup. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being happy about the breakup and for the actions they took.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions were to help a friend. They were concerned about Jason's well-being and pointed out Tessa's toxic behavior. That seems like a good intention. However, when they saw Tessa with her ex, they sent the photo to Jason. While the author might have thought they were protecting Jason, interfering in someone's relationship can be problematic. But in this case, Tessa was cheating, so maybe the author's action was justified.\n\nThe author's celebration of the breakup might seem harsh, especially since Jason was heartbroken. But considering the toxic dynamics and Tessa's controlling behavior, the author's relief is understandable. They were worried about Jason being in a bad relationship and wanted him to return to them as a friend. So, the conflict is between being happy for Jason's freedom from a toxic relationship versus being insensitive to his emotional pain.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't directly responsible for the breakup. The decision to break things off was Jason's once he saw the evidence. The author's role was more of a catalyst by providing the evidence, but the choice was Jason's. The author's feelings of happiness might be seen as selfish if they didn't consider Jason's feelings, but if they believed they were helping him escape a harmful situation, it's more of a justified reaction.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were in good faith and if their happiness is a natural response to seeing a friend leave a toxic relationship. Since the author tried to help, the actions were aimed at protecting Jason, and the celebration isn't malicious, just personal relief, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
