She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend, Jason, whose girlfriend Tessa's behavior became problematic, leading to the relationship ending. The author took a photo of Tessa with another guy, sent it to Jason, which led to the breakup. Now, the author feels happy the relationship is over but is conflicted about their feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author was concerned about Tessa's jealousy and tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed it. Then, when the author caught Tessa on a date with another man, they sent the photo, causing the breakup. The author admits to being happy about the outcome but feels guilty.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFactors to consider: Did the author cross a line by sending the photo? Interfering in a relationship can be iffy. Even if Tessa was cheating, the author might have a right to be concerned as a friend. But taking matters into their own hands by sending the photo could be seen as overstepping. However, the user mentions that Tessa was already causing issues, and the author had warned Jason. The ex's presence complicates things\u2014maybe Tessa was lying about the breakup, so the author had a reason to act. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's happiness might be seen as cruel, but they also had valid reasons. The line between helping a friend and overstepping is blurry here. Some might argue that the author had the right to act if Tessa was genuinely abusive or manipulative. Others might say the author shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to expose the infidelity. \n\nThe author's actions led to the breakup, and while the outcome was positive, the method might be questionable. However, given the context of Tessa's prior behavior and the cheating, the author's intent was to protect their friend. The guilt the author feels might indicate some self-awareness about the possible wrongness of their actions. \n\nBut ultimately, intervening in a relationship is a gray area. If the author had a right to be concerned and the cheating was real, maybe they weren't in the wrong. However, if the method of intervention was inappropriate, then maybe they were. \n\nI think the key here is that the author acted in what they believed was their friend's best interest, even if it meant breaking boundaries. However, since the outcome was the end of an abusive and cheating relationship, the author's actions might be justified. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a chance some would say A because they shouldn't have acted without Jason's consent. It's a tough call. Given the context, maybe B is more appropriate.\n"
