She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their best friend Jason's relationship with Tessa. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior, warned Jason, but he didn't listen. Then the author found out Tessa was cheating, sent a picture to Jason, which led to the breakup. The author feels happy the relationship is over but is conflicted about their own feelings. The user thinks the author is wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I should consider the actions of the author. They tried to warn Jason about Tessa's red flags, which is a responsible action. But when Tessa started cutting the author off, they had to back off. Then, when they saw Tessa cheating, they sent the photo. That part is questionable. Did they have the right to take a picture and send it? Maybe not, because it could be seen as invading privacy or meddling. But they were trying to protect their friend. \n\nThen, when Jason confronted Tessa, the author was present, and Tessa blamed them for ruining everything. The author felt bad for Jason but was secretly happy. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified. They had a concern, tried to help, but went a step too far by taking the photo. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for taking the photo and sending it? That's a gray area. On one hand, they wanted to help Jason. On the other, they might have overstepped. The author's happiness might be because they were right about Tessa, but their happiness at Jason's pain could be seen as cruel. But maybe it's natural to feel relief that a friend isn't with someone harmful.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The answer hinges on the photo and the subsequent actions. If the author had a valid reason (cheating), maybe it's understandable. But the method could be questionable. However, considering the outcome, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help and Tessa was cheating, but the method could be debatable. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the photo was intrusive. But given that the user thinks the author is wrong, but the story shows the author acted in a friend's best interest, maybe B is the answer.\n"
