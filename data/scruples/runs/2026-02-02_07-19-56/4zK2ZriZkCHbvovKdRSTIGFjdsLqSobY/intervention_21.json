She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is happy their best friend's relationship ended because the girlfriend was causing issues with their social circle.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend, Jason, was in a relationship with Tessa. Tessa became possessive and exclusionary after dating Jason, making the group of friends uncomfortable. The author warned Jason, but he didn't listen. Then, Tessa started cutting the author out. Later, the author found out that Tessa was seeing her ex, which led to the breakup. The author felt relieved and even celebrated the breakup, which they're now questioning.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to feel that way. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author was concerned about Jason's well-being and tried to help. They didn't initiate the breakup; they just provided the evidence when they saw the infidelity. The author's happiness comes from the reunion with Jason and the group, not from Tessa's suffering. However, they do feel bad that Jason is heartbroken, but the relief outweighs the guilt.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is intent and actions. The author didn't do anything malicious. They tried to support Jason before, and when they saw the cheating, they did the right thing by informing him. Their celebration was a personal reaction to a positive outcome for their friend. The author isn't responsible for the breakup, so feeling happy isn't necessarily wrong. However, maybe there's a point in sending the photo, but that's a judgment call. Overall, it's a complex mix of emotions, but the author isn't in the wrong for feeling relieved and happy.\n"
