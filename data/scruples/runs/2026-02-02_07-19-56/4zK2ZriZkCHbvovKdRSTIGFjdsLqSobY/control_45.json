She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is about the author being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. The key points are: Tessa's behavior became problematic after she started dating Jason. She became jealous, excluded friends, and tried to cut off the author. Then the author found out Tessa was seeing her ex, leading to the breakup. The author felt bad for Jason initially but secretly was happy because Jason's friends got him back.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA). The options are A or B. \n\nThe author's main conflict is feeling more relieved about getting Jason back than sorry for Jason's pain. They sent a photo of Tessa with her ex, which might have caused the breakup. But Tessa was already manipulative and controlling. The author tried to warn Jason before, but he didn't listen. \n\nIs the author wrong for being happy? Well, people have different reactions. The author was a friend who tried to help and maybe their happiness is because they saw Jason being mistreated. But acting on the photo might have been a mistake. However, Tessa's actions were toxic. The author's intention was to help Jason, even if the method was questionable. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling happy because they were concerned for Jason's well-being. They supported him through the breakup, even if they felt relieved. The key is that the author's actions were driven by wanting to protect their friend from a toxic relationship. Therefore, the author isn't an asshole, so the answer is B.\n"
