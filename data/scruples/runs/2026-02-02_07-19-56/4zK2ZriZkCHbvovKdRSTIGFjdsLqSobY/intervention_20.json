She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended, and even going as far as sending a picture of Jason's girlfriend with another guy, which led to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend Jason was in a relationship with Tessa, who became increasingly controlling, isolating Jason from friends. The author warned Jason, who was dismissive. Then the author took a photo of Tessa with her ex at a date spot and sent it to Jason, causing the breakup. Now, the author feels happy about getting Jason back for their friends and themselves but is conflicted about whether they're an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author in the wrong for being happy and taking action? Let's consider the actions taken. The author took a picture of Tessa with another person and sent it to Jason. That could be seen as an invasion of privacy or interfering in Jason's relationship. But the alternative is that Tessa's behavior was abusive and controlling, so the author was trying to help.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions led to the breakup, which Jason was planning to propose to her. On the other hand, Tessa's behavior was toxic, and the author might have acted out of concern. The key is whether the author overstepped. Taking a photo without consent and sending it could be problematic, but if Tessa was already cheating, maybe the author had a reason. However, the author's reaction\u2014celebrating loudly\u2014might come off as cruel, even if they felt justified.\n\nAlso, the question is about being in the wrong. Even if the author had good intentions, interfering in someone's relationship isn't typically considered acceptable. But if the relationship was harmful, maybe it's justified. However, the author's method might be questionable. They might not be in the wrong if they believed they were helping, but perhaps they crossed a line by taking matters into their own hands.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the justification. If the author's actions were necessary to stop an abusive relationship, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they acted out of spite or without cause, they are. The story presents Tessa as controlling and cheating, so maybe the author had reason. But the method of sending the photo and the celebration could be seen as overstepping. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're not. Hmm. I need to decide between A and B.\n"
