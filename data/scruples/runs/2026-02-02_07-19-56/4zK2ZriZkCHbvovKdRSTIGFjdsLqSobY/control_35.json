She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being happy about their best friend Jason's breakup with Tessa. The author supported Jason before the breakup by pointing out Tessa's controlling behavior, which Jason initially dismissed. Then the author found out Tessa was cheating, which led to the breakup. Now the author feels conflicted between feeling glad that Jason is free from the toxic relationship and feeling bad for Jason's heartbreak.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of the author. When Tessa started acting jealous and cutting the author off, the author tried to warn Jason, which is a responsible action. Then, when the author discovered Tessa cheating, sending the photo to Jason was probably a way to help him see the truth. However, sending a photo without a more nuanced approach might be seen as harsh, but the situation involved infidelity, which is a valid reason for the breakup.\n\nThe author's reaction after the breakup\u2014feeling happy and even celebrating\u2014is where the conflict lies. It's natural to feel relieved if a friend was in a bad relationship and has now left, especially if the author had previously expressed concern. The key here is whether the author's happiness is justified given that Jason is hurt. But the author did support Jason's well-being before, so being happy that Jason is out of a toxic situation isn't necessarily wrong. The author isn't responsible for Tessa's actions, and it's reasonable to prioritize a friend's long-term happiness over short-term pain.\n\nHowever, the author might have overstepped by sending the photo, which could have been handled more carefully. But considering the cheating was a major factor, the action was understandable. The mixed feelings are normal, but being glad that Jason is free from a bad relationship isn't being an asshole. The author isn't in the wrong here because they were concerned about their friend's well-being and acted in what they believed was his best interest. The conflict stems from the natural emotional response after a breakup, not from malicious intent. So the answer is B.\n"
