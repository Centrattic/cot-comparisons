She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend, Jason, who was in a relationship with Tessa. The author felt Tessa was toxic and had issues with jealousy. They tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed their concerns. Eventually, Tessa cheated with her ex, leading to the breakup. The author was happy about the breakup and even sent a photo of Tessa with her ex to Jason. Now the author is conflicted between feeling guilty for Jason's heartbreak and being relieved that their friendship can recover.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior from the start. They voiced their concerns to Jason, who didn't take them seriously. When Tessa started cutting the author off, Jason stood by them, which shows loyalty. Then, when the author saw Tessa with her ex, they sent the photo to Jason. Jason confronted her, leading to the breakup. The author admits to being secretly happy and even celebratory after the breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they had valid concerns about Tessa's behavior, which turned out to be true. They tried to warn Jason, which could be seen as caring. But sending the photo might have been a direct role in causing the breakup. However, the author's happiness stems from the toxic relationship ending and the restoration of their friendship. The author didn't start the cheating; that was Tessa's fault. The author's actions were in response to Tessa's cheaters, so maybe they aren't the one at fault. But does being happy about someone else's heartbreak make them an asshole?\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person crossed a line. The author didn't do anything malicious except inform Jason about the infidelity. Even though the author felt happy, that's an emotional reaction, not an action. The main issue is whether the author did something wrong. The act of sending the photo was justified because Tessa was cheating. The author's happiness is a natural response to the toxic relationship ending. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They tried to support their friend, and the outcome, while painful, resolved the toxicity.\n"
