She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior, which Jason dismissed. Then, the author discovered Tessa cheating with her ex, which led to the breakup. The author sent a photo to Jason, which might have triggered the confrontation. \n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author's happiness and actions are justified. The author's initial concern about Tessa's red flags was valid, and they tried to help Jason. However, when they took a picture of Tessa with another guy and sent it to Jason, that's where things get tricky. Did they have the right to do that without talking to Tessa first? Maybe not. But it's also possible they were trying to protect Jason from being hurt.\n\nThe author's reaction after the breakup\u2014celebrating\u2014could be seen as insensitive. Even if the relationship was toxic, Jason is their friend, and he's heartbroken. Feeling relief that the relationship is over is one thing, but being actively happy about his pain might cross a line. The author might be prioritizing their own social group's happiness over their friend's emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did support Jason during the breakup, staying with him and taking a day off to care for him. That shows they do care. The celebration was a private moment, so maybe it's not entirely wrong to feel that way, especially if they knew the relationship was unhealthy. \n\nBut the act of sending the photo without knowing the full context could have escalated the situation. Jason might have handled the confrontation differently if he had approached it calmly. However, the author's intention was to expose the infidelity, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn the end, it's a mix of actions. The author tried to help, but the method of sending the photo might have been a mistake. The celebration could be seen as insensitive, but given the toxic nature of the relationship, it's understandable. The question is whether the celebration makes them an asshole. It's a nuanced situation where the author's intentions were good, but their actions might have been tactless.\n"
