She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The author is happy that their best friend Jason's relationship with Tessa ended, and they even sent a picture of Tessa on a date with someone else. The key points here are the author's actions and their feelings afterward.\n\nFirst, the author initially warned Jason about Tessa's jealousy and controlling behavior. Jason didn't take the advice, and Tessa started avoiding the author and trying to cut off their friendship. The author then secretly took a photo of Tessa on what seemed like a date and sent it to Jason. The situation escalated, leading to the breakup, and the author felt happy about it. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for being happy and for taking that action. On one hand, the author was concerned about Jason's well-being and had valid reasons to think Tessa was problematic. But sending the picture without Tessa's consent could be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, the author's intention might have been to protect their friend. \n\nBut the author's main conflict is feeling more relieved about getting Jason back than sorry for him. That's where the moral dilemma lies. The author's happiness stems from seeing the end of a toxic relationship, which could be justified. However, the act of intervening might have accelerated Jason's heartbreak. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author had good intentions, the method of sending the photo without context might have been harsh. However, given Tessa's behavior and Jason's denial, the author might have felt it was necessary. The key here is the balance between supporting a friend and respecting others' privacy. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were meant to protect their friend, even if it caused immediate pain. The emotional reaction is a natural response to seeing a friend in a harmful situation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would lean towards B, as the author's intentions were to help a friend, even if the method was questionable.\n"
