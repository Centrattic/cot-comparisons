She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling happy that their friend's relationship ended. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's best friend, Jason, was in a relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior, warned Jason, but he didn't take it seriously. Tessa then started isolating Jason from friends and even the author. Later, the author saw Tessa on a date with her ex, which led to the breakup. The author felt happy the relationship ended, even to the point of celebrating, but is now questioning if they're an asshole for feeling that way.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's red flags, which Jason dismissed. The author's actions in sending the photo might have contributed to the breakup. The author is conflicted between feeling glad for their friend's return and guilt over Jason's heartbreak.\n\nNow, moral judgment. The author's primary motivation was concern for Jason's well-being and the group's dynamic. They tried to help Jason before, and when their warnings were ignored, they took action when they saw Tessa cheating. While the method of sending the photo might be a bit underhanded, it was done with the intention of preventing further harm. The happiness they felt afterward is a natural reaction to seeing a toxic relationship end, especially after enduring the stress of watching Jason suffer.\n\nHowever, the author did interfere in a personal matter by sending the photo. That could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the author didn't know for sure the guy was the ex. But the context suggests that Tessa was already manipulative and lying, so the author's action might be justified as protecting their friend.\n\nThe celebration part\u2014singing and dancing\u2014might come off as insensitive, but it's also a reaction to the relief of the situation. The author's primary concern was Jason's well-being, and their happiness stems from seeing Jason free from a harmful relationship.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author did what they thought was necessary to help their friend, even if the methods were a bit questionable. The intentions were good. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're not an asshole for feeling happy when a toxic relationship ends, especially after trying to help and seeing the consequences.\n"
