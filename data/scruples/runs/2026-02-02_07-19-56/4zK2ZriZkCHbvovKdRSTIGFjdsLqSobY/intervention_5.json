She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their best friend Jason's relationship with Tessa. The user is the one who's happy the relationship is over, but they're questioning if they're an asshole for feeling that way.\n\nFirst, let's go through the details. The author was friends with Jason before he started dating Tessa. Initially, Tessa was cool, but after they got together, she became very controlling and jealous. She didn't want to hang out with other girls because they might be after Jason, and even avoided friends with girlfriends. The author talked to Jason about this, but he made excuses. Then Tessa started refusing to hang out with the author and tried to get Jason to cut ties. Jason stood up for the author. \n\nLater, the author saw Tessa on a date with a guy, which turned out to be her ex. They sent the picture to Jason, leading to a confrontation. Tessa denied it, but the ex called her out, and she was upset. The author felt bad that Jason was heartbroken but secretly happy that their friend and others got Jason back. The conflict is between feeling bad for Jason and being glad that Tessa is gone.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author's actions: they confronted Jason about Tessa's behavior, which he dismissed. Then, the author took a picture of Tessa with her ex and sent it to Jason, leading to the breakup. The author felt happy about the breakup, which is causing their guilt.\n\nIs the author at fault for being happy? Well, the author was concerned about their friend's well-being and had valid reasons to be worried about the controlling behavior. However, they went ahead and took action by sending the photo, which directly led to the breakup. While the breakup might have been inevitable (since Tessa was cheating), the author's role in exposing it could be seen as crossing a line, especially if they were vindictive. But in this case, the author's intention was to help Jason, even if they secretly were relieved.\n\nThe author's happiness comes from seeing their friend regain independence and the friendship, but the guilt stems from Jason's heartbreak. However, if the relationship was toxic and harmful, the author's happiness might be justified. But the fact that the author took direct action (sending the photo) could be seen as meddling, especially if they knew Jason was planning to propose. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions did end a relationship that was clearly problematic. They had already warned Jason, who didn't listen, so maybe the author felt they had to take matters into their own hands. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified. If they thought they were helping Jason, even if it made them happy, it's a bit of a grey area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling happy, but maybe for intervening without fully considering the consequences, even if the intent was good. However, the question is about being in the wrong for feeling happy, not the act of sending the photo. So if the author's feelings are a natural consequence of the positive outcome, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the happiness is because they wanted to see Jason suffer, then it would be wrong. The story doesn't indicate that; the author felt bad for Jason but was also happy for the friendship's sake. So it's a mix of emotions. The answer depends on whether the happiness is seen as inappropriate. I think the answer is B (author is not in the wrong) because their happiness stems from a positive outcome for their friend, even if they feel guilty. The key is that the author's actions were intended to help, even if the result was mixed.\n"
