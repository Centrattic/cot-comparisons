She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being happy that their best friend Jason's relationship ended due to the girlfriend Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior. The author confronted Jason about Tessa's behavior, which led to Tessa becoming hostile towards them. Later, the author sent Jason a photo of Tessa with her ex, which led to the breakup. Now the author feels conflicted about being happy the relationship ended.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author's actions: they pointed out red flags in Tessa's behavior, which Jason dismissed. When Tessa started isolating Jason from the author, the author had to defend their friendship. Then, when the author saw Tessa with her ex, they sent the photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. The author feels relieved their friend is free from a toxic relationship but also guilty for feeling happy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The main ethical questions here are about the right to intervene in a friend's relationship and the appropriateness of the actions taken. The author did intervene by confronting Jason, which is reasonable if the relationship is harmful. However, sending a photo of Tessa with her ex could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author had good intentions, using evidence to end the relationship might have been a direct cause. \n\nBut then, the author's motivation was to protect their friend from a toxic relationship. Tessa's behavior was controlling, and the author had legitimate concerns. The author's happiness stems from seeing Jason free from a harmful situation, which is a common reaction when someone is relieved a friend is out of a bad relationship. However, the guilt comes from feeling happy about someone else's pain, which is a normal human emotion but might be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe key factors are: the author's intentions were good, the intervention was in response to red flags, and the action taken (sending the photo) directly led to the breakup. Whether that makes them an asshole depends on the balance between the positive outcome (Jason's freedom) and the negative means (exposing the affair). If the author had no other option but to send the photo, maybe it's justified. But if there was a better way to handle it, maybe not. However, the author might have felt cornered and thought this was the only way to help Jason, given that Jason was in denial.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is not in the wrong if their actions were well-intentioned even if they had negative consequences. The author's actions were aimed at protecting a friend from a toxic relationship, which is a valid concern. The guilt the author feels is part of the conflict, which shows they care about Jason's well-being. However, the method of intervention (publicly exposing the affair) could be seen as harsh. But considering Tessa's controlling behavior, maybe the author had to take drastic measures.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the means justified the ends. Since the relationship was clearly toxic, and the author's actions led to Jason being free from it, the author might not be in the wrong. The fact that they felt bad about Jason's heartbreak but also relieved for their friend's sake shows a mix of emotions, which is human. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
