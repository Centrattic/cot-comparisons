She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is friends with Jason. Jason was in a relationship with Tessa, but things went south. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior\u2014being overly jealous, not wanting to hang out with other friends, etc. They told Jason, who made excuses. Then Tessa became distant and tried to cut off the author's friendship with Jason. Later, the author saw Tessa with another guy and sent a picture to Jason, leading to the breakup. Now, the author feels happy the relationship is over but is conflicted about their feelings.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, what are the factors here?\n\n1. **The author's intentions:** They were trying to help Jason by pointing out red flags. That seems reasonable. Friends often do that.\n\n2. **The action of sending the photo:** The author took a picture of Tessa with another guy and sent it to Jason. This might be a privacy issue. However, the context was that there was suspicion of cheating, so maybe they thought it was necessary. But was it right to take the photo and send it without talking to Tessa first?\n\n3. **The aftermath:** Jason confronted Tessa, the relationship ended, and the author felt happy. The author now feels conflicted. Is it wrong to feel happy? People can have mixed emotions\u2014sad for the person they care about but relieved that a toxic situation ended. However, the question is if the author's actions were wrong.\n\n4. **Were the actions justified?** The author tried to warn Jason before, and Tessa's behavior was problematic. If the author's information led to the breakup, but maybe the method (sending the photo) was not the best approach. Maybe a direct conversation between Jason and Tessa would have been better. But the author might not know that Jason had already broken up with Tessa, as per the ex's comment.\n\n5. **Emotional response:** Feeling happy because a friend's toxic relationship ended isn't necessarily wrong. But if the author's actions contributed to the breakup in a manipulative way, that's a problem. However, in this case, the author provided evidence that might have been necessary for Jason to confront the truth.\n\n6. **Is the author an asshole?** If the author's actions were meant to help a friend and the outcome was positive (ending a toxic relationship), even if it caused pain, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if they took it too far by spying or interfering in a way that's not appropriate, that's different.\n\nBut the key points here: the author was trying to help, the relationship was already problematic, and the author's actions led to the truth coming out. The author's happiness might stem from seeing the relationship end because it was harmful. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that they overstepped by sending the photo.\n\nHowever, considering that Tessa was actively pushing Jason away from his friends and the author was trying to support Jason, perhaps the actions were justified. The conflict is between being a supportive friend and the method used. But overall, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
