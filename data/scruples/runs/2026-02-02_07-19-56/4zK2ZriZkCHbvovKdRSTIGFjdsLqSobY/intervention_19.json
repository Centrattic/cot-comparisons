She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a best friend, Jason, whose girlfriend, Tessa, had a controlling and jealous behavior. The author tried to warn Jason, but he didn't listen. Then the author finds out Tessa is cheating with her ex. The author sends a picture to Jason, leading to the breakup. The author feels happy about it but is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here: Tessa was cheating, which is a betrayal. The author provided evidence to Jason, helping him confront the situation. The author did try to warn Jason earlier about Tessa's red flags, which Jason ignored. The author's happiness might stem from seeing a friend get hurt because of cheating, which is understandable. But the question is about being in the wrong.\n\nIs the author at fault for exposing the cheating? If the author had a right to intervene, maybe they weren't wrong. However, the method of sending a picture might be questionable. Also, was the author justified in interfering? The user thinks the author is wrong, but maybe the answer is B. Because Tessa cheated, the author helped Jason see the truth. The author's happiness could be seen as a reaction to justice, not malice. But maybe the author overstepped by sending the photo. Hmm. Alternatively, the author's actions were necessary to help a friend. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help, even if it made them feel happy. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the cheating. If the author acted in good faith to help Jason, then they aren't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
