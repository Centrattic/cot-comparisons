She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is happy that their best friend Jason's relationship with Tessa is over, and they feel conflicted about that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a close friend of Jason. Tessa started acting jealous and controlling after dating Jason. The author warned Jason, who dismissed the red flags. Tessa then tried to cut off the author's friendship with Jason, but Jason stood up for them. Later, the author saw Tessa on a date with her ex and sent a photo to Jason, leading to a confrontation and the breakup. Jason was heartbroken, but the author is secretly happy and even celebrated the breakup.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author was concerned about Jason's relationship and tried to help by pointing out Tessa's behavior. That seems reasonable. When Tessa started cutting the author out, the author might have felt justified in wanting to protect Jason. However, the author took it upon themselves to expose Tessa by sending the photo of her with the ex. This action directly led to Jason confronting Tessa and the breakup. \n\nIs it right to take such a step without considering the consequences? The author might have thought they were helping Jason, but exposing someone's infidelity (or what they believed was infidelity) without proof could be seen as crossing a line. Even if Tessa was indeed cheating, the author's action caused the breakup, and Jason was heartbroken. The author feels happy about that outcome, which adds to the conflict.\n\nBut wait, the author's intention was to help Jason. They were concerned about his well-being. However, the method of sending the photo and causing a public confrontation might have been harsh. Even if Tessa was cheating, the author's role in exposing her led to a very public and hurtful breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that Tessa was abusive and controlling, and the breakup was inevitable. The author's celebration might be seen as a reaction to Tessa's behavior, not just Jason's loss. But the act of sending the photo and the subsequent actions could have been done in a more private and supportive way. \n\nAlso, the author's public celebration of the breakup, like singing \"ding dong the witch is dead,\" might come off as cruel, especially considering Jason's emotional state. While the author might feel justified, it's possible that they hurt Jason by being unempathetic during his time of need.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to take matters into their own hands by sending the photo? Was their celebration inappropriate given Jason's pain? \n\nIn terms of morality, intervening in someone else's relationship can be tricky. Friends can offer support, but taking direct action to end a relationship might be overstepping. The author's actions had real consequences, and while their intention was to help, the method and the reaction afterward could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but it's a close call. However, considering the context of Tessa's controlling behavior, some might argue the author was justified. But the act of sending the photo and the celebration could still be seen as wrong. I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
