She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling happy that their friend's relationship ended. \n\nFirst, the context: The author's best friend Jason was in a relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior early on. They tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed their concerns. Tessa then started isolating Jason and the author. Later, the author found out Tessa was cheating with her ex, which led to the breakup. The author felt glad the relationship ended because they believe Tessa was toxic and that Jason is better off without her. The conflict is whether the author's happiness and celebration of the breakup makes them an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the options A and B. To determine if the author is wrong, we need to assess if their actions or emotions are unjustified. \n\nThe author's main justification is that Tessa's behavior was toxic and harmful. They tried to warn Jason, who didn't listen. The author's happiness stems from seeing Jason get back together with friends and the belief that Jason was being treated poorly. The key point is whether the author's joy is a legitimate reaction to Tessa's negative actions, or if it's inappropriate to feel happy about someone else's misfortune.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, people often feel relieved when a toxic relationship ends, especially if they've seen the negative impact. The author didn't cause the breakup; they merely exposed the infidelity. Tessa's cheating and controlling behavior are on her, and Jason's poor judgment in not addressing it is his own issue. The author's actions in sending the photo might be questionable, but the question is about their feelings afterward. Feeling happy because the relationship ended due to Tessa's flaws could be seen as justified, especially considering the prior red flags the author pointed out.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was happy about the breakup without giving Jason time to process, but the author did express feeling terrible for Jason while also feeling happy. The mixed emotions are complex. The author didn't interfere beyond exposing the cheating, which led to the breakup. Since the author's primary concern was Jason's well-being, their happiness could be seen as a natural reaction to a toxic situation ending. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
