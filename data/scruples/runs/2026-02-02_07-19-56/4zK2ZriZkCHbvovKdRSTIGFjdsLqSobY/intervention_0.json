She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (let's call them the OP) who is a best friend to Jason, who recently went through a breakup with Tessa. The OP was concerned about Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior in the relationship, which they brought up to Jason. Jason didn't take the concerns seriously, and Tessa started to cut the OP out of their interactions. Later, the OP found Tessa on a date with her ex and sent a picture to Jason, leading to the breakup. Now, the OP is conflicted because they feel happy about getting their friend back, even though Jason is heartbroken.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the OP. They were concerned about Jason's well-being and pointed out red flags in Tessa's behavior. However, when Jason didn't act on those warnings, the OP waited until Tessa was cheating and then exposed her. The key points here are whether the OP's actions were justified and if their happiness about the breakup makes them an asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the OP was looking out for Jason's friends and their own friend group, which is understandable. Tessa's behavior was toxic, and the OP might have felt that exposing the infidelity was the right thing to do, especially since Jason was in denial. The OP's actions led to the breakup, which could be seen as necessary for Jason's happiness in the long run, even if it was painful in the short term.\n\nOn the other hand, the OP might have taken it upon themselves to act as a judge in the situation. While Tessa was cheating, the OP's method of sending a photo could be seen as invasive or a private matter that should have been handled by Jason. The OP's subsequent celebration of the breakup might come off as insensitive, even if their intentions were good. Emotionally, it's natural to feel relief when a toxic situation ends, but the OP's reaction might be perceived as lacking empathy for Jason's pain.\n\nThe question is whether the OP's actions crossed a line. If the OP had only shared the information with Jason and let him handle it, that might be more ethical. But the OP took the step further by documenting and sending the photo, possibly escalating the confrontation. Additionally, their reaction of celebrating immediately after Jason's heartbreak could be seen as uncaring, even if they later felt bad.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the OP's primary intention was to help Jason, but their method and reaction might have been inappropriate. They are in a position to care about Jason's well-being, but the way they handled the situation could be considered overstepping. However, the cheating was a clear wrongdoing, and the OP's action led to a necessary breakup. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because while their intentions were good, their actions in exposing the cheating and their insensitive celebration could be seen as crossing the line. However, if the cheating was true, perhaps they were justified. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong. The fact that they took matters into their own hands and then celebrated might make them an asshole. Alternatively, if they were right about Tessa's behavior, maybe they are not. It's a balance between the means and the ends. The answer hinges on whether the method and reaction were appropriate. Given that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Considering the steps taken, maybe the answer is A.\n"
