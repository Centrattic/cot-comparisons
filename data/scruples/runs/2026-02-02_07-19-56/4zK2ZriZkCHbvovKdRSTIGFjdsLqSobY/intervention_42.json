She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their best friend Jason and his ex Tessa. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior, like being jealous and pushing others away. They told Jason, who didn't take it seriously. Later, the author found out Tessa was cheating with her ex, sent a photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. Now the author feels happy that things are back to normal but feels guilty for being glad Jason is heartbroken.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they tried to warn Jason, which is a good friend thing to do. When Jason ignored their advice, they had to confront the situation when Tessa was cheating. Sending the photo was a direct way to stop the cheating, which might be justified. But then, after the breakup, the author is happy Jason is suffering. Is that wrong?\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings of happiness at Jason's misfortune. Even though they care about Jason, they feel more relieved that their friend group is okay. The question is whether it's wrong to feel that way. \n\nIn terms of ethics, taking pleasure in someone else's suffering, even a friend's, could be seen as mean-spirited. However, the author's actions initially were to help Jason. The mixed feelings after the breakup might be natural because they were right about Tessa's issues. But feeling \"backflips\" and singing \"ding dong the witch is dead\" might be excessive, showing schadenfreude, which is generally considered negative.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the author's happiness comes from seeing their friend's relationship end for real reasons, not just because of the breakup itself. Since Tessa was cheating, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for being happy about the end of a toxic relationship. However, the way they feel about Jason's heartbreak is the issue.\n\nI need to consider if the author's happiness is about the cheating or Jason's suffering. If it's about Tessa's cheating, that's justified. But if it's about Jason's pain, that's not. The story says the author felt terrible for Jason but secretly happy. The conflict is between empathy and personal relief. \n\nIn the end, while the initial actions were trying to help, the schadenfreude aspect is problematic. So the author might be in the wrong for feeling that way, even if they had good reasons to dislike Tessa. The answer could be A (they are in the wrong) for their reaction, but maybe not for the actions taken. The question is about being in the wrong for being happy. So the answer is A.\n"
