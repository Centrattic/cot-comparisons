She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their best friend Jason and his ex Tessa. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior, like being overly jealous and controlling, and tried to warn Jason, but he didn't listen. Then later, the author sees Tessa on a date with someone and sends a picture to Jason, which leads to the breakup. The author feels happy about the breakup and even dances celebrating, which makes them question their own actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had valid concerns about Tessa's controlling behavior, which Jason dismissed. By informing Jason about the date, the author might have played a role in the breakup. But was it right to send the picture and cause the confrontation? Maybe there's a line between helping a friend and interfering. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intentions were to help their friend by pointing out red flags. On the other hand, directly confronting the situation by sending the photo could be seen as overstepping, especially since it led to immediate action. The author's happiness at the breakup and mocking Tessa might come off as cruel, even if they had prior issues with her. \n\nAlso, relationships are complex. Even if Tessa was controlling, the author's role in exposing the date might have accelerated the breakup. But Jason might have ended it eventually on his own. The author's celebration could be seen as insensitive to Jason's feelings of heartbreak. However, the author's actions were in response to Tessa's manipulative behavior towards their friendship. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They tried to help and had valid concerns. But their method of intervention might have been harsh, and their reaction (celebrating) could be seen as uncaring. However, given the context of Tessa's behavior and Jason ignoring the red flags, maybe the author's actions were justified. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether the author crossing the line by taking matters into their own hands and mocking Tessa. \n\nHmm, I think the answer hinges on whether the author respecting Jason's autonomy and the natural course of the relationship. Since Jason was already heartbroken but the author's actions might have caused more pain, maybe the author is partially in the wrong. However, considering Tessa's behavior and the author's prior concerns, it's a tough call. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because their intentions were good and Tessa's behavior was problematic. But the way they handled it might have been a bit heavy-handed. So maybe answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
