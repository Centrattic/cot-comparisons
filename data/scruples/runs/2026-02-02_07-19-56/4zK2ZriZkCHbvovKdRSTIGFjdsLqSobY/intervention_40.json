She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is happy their best friend Jason's relationship ended because the girlfriend, Tessa, was causing issues. The author confronted Jason about her behavior, but he defended her. Then the author found out Tessa was cheating and sent a picture to Jason, which led to the breakup. Now the author feels conflicted because they're happy their friend is back but feel bad for being glad Jason is heartbroken.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's actions: they confronted Jason about Tessa's behavior, which Jason dismissed. Then they took a photo of Tessa with another guy and sent it to Jason, which led to the breakup. The author's internal conflict is about feeling glad the relationship is over but also feeling bad for Jason's pain.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was concerned about Tessa's behavior and tried to warn Jason, which is a normal friend reaction. However, when Jason didn't listen, the author took it upon themselves to gather evidence (taking a photo) and sent it to Jason. Is that justified? Maybe, but it could be seen as interfering in a personal relationship. However, in this case, the evidence (the photo) was of Tessa cheating, which is a valid reason for the breakup. The author's motivation might be to help their friend, even if it meant being a bit pushy. \n\nThe author's happiness after the breakup could be seen as insensitive if they didn't consider Jason's feelings. But given that the author had previously warned Jason and the relationship was causing issues with their social circle, maybe their happiness is justified as they wanted the toxic relationship to end. \n\nBut is being happy about someone else's breakup wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions led to the breakup, so they might feel responsible for Jason's pain. However, the cheating was real, so the breakup was inevitable. The author's actions might have hastened the inevitable. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by taking the photo and sending it. Since the photo provided proof of cheating, which Jason might have discovered later, the author might have just accelerated the truth. However, secretly taking the photo could be seen as an invasion of privacy. But given the context, it's a tough call. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author's actions were intended to help a friend, even if it involved some underhanded tactics. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. Since Tessa was cheating, the author's actions might be seen as necessary to expose the deceit. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; they were trying to help a friend out of a toxic relationship, even if their methods were a bit questionable. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
