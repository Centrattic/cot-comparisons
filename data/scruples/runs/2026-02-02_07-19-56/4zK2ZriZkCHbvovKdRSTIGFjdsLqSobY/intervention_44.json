She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend's breakup and the author's reaction. \n\nSo, first, the author's friend Jason was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. The writer noticed Tessa's controlling behavior, like not wanting to hang out with other girls and certain friends. The writer confronted Jason, who made excuses. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and tried to get Jason to cut ties. The author took a picture of Tessa on a date with her ex and sent it to Jason, leading to a breakup. The author felt happy about it, even celebrating, which is making them question if they're an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's actions and their emotional response. The author confronted Jason about Tessa's red flags, which seems reasonable. They didn't push further once Jason was defensive. Then, when they saw Tessa with her ex, they informed Jason. The author might think they were helping by exposing the cheating, but maybe they didn't consider the consequences. \n\nNow, the author's conflict is feeling glad that their friend is back, which is causing them guilt. The question is whether they're in the wrong. If the author acted out of concern and provided information, that's one side. But if they were vindictive or took unnecessary steps, like sending the photo, that could be problematic. \n\nSending the photo might have been a violation of privacy or could have escalated the situation. However, the author's intention was to help Jason realize the infidelity. On the other hand, being happy about the breakup might not be wrong if they thought Tessa was toxic. But friends can have different perspectives. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is nuanced. The author's actions were meant to help, but their celebration could be seen as insensitive. However, if Tessa was indeed abusive or toxic, the author's relief is understandable. But the act of sending the photo without considering the fallout might be the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if their intent was to help, but the method of sending the photo could be questionable. However, the main conflict is about their mixed feelings. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author acted out of concern, even if the celebration was insensitive. But some might say A because of the method used. The key is whether the author's actions were justified. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The sending of the photo was a direct action, but if the author was trying to protect their friend, maybe not. The answer is B.\n"
