She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a best friend of Jason, who was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's behavior changing after they started dating, becoming very jealous and controlling. The author tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa started cutting the author out of their social circle. Eventually, the author caught Tessa on a date with her ex, which led to the breakup. The author felt happy about the breakup because they believe their friend is better off, but they're now conflicted about feeling glad while Jason is heartbroken.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author tried to warn Jason about red flags in Tessa's behavior. That seems like a responsible action, as friends often do when they notice problematic behavior. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence of infidelity until they saw the date. The act of taking a picture and sending it to Jason could be seen as a way to expose the truth, but maybe there was a better way to handle it without being confrontational. However, Jason did confront Tessa and the situation led to the breakup.\n\nThe author's mixed feelings\u2014feeling happy for their friend's return to their social circle versus feeling bad for Jason's pain\u2014is a common emotional conflict. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified. They did try to help Jason before, and when they saw evidence of cheating, they acted. The celebration (\"ding dong the witch is dead\") might be seen as insensitive, but it's also a personal reaction to a situation where they were previously excluded and their friend was being mistreated.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by sending the photo, leading to a public confrontation. But since Tessa was cheating, the author's intention was to help Jason. The guilt the author feels is more about their own happiness conflicting with their empathy for Jason's pain, not necessarily about wrong actions.\n\nSo, considering that the author tried to help, the evidence of cheating was real, and the actions taken led to the truth coming out, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The celebration might be a bit harsh, but it's a personal emotional response. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
