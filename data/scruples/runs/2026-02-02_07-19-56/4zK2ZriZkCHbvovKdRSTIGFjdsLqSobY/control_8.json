She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend Jason, his girlfriend Tessa, and the author's mixed feelings when Tessa's relationship ends.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior when she became jealous and tried to isolate Jason from their friends. The author warned Jason, who dismissed the concerns. Then, Tessa started avoiding the author and tried to cut off their friendship. Later, the author discovered Tessa cheating and sent a photo to Jason, leading to a breakup. The author felt happy about the breakup because they wanted Jason back to their social circle, but they also felt bad for Jason. However, they celebrated the end of the relationship, which is making them question their own actions.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main actions here are: 1) The author voiced their concerns about Tessa's red flags to Jason. 2) When Tessa started excluding the author, Jason didn't let her cut off the friendship. 3) The author took a photo of Tessa with another guy and sent it to Jason, leading to the breakup. 4) The author celebrated the breakup, which is causing guilt.\n\nFirst, when the author brought up Tessa's behavior to Jason, they were trying to help. Even though Jason didn't listen, the author had no control over that. The author's concern was valid because Tessa's behavior was controlling and jealous. So, that part seems justified.\n\nThen, the author took a photo of Tessa with another guy. Wait, but if Tessa was cheating, that's a legitimate reason for Jason to know. However, the ethical question is: was it right to take a picture and send it without confronting Tessa first? Maybe not, but the alternative would be to confront the situation somehow. The author might have thought they were helping by providing evidence. However, this action could be seen as invasive. But since the author saw Tessa out on a date with someone she was supposedly separated from, it's plausible they thought it was necessary to inform Jason.\n\nThe celebration part is where the conflict arises. The author is happy because they miss their friend and the social circle. But feeling happy when someone else is heartbroken could seem insensitive. However, the author had been through Jason's isolation and Tessa's manipulative behavior. The author's happiness might stem from knowing Jason was being harmed, so their relief is understandable. But is feeling relief/joy over someone else's misfortune (even if it's a cheating partner) considered wrong?\n\nThe question is whether the author did something wrong. The actions taken were: warning Jason, which is okay. Then, taking the photo and sending it. The photo itself might be a privacy issue, but the author's intent was to help Jason. However, maybe the method was a bit underhanded. But if Tessa was cheating, the author's action was to protect Jason from being deceived. \n\nIn terms of the celebration, people often feel a mix of emotions when a toxic relationship ends. The author's relief is natural, but they might feel guilty because they don't want to seem happy when Jason is hurting. However, the author also felt terrible for Jason, showing empathy. The key is whether the author's actions were justified. The photo was a means to an end, and the celebration is a personal reaction, not an action directed at others. \n\nIn the end, the author's primary goal was the well-being of their friend and the social group. The actions, while perhaps a bit harsh, were intended to help. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
