She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend Jason has been with Tessa for two years. The author initially thought Tessa was cool, but after they started dating, Tessa became very jealous and controlling. She didn't want to hang out with other friends because of potential other women. The author tried to warn Jason, who made excuses for her. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and tried to get Jason to cut off the author. Jason stood up for his friend, which is good. \n\nThen, the author catches Tessa on a date with another guy. The author sends a photo to Jason, leading to a confrontation. Tessa denies it, but the guy exposes her lies, leading to a breakup. After the breakup, Jason is heartbroken, and the author feels secretly happy that Jason is now back and their social circle is restored. The author dances and sings \"ding dong the witch is dead,\" which is a bit harsh, perhaps indicating glee over a misfortune.\n\nNow, the conflict is whether the author is in the wrong for being happy about the breakup. The author's actions involved informing Jason about the cheating, which is understandable. But the subsequent feelings of glee might be seen as cruel. \n\nBut wait, the author did try to warn Jason earlier about the red flags, which Jason ignored. The author was in a tough spot when Tessa tried to cut them off. The author's actions in this situation were protective of Jason's friendship. \n\nHowever, when Jason was heartbroken, the author's secret happiness and celebration could be seen as insensitive. Even though the relationship was abusive (with Tessa's controlling behavior and cheating), the author's reaction might be considered harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the author did the right thing by confronting the cheating. On the other hand, feeling happy about a friend's heartbreak might be unkind. The key here is the author's emotional response after the breakup. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's happiness is justified. Since the author believed the relationship was harmful and their friend is now free from it, perhaps it's not entirely wrong. But the way they celebrated might be seen as mean. However, the main question is about being in the wrong for feeling happy. In some contexts, taking pleasure in a friend's breakup is wrong, but if the relationship was toxic, it's more understandable. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author tried to help Jason before, and the breakup happened because of Tessa's cheating. The author's happiness is a natural reaction to seeing a friend freed from a bad relationship. Therefore, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a line between being relieved and taking pleasure in someone's suffering. The author crossed that line with the celebration. Wait, but the question is about being happy, not about the celebration. The song choice might be a key point here. \n\nThe phrase \"ding dong the witch is dead\" is a song from The Wizard of Oz where the witch dies, which is a dark and triumphant song. Singing that after a breakup where someone was involved in cheating might be seen as gloating. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they took it too far. However, the core of the question is the happiness itself. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The initial actions were justified, but the reaction after the breakup might be the issue. The author is conflicted between feeling happy and feeling bad. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because they shouldn't have felt happy. If it's B (no), it's because they were right about the toxic relationship and justified in their feelings. \n\nI think the key is that while the author's actions in exposing the cheating were right, the emotional reaction of being happy and celebrating might be inconsiderate. However, in some cases, people feel relief when a toxic relationship ends. The line is between being relieved and being happy. The author might be in the wrong for not showing enough empathy towards Jason's pain. So maybe answer A. But others might say B. Hmm.\n"
