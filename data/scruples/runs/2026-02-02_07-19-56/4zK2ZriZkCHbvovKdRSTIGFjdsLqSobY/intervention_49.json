She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, Jason was in a 2-year relationship with Tessa. The author noticed red flags, like Tessa's jealousy and her cutting off social interactions. The author confronted Jason, but he made excuses. Then Tessa started distancing herself from the author and tried to get Jason to stop seeing them. The author found Tessa on a date with a guy who turned out to be her ex, and the author sent a photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. The author felt bad initially but was secretly happy, even celebrating when Jason was heartbroken.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the actions taken. The author confronted Jason about Tessa's behavior, which seems reasonable as a friend. However, when Jason didn't act on it, the author took matters into their own hands by sending the photo, which could be seen as crossing a line. The author's actions directly led to the breakup, and while they might have had good intentions, they were instrumental in the breakup. The celebration of Jason's suffering, despite him being heartbroken, shows a lack of empathy. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author might feel that they were trying to help Jason by exposing Tessa's deceit. Tessa was cheating, possibly with her ex, so the author might think they were doing the right thing. However, the method of confrontation (sending a photo without discussing it first) and the subsequent celebration could be problematic. \n\nThe key factors are: Did the author have the right to expose Tessa without discussing it with Jason first? The author did send the photo which led to confrontation. Even if Tessa was cheating, the author's role in causing the breakup and then enjoying Jason's pain might make them an asshole. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they took a direct action that led to the breakup without giving Jason a chance to address it himself, and their celebration of Jason's suffering shows a lack of compassion.\n"
