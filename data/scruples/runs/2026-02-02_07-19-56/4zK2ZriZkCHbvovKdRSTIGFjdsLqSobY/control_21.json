She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a best friend to Jason, who was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. The user, who is the author, had concerns about Tessa's behavior\u2014like being overly jealous and isolating Jason from friends. The author tried to warn Jason, but he brushed it off. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and trying to get Jason to cut ties. Later, the author finds out Tessa is cheating with her ex, sends a picture to Jason, which leads to the breakup. The author feels happy about the breakup because they think it's better for the friends, but now feels conflicted about being happy while Jason is heartbroken.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. The key points are: the author had valid concerns about Tessa's behavior, tried to warn Jason, which he dismissed. Then, the author sent a picture of Tessa with another guy to Jason. The author's intention was probably to help Jason see the truth, but the method might be questionable. However, since Tessa was cheating, the author's action might have been justified in exposing the infidelity. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by spying on Tessa and sending the picture without considering how it would affect Jason. \n\nThe author's feelings of happiness after the breakup are natural because the relationship was toxic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for those feelings. The author didn't do anything illegal, but maybe morally, they should have shown more sympathy towards Jason. However, the author was also a victim of Tessa's manipulation. The author's actions were meant to protect the friendship. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author might have had good intentions, sending the photo and then publicly humiliating Tessa could be seen as harsh. But since Tessa was cheating, the author's actions might be seen as helping Jason. The conflict here is between the author's relief that Jason is free from a toxic relationship versus feeling bad for Jason's heartbreak. \n\nIn many cases, people are not wrong for being relieved when a toxic relationship ends, especially if they tried to help the friend beforehand. The author isn't the one who ended the relationship; they provided evidence that led to Jason confronting Tessa. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling happy about the breakup because the relationship had harmful effects on their friend and the friend group. The main issue is whether the method of sending the photo was appropriate, but since the outcome was positive (breaking up with a cheater), the author's actions are more justified. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the author acted to help a friend from a toxic relationship and felt happy about the positive outcome, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
