She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend's relationship ended. Let me go through the story again.\n\nJason and Tessa were in a relationship for two years. The author noticed Tessa's controlling behavior, like not wanting to hang out with other girls because they \"wanted Jason.\" The author warned Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa started cutting off the author and tried to get Jason to stop seeing them. The author caught Tessa on a date with her ex, sent the picture to Jason, leading to the breakup. Now the author feels happy because their friends and they get Jason back, but they feel conflicted about being glad he's heartbroken.\n\nSo, first, the author's actions: they confronted Jason when they saw red flags, which is reasonable. But when Tessa started cutting the author out, maybe the author's sending the photo of Tessa with her ex was a step too far? But the photo was factual. The author might have been trying to help Jason see the truth. However, when the relationship ended, the author's reaction was glee over Jason's heartbreak, which is where the conflict is.\n\nIs it wrong to be happy that a friend's relationship ended, especially if the author believed the partner was toxic? On one hand, the author tried to help Jason before, and maybe the breakup was inevitable. The author's happiness might stem from seeing the friend happy in the long run. On the other hand, empathy for Jason's pain is important. But the question is about the author being an asshole. The author did act in what they thought was Jason's best interest, but their secret happiness about the breakup might be insensitive. However, considering the toxic behavior they witnessed, maybe it's understandable. The key points are that the author tried to warn Jason before, and the breakup led to Jason being heartbroken, but the author's actions were aimed at exposing Tessa's infidelity. The author's actions could be seen as necessary, and their reaction isn't malicious but relieved. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
