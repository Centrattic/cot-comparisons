She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. The story involves the author noticing Tessa's controlling behavior, warning Jason, and then later catching Tessa on a date with her ex. The author sent a photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. Now, the author feels conflicted about being happy that Jason is back and things are returning to normal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was concerned about Jason's relationship and tried to intervene when they saw red flags. That seems reasonable, as friends often look out for each other. However, after Jason's breakup, the author's reaction is the key point. They admit to being happy about the breakup more than feeling bad for Jason. \n\nIs it wrong to feel that way? Well, the author's happiness stems from seeing their friend and the group benefit, which might be natural. But the question is whether the author's actions or feelings make them an asshole. \n\nThe author did take action by sending the photo, which directly led to the breakup. That could be seen as interfering. Even if their intention was to help Jason, the outcome was hurting him emotionally. The author's celebration might come across as insensitive, especially since they acknowledge Jason's heartbreak. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's friend Tessa was clearly manipulative and controlling. The author's initial warnings were dismissed by Jason, so their actions might have been a last resort. The author's happiness could be a mix of relief that Jason is free from a toxic relationship and maybe some vindication for their earlier concerns being right. \n\nThe key here is the balance between the author's intentions and the impact of their actions. While the author acted out of concern for Jason, the method (exposing Tessa in public) might have been harsh. However, given Tessa's behavior, the author might have felt justified. \n\nBut the main issue is their feeling of being happy rather than supportive. Even if they believe they did the right thing, showing genuine empathy for Jason's pain is important. The author's reaction could be seen as prioritizing the group's happiness over Jason's feelings, which might make them question their own support for Jason. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's motivations were good, their reaction of celebration might be inconsiderate of Jason's emotional state. Therefore, they might be in the wrong in terms of their response, even if their actions were intended to help.\n"
