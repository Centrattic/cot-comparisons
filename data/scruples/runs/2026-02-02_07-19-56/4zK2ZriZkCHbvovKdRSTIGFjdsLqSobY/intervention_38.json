She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their best friend Jason's ex, Tessa, and how the author felt happy when the relationship ended. \n\nSo, the key points: The author was concerned about Tessa's controlling behavior, warned Jason, who was in denial. Tessa then started cutting the author off and trying to get Jason to stop seeing them. The author took a picture of Tessa with a guy (her ex) and sent it to Jason, leading to the breakup. Now the author feels conflicted between being glad they're back with friends and feeling bad for Jason.\n\nFirst, the author had a legitimate concern about Tessa's jealousy and controlling actions. Friends often look out for each other, so pointing out red flags isn't inherently wrong. Jason didn't take the advice, which is on him. But then the author took a picture and sent it. Even if Tessa was cheating, is it right to send that picture to Jason as a friend? Maybe not. It's a privacy issue. However, the intention was to help Jason see the truth. \n\nBut after the breakup, the author was happy and even celebrated, which is where the conflict is. Emotionally, it's common to feel relieved when someone who's been a source of stress is gone, especially if that person was toxic. The author's primary loyalty is to their friend, so feeling happy about Tessa's cheating leading to the breakup might be justified. However, the act of sending the picture could be seen as a breach of privacy or being a bit manipulative, even if the intention was good. \n\nBut wait, the author saw Tessa on a date with someone else, which is a significant issue. The restaurant was a known date spot, and the ex confirmed the breakup. So the author's action was to expose Tessa's infidelity, which ultimately led to the breakup. Jason was heartbroken but had plans to propose. The author might have acted out of a place of wanting to protect Jason, even if it's complicated. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They tried to warn Jason when Tessa was being controlling. Then, upon seeing the cheating, they took action. The conflict is in feeling happy about it. But the main question is whether the author did something wrong. Sending the photo could be a point of contention. Maybe it's not the place of a friend to do that? However, the outcome was positive as Tessa was cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by sending the photo. But given Tessa's previous behavior, maybe it was necessary. The celebration part is tricky. If the author was genuinely happy because the toxic relationship ended, maybe that's understandable. But if they were malicious, then yes. The story says the author felt terrible for Jason but secretly was happy. So there's a mix of emotions. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if the author's actions were meant to help Jason despite his denial, it's a gray area. But the act of sending the photo could be seen as interfering too much. However, since Tessa was actually cheating, the author's action was justified. The celebration might be seen as unkind, but if the author was relieved that Jason's suffering ended, maybe not. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the photo-sending was a proper action. If the author had a right to intervene given Tessa's harmful behavior, then maybe not in the wrong. If it was overstepping, then maybe. But given the info, the author was trying to protect Jason, and the breakup was due to Tessa's infidelity. So the author isn't in the wrong because they were helping their friend in a justified situation. Answer B.\n"
