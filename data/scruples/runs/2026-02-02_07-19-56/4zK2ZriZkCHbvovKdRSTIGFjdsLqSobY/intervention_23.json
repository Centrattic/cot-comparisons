She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a best friend to Jason, who was in a relationship with Tessa. The friend noticed that Tessa's behavior changed after she started dating Jason\u2014becoming jealous, isolating Jason from the group, and making excuses for her. The friend tried to warn Jason, but he didn't listen. Then, the friend found Tessa on a date with her ex, sent a picture to Jason, which led to the breakup. Now, the friend feels happy about the breakup because they can have Jason back in their life, but they're conflicted about feeling glad Jason is heartbroken.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the friend's actions: they tried to warn Jason about Tessa's behavior. When Jason didn't listen, they didn't push further, just dropped it. Then, when they saw Tessa with her ex, they sent a picture to Jason. That's a key point. Is that interfering? Maybe, but they had a concern. Jason took action and confronted her, leading to the breakup. The friend feels happy about the outcome but is conflicted about their own happiness over Jason's pain.\n\nIs the friend wrong for being happy? Well, they were concerned about Jason's well-being from the start. Their actions were driven by wanting to protect their friend's relationship and social circle. However, happiness over someone else's heartbreak can be seen as cruel. But maybe in this case, the friend's happiness is because they see the relationship as toxic. The friend didn't force the breakup; they provided information, and Jason made the choice. The friend's secret joy might be a natural reaction to seeing a destructive relationship end. \n\nBut is the friend at fault? They didn't intentionally cause the breakup. They tried to help before, and when they couldn't, they acted on what they saw. The moral question is whether being happy about someone else's pain is wrong. However, the friend's primary concern was for Jason's well-being, not just their own. The fact that Jason was heartbroken is unfortunate, but the friend's actions were aimed at protecting him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the friend isn't in the wrong because their intentions were to help. However, the emotional response of happiness might be seen as insensitive. But the story shows that Tessa was manipulative and the relationship was harmful. The friend's happiness could be justified as relief that Jason is no longer in a bad situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). The friend's actions were aimed at protecting their friend, and their happiness stems from seeing the toxic relationship end, not from malicious intent.\n"
