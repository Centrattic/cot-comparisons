She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for feeling happy that their best friend's relationship ended. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Jason was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's behavior changing after they got together, becoming jealous and exclusionary. The author tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed the concerns. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and tried to get Jason to cut ties. The author then saw Tessa on a date with her ex and confronted Jason. The relationship ended messily, and the author feels happy because they get Jason back, even though Jason is heartbroken.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's actions and emotions. The author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's red flags, which could be seen as caring. However, the author also took a picture of Tessa with her ex and sent it to Jason, which might have escalated the situation. The author's secret happiness about the breakup could be seen as insensitive, but maybe justified if Tessa was toxic.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to protect Jason, but the method of confronting him with the photo might have been harsh. On the other hand, Jason was in a harmful relationship, and the author's actions might have led to his realization. The author's mixed emotions are natural; they care about Jason but also felt wronged by Tessa's behavior.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling happy? Well, people often feel relieved when a toxic relationship ends, especially if they were affected by it. The author's actions were aimed at helping Jason, even if the outcome was painful. However, the act of sending the photo without talking to Tessa first could be problematic. But given the context, the author's primary motivation was concern for Jason's well-being. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No), because the author had valid reasons to feel that way, given Tessa's behavior and the impact on Jason and their friendship. The author's happiness stems from seeing their friend recover and the toxic relationship end.\n"
