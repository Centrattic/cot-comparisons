She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend Jason and his girlfriend Tessa.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author, let's call them the narrator, is a best friend to Jason. Tessa, Jason's girlfriend, started acting jealous and controlling after they started dating. The narrator tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa started avoiding the narrator and wanted Jason to cut ties. The narrator later caught Tessa on a date with her ex, sent a picture to Jason, leading to a breakup. The narrator feels happy about it, dances around, and now feels conflicted.\n\nSo the question is, is the narrator in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The narrator's actions: they tried to warn Jason about Tessa's behavior, which they saw as red flags. When Jason ignored them, they eventually saw Tessa cheating and exposed it. Now they're feeling happy instead of sad.\n\nPossible angles: Did the narrator overstep by sending the photo? Was it their place to intervene? Were their actions justified given Tessa's behavior? Also, the narrator's happiness could be seen as cruel, but maybe they were justified if the relationship was toxic.\n\nTessa's actions were controlling, isolating Jason from friends, and then cheating. The narrator tried to support Jason. When Jason ignored the warnings, maybe the narrator felt vindicated when the relationship ended. Their reaction, while perhaps not kind, might stem from relief that Jason is free from a toxic relationship.\n\nBut was the act of sending the photo a good idea? If the narrator didn't have Tessa's consent and it led to a public confrontation, maybe that's where they went wrong. However, if they were trying to protect Jason from being cheated on, their intention was good. The conflict here is between loyalty to the friend and privacy concerns, but the outcome was the end of a harmful relationship.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the narrator's happiness might be seen as cold, but considering the betrayal and control Tessa exerted, the narrator might feel justified. The key is whether their actions were in good faith to help Jason, which they were. The aftermath of the breakup and Jason's heartbreak are unfortunate, but the narrator's role was to support Jason, which they did.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the narrator is not in the wrong). They were trying to help their friend and exposed the infidelity, which led to the end of a toxic relationship. Their happiness comes from seeing the toxic person gone and their friend getting back some of his social freedom. The actions, while maybe not the most diplomatic, were in good faith.\n"
