She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, Jason was in a relationship with Tessa for two years. The author noticed red flags like Tessa being overly jealous and controlling. They told Jason, but he made excuses. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and trying to get Jason to cut off the author. The author took a picture of Tessa on a date with someone else and sent it to Jason. It turned out to be her ex, and the situation escalated into a breakup. The author felt glad that Jason was heartbroken but happy that their friend group is back to normal. They even celebrated by dancing and singing.\n\nThe key points here are: the author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's behavior, which was toxic. When Jason ignored the warnings, Tessa became hostile towards the author. The author's actions led to the breakup, but their main motivation was concern for Jason's well-being. However, the author is conflicted because they feel relieved more than empathetic towards Jason's pain.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the author did what they thought was right by confronting Jason and trying to protect him from a toxic relationship. The relationship had issues, and the author's actions might have helped end it. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by taking photos and sending them, which could be seen as invading privacy or meddling. However, the situation escalated on its own when the person turned out to be the ex, so maybe the author's role was minimal in causing the breakup.\n\nThe author felt happy about the breakup because they saw the relationship as harmful. But being happy about a friend's pain could be seen as insensitive. However, the author's intention was to help Jason, so maybe their feelings are natural given the toxic environment. The key is whether the actions were justified. Since Tessa was controlling and manipulative, and Jason was in denial, the author's actions might be seen as necessary. However, the method of sending a photo without confrontation could be problematic. \n\nBut considering the overall context\u2014Tessa was abusive, and the author had tried to warn Jason\u2014their happiness might stem from seeing Jason finally free from a toxic relationship. So they might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author's actions directly caused harm, but in this case, the breakup was due to Tessa's own actions (cheating or lying). So the author isn't to blame. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. Maybe the author crossed a line by taking a photo and sending it. However, the situation turned out to be a misunderstanding with the ex. So maybe the author's role was small. So, the answer is B.\n"
