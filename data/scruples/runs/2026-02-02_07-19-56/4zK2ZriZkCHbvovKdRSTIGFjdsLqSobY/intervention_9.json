She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. The story goes like this: Jason's girlfriend Tessa started acting jealous and controlling after a while. The author warned Jason, who dismissed the behavior. Tessa then avoided the author and tried to get Jason to cut off contact. Then the author saw Tessa on a date with someone else, sent the photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. The author felt glad because their friends got Jason back, even though Jason was heartbroken. Now they're conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was concerned about Jason's well-being and tried to help. But when Jason ignored the advice, the author took action by exposing the cheating. That action led to the breakup. The author's happiness seems to stem from seeing their friend's social circle restored and the toxic relationship ending. But is being happy about someone else's breakup wrong?\n\nWell, the author's intentions were to help Jason. However, their reaction of glee when Jason was hurting might come off as insensitive. Even if the relationship was toxic, Jason is still hurting, and the author's happiness could be seen as lacking empathy. But maybe it's natural to feel relieved when a friend is freed from a bad relationship. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author overstep by taking the photo and sending it? That could have been a direct cause of the breakup. But the user's question is about feeling happy, not the action itself. The key point is the author's emotional response. \n\nIn some contexts, being happy about a breakup could be seen as wrong if it shows a lack of support for the ex. But in this case, the author supported Jason by warning him. However, their public celebration might not be appropriate when Jason is still suffering. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be in the wrong for feeling happy, but perhaps their expression of that happiness was unkind. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the author's feelings aren't inherently wrong, but maybe their reaction was. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the action (taking a photo and sending it) is considered, maybe the author did something wrong there. But the user's focus is on the emotional response after the breakup. \n\nHmm. The main issue is the author's happiness. If the author's actions led directly to the breakup, then maybe they have mixed feelings. But the user's conflict is between being glad for the friends and feeling bad for Jason. The author's feelings aren't inherently wrong. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that they should be more empathetic towards Jason's pain. \n\nAlternatively, if the author's happiness is seen as callous, then A (in the wrong). But in relationships, people have varying reactions. Since the author had a good intent and the relationship was toxic, maybe it's B. However, the celebration (\"ding dong the witch is dead!\") might be crossing a line. So maybe A. But I'm a bit torn. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the actions were justified, then their feelings are okay. But if the way they expressed it was wrong, maybe A. But the question is about being in the wrong for feeling happy. \n\nIn the end, maybe the answer is B, as feelings aren't inherently wrong, even if the expression might be. So the author isn't in the wrong for feeling happy, though they could handle it more sensitively. So B.\n"
