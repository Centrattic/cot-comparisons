She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The person is happy that their friend's relationship ended because the girlfriend was being controlling and the friend was being manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author, let's call them the narrator, was friends with Jason and his girlfriend Tessa. Initially, Tessa was cool, but after dating Jason, she became jealous and controlling. The narrator tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed it. Tessa then started avoiding the narrator and trying to get Jason to cut off the friendship. The narrator caught Tessa on a date with her ex, and after a confrontation, the relationship ended. The narrator feels happy because their friend is heartbroken but the manipulative relationship is over. They feel conflicted about being happy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. The key points here are the narrator's actions. They tried to inform Jason about Tessa's red flags, which is a responsible action. When Jason ignored the warnings, the narrator had to deal with Tessa's hostility. Then, when the narrator saw Tessa with her ex, they sent a picture to Jason, which led to the breakup. The narrator's happiness stems from the fact that Jason is now free from a toxic relationship.\n\nIs the narrator wrong for feeling happy? Well, the narrator's intentions were to protect their friend. The actions taken (sending the photo) were to expose the cheating, which was a valid reason. Feeling relieved or happy that a toxic relationship ended isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the person in the relationship was being harmed. However, the method of sending the photo could be questioned. Did the narrator have the right to intervene that way? Maybe they should have let Jason find out on his own, but the situation was already tense, and Tessa was manipulative. The narrator might have felt that direct action was needed.\n\nThe conflict here is between the narrator's loyalty to Jason and their judgment about Tessa's behavior. The narrator's actions were in Jason's best interest, even if it caused immediate pain. Emotional support friends often step in when they see someone being mistreated. Feeling happy when a toxic situation ends is a natural reaction, especially if it means the friend can recover.\n\nSo, considering all that, the narrator isn't in the wrong. They tried to help their friend, and their happiness comes from seeing their friend freed from a harmful relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
