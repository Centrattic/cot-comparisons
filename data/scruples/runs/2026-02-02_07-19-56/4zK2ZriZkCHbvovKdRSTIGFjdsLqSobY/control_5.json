She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their best friend Jason was in a relationship with Tessa, who became very jealous and controlling. The author warned Jason about her behavior, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa started cutting off the author and pushing Jason away. Later, the author saw Tessa on a date with another guy (her ex) and sent a picture to Jason, leading to the breakup. The author feels happy the relationship ended but is conflicted about their own feelings.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The author had legitimate concerns about Tessa's behavior, which were ignored by Jason. They confronted him, but he didn't take it seriously. When the author saw Tessa with someone else, they acted on it by sending the photo. The breakup happened, and the author feels relief rather than sympathy for Jason. Now, they're questioning if they're an asshole for feeling that way.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They tried to help Jason by pointing out red flags. That's not wrong. Then, when they saw Tessa with another guy, they informed Jason. That's also reasonable because cheating would be a valid reason for the breakup. The author's happiness stems from the fact that Jason's toxic relationship ended, allowing their friendship to return. It's natural to feel relieved when a friend is in a bad situation and it gets resolved, especially when they were in denial.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they acted out of malice or if they had no right to intervene. But in this case, they were concerned about their friend's well-being. The act of sending the photo was to expose infidelity, which is a justified action. The author's feelings of happiness are a result of seeing Jason freed from a harmful relationship. It's possible that the author isn't an asshole but rather someone who cares about their friend's welfare and is glad the toxic situation ended.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have trusted Jason to handle his own relationship. But since Jason was being manipulated and the author tried to help, it's understandable. The conflict here is between the author's relief and Jason's heartbreak. But the author's intentions were good, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
