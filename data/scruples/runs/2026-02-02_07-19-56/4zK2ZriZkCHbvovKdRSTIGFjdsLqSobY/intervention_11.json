She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being happy about their friend's broken relationship. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author, let's call them the questioner, had a friend named Jason who was in a relationship with Tessa. The questioner noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior early on, like not wanting to hang out with other girls or friends who had boyfriends. They tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa started avoiding the questioner and tried to cut them off from Jason. Jason stood up for the questioner, which is good.\n\nLater, the questioner saw Tessa on a date with someone else and sent a picture to Jason. It turns out she was cheating with her ex, who claimed they were told Jason had broken up with her. The breakup happened, and Tessa blamed the questioner. After packing up Tessa's stuff, Jason was heartbroken, but the questioner felt secretly happy because they got their friend back. They even celebrated by singing \"ding dong the witch is dead.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for feeling happy. The user thinks they are in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nOn one hand, the questioner was concerned about Jason's well-being and tried to help, which is understandable. Tessa's behavior was clearly problematic, and the cheating confirms that. The questioner's actions (sending the photo) led to the breakup, which might have been necessary. But the celebration part is where it's tricky. Feeling happy that your friend is hurt might seem cold, but the questioner's happiness comes from their friend getting back someone who was abusive.\n\nBut wait, did the questioner have the right to intervene? They sent the photo, which might have been the catalyst for the breakup. Even though Tessa was cheating, the questioner's actions could have been harsh. However, given the red flags they observed, it might be justifiable. The real issue is their reaction. The questioner admits to being glad Jason went through horrible things, but more so about getting their friend back. The celebration seems to mock Tessa, which might be unkind, but the questioner's motive was to protect their friend.\n\nIs it wrong to be happy when someone you care about is free from an abusive relationship? The questioner's happiness is tied to their friend's well-being, which is a valid reason. However, the way they celebrated might come off as insensitive. But given the context, maybe it's forgivable.\n\nAlso, the questioner tried to warn Jason, and when that didn't work, took action when they saw the cheating. They didn't plan to ruin the relationship but wanted to expose the infidelity. The happiness stems from a friend getting out of a bad situation, not from Tessa's suffering. So maybe they're not in the wrong. But it's complicated because they did play a role in the breakup, even if it was justified.\n\nI think the key is whether the happiness is from seeing Tessa get what she deserves, which would be wrong, or from Jason being free. The questioner mentions feeling more glad about getting friends back than sad for Jason. That part is concerning because it's more about their gain than Jason's loss. But maybe that's natural after seeing someone in a toxic relationship. The answer could be that they're not in the wrong because they were acting out of concern for Jason's well-being, even if their reaction was a bit over the top. So, Answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
