She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (let's call them the person in question) being happy that their best friend Jason's relationship with Tessa ended. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. Jason and Tessa were in a 2-year relationship. Tessa became possessive and controlling, not wanting to hang out with other girls or friends who had girlfriends, which the person in question found problematic. They tried to warn Jason, but he made excuses. Then Tessa started cutting the person out and trying to get Jason to stop seeing them. Jason resisted and kept the friendship.\n\nRecently, the person saw Tessa on a date with her ex and sent a picture to Jason. Jason confronted them, and it turned out Tessa was lying about the relationship status. She was cheating, and the person felt happy about it because they thought Tessa was bad for Jason. Now, they are conflicted about being glad the relationship ended and feeling guilty for being happy.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. \n\nI need to determine if the author's feelings are justified. The key here is whether the author's actions and emotions were appropriate. \n\nThe person did try to warn Jason before, which was the right thing to do as a friend. They sent the picture to Jason when they saw Tessa cheating, which could be seen as helping him uncover the infidelity. However, the act of taking a picture and sending it without confronting Tessa first might be a bit of an invasion of privacy or a breach of trust if they didn't have a right to do so. \n\nBut Jason already had a long history of being in denial about Tessa's controlling behavior. The person did their part to warn him, and when Tessa started cutting them out, they might have felt justified in taking action. The confrontation led to the breakup, and the person felt relieved because Jason was finally free from a toxic relationship. \n\nFeeling happy when a friend's toxic relationship ends isn't necessarily wrong. Friends often support each other from breaking up with someone who's causing harm. The person's actions were meant to help Jason, even if they were a bit direct. However, the way they reacted after the breakup with the \"ding dong the witch is dead\" song might come off as harsh or insensitive. \n\nBut considering that Tessa was manipulative and the relationship was clearly unhealthy, the person's happiness could be seen as a natural response to seeing their friend in a bad situation end. The author might not be the asshole here because they were concerned about Jason's well-being and took action to protect their friend. \n\nStill, there's a line between being glad the relationship ended and reveling in the breakup. The person should have been supportive of Jason's emotional state during the breakup, even if they were relieved. But since Jason was the one who ended it after the confrontation, the person's role was to help him see the truth. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their friend and the breakup was a result of Tessa's dishonesty and controlling behavior. Feeling happy about it is human nature, especially when the relationship was harmful.\n"
