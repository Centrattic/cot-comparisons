She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author, let's call them Alex, is a close friend of Jason. Jason was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. Alex noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior after they started dating. Alex tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed the concerns. Then Tessa started cutting Alex out of their interactions, which Jason resisted. \n\nLater, Alex sees Tessa on a date with someone else and sends a picture to Jason, leading to the breakup. Jason is heartbroken, but Alex feels relieved and even celebrates. The question is whether Alex is an asshole (ITA) for feeling that way.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did Alex overstep by sending the photo? Was their happiness justified? \n\nAlex's intentions might have been to help Jason, but the method was a bit direct. However, seeing Tessa with another guy is a clear sign of infidelity, so exposing that could be seen as protecting Jason. On the other hand, sending the photo might have been a harsh way to confront her, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. \n\nAlex's celebration feels a bit harsh because even if Tessa was toxic, Jason was genuinely hurt. But Alex also had to deal with Tessa's exclusion and the stress of watching their friend suffer. The conflict is between empathy for Jason and relief that the toxic relationship ended. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the question is about being happy about someone's misfortune. However, in this case, it's not just any misfortune\u2014it's the end of a harmful relationship. So, while it's natural to feel relief, the celebration might come off as insensitive. But considering the context, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe answer might depend on how one weighs the malicious intent. If Alex's actions were to help Jason, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But the celebration part could make them look like they wanted the breakup, which complicates things. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because the root of Alex's actions was concern for Jason's well-being, even if the celebration was a bit over the top. People can have mixed emotions here. So, probably B.\n"
