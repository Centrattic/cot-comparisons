She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Jason was in a relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior, like not wanting to hang out with other girls or friends who have girlfriends. The author warned Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa started cutting the author out, but Jason stood by them. \n\nLater, the author saw Tessa on a date with her ex and sent a picture to Jason. It turns out Tessa was lying about the breakup and cheating. The relationship ended, and the author felt happy because they saw Tessa as toxic. The author is now conflicted between feeling relieved for Jason's return to their friend group and feeling bad for Jason's heartbreak.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's actions. They confronted Jason about Tessa's behavior, which seems responsible. When Tessa excluded them, the author didn't push further, which might be prudent. Catching Tessa cheating and informing Jason was a direct action to help Jason. The author's happiness stems from the belief that Tessa was bad for Jason and the friend group. \n\nHowever, the author sent a picture that led to a confrontation, which might have contributed to the breakup. But since Tessa was cheating, maybe the author's action was justified. The author's secret happiness could be seen as insensitivity to Jason's feelings, but if they thought they were protecting Jason from a toxic relationship, it's more about concern. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their intentions were to help Jason and their friends. They tried to warn him, and when Tessa cheated, exposing it was right. Feeling relieved after a toxic relationship ends isn't being an asshole. So answer B.\n"
