She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for being happy their best friend's relationship ended. The situation is that Jason's girlfriend Tessa became controlling and jealous, cutting off friends. The author warned Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa tried to get Jason to stop seeing the author. Later, the author sees Tessa on a date with her ex and sends a picture to Jason, which leads to the breakup. The author feels relieved and even celebrates, but is conflicted.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. First, Tessa's behavior was abusive\u2014jealousy, cutting off friends, controlling social interactions. The author tried to warn Jason, who didn't listen. The author's actions (sending the photo) led to the breakup. But is it wrong to be happy about it?\n\nThe author's primary motivation was concern for Jason and their friends. They tried to support Jason by pointing out red flags. When Tessa's actions became more hostile towards them, it's understandable to feel vindicated when the relationship ends. The celebration might be seen as insensitive, but given the context of Tessa's behavior, it's also a reaction to regaining Jason's friendship and seeing him free from a toxic relationship.\n\nHowever, the author did send a photo to expose the infidelity, which could be considered an invasion of privacy. But the ex was Tessa's own ex, so maybe the guy had a right to confront her. The author's role was more of a witness, and the photo was evidence of Tessa's lies. Jason handled the confrontation, not the author.\n\nThe conflict is between empathy for Jason's heartbreak and the relief of friends getting their friend back. The author's happiness might seem harsh, but given the toxic relationship, it's a complex mix of emotions. The key is whether the author acted unethically. They tried to warn Jason, didn't force the breakup, and the breakup happened due to Tessa's own actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
