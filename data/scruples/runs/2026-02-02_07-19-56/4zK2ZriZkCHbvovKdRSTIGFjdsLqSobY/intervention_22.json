She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend Jason's relationship with Tessa. The author was concerned about Tessa's jealous behavior and warned Jason, but he dismissed their concerns. Then, when the author saw Tessa with another guy, they sent a photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. Now, the author is happy about the breakup but feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to help their friend by pointing out Tessa's red flags. They did confront Jason, who didn't take it seriously. When the author saw Tessa with another guy, they acted by sending the photo. However, this action directly led to Tessa's confrontation and the breakup. The author's happiness stems from their friend getting back together with their friends and the toxic relationship ending.\n\nBut here's the catch: Did the author have the right to intervene in that way? Sending the photo might have been a violation of Tessa's privacy and could have caused unnecessary harm. Even if the author believed they were right, their actions had real consequences. Jason was heartbroken, and Tessa was publicly humiliated, which the author might have contributed to. The author's secret happiness could be seen as cruel, especially since they felt bad for Jason but still celebrated his pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern was genuine. They were trying to protect their friend from a toxic relationship. However, the method they used (sending the photo) was problematic. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Even if Tessa was in the wrong, the author's actions might have crossed a line. The guilt the author feels is important because it shows they recognize the potential wrongness of their actions.\n\nThe key here is the balance between helping a friend and respecting others' boundaries. The author's happiness might be justified if Tessa was truly toxic, but their method of intervention could be considered inconsiderate. So, the answer could hinge on whether the author's actions were necessary and respectful. Since the author took a direct and potentially invasive step, they might be in the wrong.\n"
