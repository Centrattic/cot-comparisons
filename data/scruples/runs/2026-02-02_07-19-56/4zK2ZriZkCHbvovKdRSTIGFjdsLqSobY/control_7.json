She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for being happy that their friend's relationship ended. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's best friend, Jason, was in a two-year relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's behavior becoming controlling and jealous, like not wanting to hang out with other girls or friends who have girlfriends. The author tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed it. Then Tessa started avoiding the author and tried to get Jason to cut off contact. \n\nLater, the author saw Tessa on a date with someone else, sent a picture to Jason, leading to a confrontation. It turned out she was with her ex, and Tessa lied about it. The relationship ended, Jason was heartbroken, but the author felt relieved and happy, even celebrating. Now, they're conflicted about feeling glad instead of sympathetic.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is an asshole for feeling happy. \n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author was concerned about Jason's well-being and tried to help. Tessa's behavior was definitely red flags\u2014jealousy, controlling, cutting off friends. The author's actions might have prompted the breakup, but they were motivated by wanting to protect their friend. However, the author's celebration might seem insensitive, especially since Jason was heartbroken. \n\nBut also, the author's happiness comes from seeing their friend return to them and Tessa's deceit being exposed. The author might not be wrong if they felt Tessa's actions were harmful. However, the public celebration right after the breakup could be seen as cruel, even if their intentions were good. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had valid reasons to be concerned about Jason's relationship. They stood by him, and the breakup might have been inevitable. The author's feelings are a mix of relief and happiness, which is natural given the circumstances. \n\nI think the key is whether the author's actions and feelings were malicious. They sent the photo to Jason, which was a direct action to expose Tessa's infidelity. But the celebration might have been unkind, even if their overall intentions were good. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were acting in their friend's best interest, even if their reaction was a bit over-the-top. People have different thresholds for what's appropriate in such situations. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's happiness is justified given Tessa's behavior and their efforts to help Jason. If the author's actions were intended to help and they weren't just vindictive, then they might not be in the wrong. However, the celebration could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nBut given the context of Tessa's controlling behavior and deceit, the author's reaction might be understandable. They were probably tired of Tessa's toxicity and relieved that Jason isn't with someone who lied to him. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author had valid reasons to be concerned and their actions were aimed at protecting their friend, even if their reaction was a bit unkind. The primary motivation was Jason's well-being, not malice towards Tessa. So, they're not an asshole.\n"
