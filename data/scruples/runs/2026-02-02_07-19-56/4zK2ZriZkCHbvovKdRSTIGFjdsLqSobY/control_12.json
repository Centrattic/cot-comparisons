She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being happy that their best friend's relationship ended. The situation involves a friend named Jason and his girlfriend Tessa. The author tried to warn Jason about Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior, but Jason didn't listen. Then Tessa started cutting the author and others out. Later, the author found out that Tessa was cheating with her ex, so they sent a picture to Jason. The breakup happened, and the author felt relieved, even dancing and singing. Now they're conflicted about whether they're an asshole.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the author tried to help Jason before, which Jason dismissed. Then Tessa's cheating led to the breakup. The author feels happy because Jason is back to being part of their friend group, but guilty about not feeling bad enough for Jason.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were wrong. They did what any concerned friend would do\u2014point out Tessa's red flags. Jason ignored the advice, and the author couldn't force him to make a decision. When they found out about the cheating, sending the picture was a way to intervene again. The author's reaction of being happy might be seen as cruel, but maybe it's justified because Tessa was toxic. \n\nBut wait, even if Tessa was bad, the author's joy at Jason's suffering could be problematic. However, the author might be more relieved that the toxic situation is over. Also, Jason was in denial initially, so maybe the author's happiness isn't entirely wrong. The answer depends on whether being happy about the breakup, given the circumstances, is asshole behavior. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to help and the relationship was harmful. Their happiness comes from seeing their friend free from a bad relationship. The answer should be B (No). But maybe there's a nuance. The author's reaction might be a bit harsh, but considering the context, it's understandable. So I'll go with B.\n"
