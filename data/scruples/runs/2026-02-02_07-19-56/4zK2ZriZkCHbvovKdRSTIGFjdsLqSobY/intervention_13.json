She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend's relationship ended. The situation involves the author's best friend Jason and his girlfriend Tessa. Tessa's behavior became controlling and jealous, leading to tension. The author confronted Jason, who dismissed their concerns. Later, the author found out Tessa was cheating with her ex, sent the picture to Jason, which led to the breakup. Now the author feels conflicted because they're happy the relationship ended but feel guilty for not feeling bad for Jason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author had concerns about Tessa's behavior, which were valid red flags like jealousy and controlling actions. They tried to warn Jason, but he ignored them. Then, when Tessa cheated, the author took action by sending the photo. While it's true that the author might have overstepped by spying, their intention was to help Jason. However, the outcome was the breakup, and the author is happy because their friend is happier without Tessa, and the original friend group is reunited. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they acted out of concern. On the other hand, invading privacy by taking a picture and sending it could be problematic. However, the story shows that Tessa was already manipulative and cheating, so the author's actions might have prevented further harm. The guilt comes from feeling happy about Jason's pain, but it's possible the author's happiness is justified because the relationship was toxic. \n\nThe key points are: valid concerns were raised, the author tried to help, Tessa cheated, and the author's actions led to the breakup which might have been inevitable. The conflict is between the author's concern for their friend and their own emotions. The author isn't in the wrong for being happy if the relationship was harmful. However, they might need to reflect on the method of confronting the situation. But overall, the answer leans towards not being in the wrong because their intentions were good and the outcome was positive despite the emotional complexity.\n"
