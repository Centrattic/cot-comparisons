She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The question is whether sending a picture of Tessa on a date to Jason, leading to their breakup, makes the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author was concerned about Tessa's behavior from the start. They mentioned her becoming jealous and controlling, which they pointed out to Jason. Jason dismissed their concerns. Then, when the author saw Tessa with another guy, they sent a photo to Jason, which resulted in a confrontation. The author feels happy the relationship ended because it brought Jason back to their friends, but they're conflicted about their own feelings.\n\nNow, considering the actions: The author's intention was to protect their friend from what they believed was an unhealthy relationship. They had already warned Jason before, and when he didn't take action, they took it upon themselves to provide evidence of Tessa's infidelity. However, using a photo to confront Jason might have been a direct approach, but was it justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author acted out of concern for Jason's well-being, which is understandable. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by not considering Jason's right to handle the situation himself. The author's happiness at the breakup and the public shaming with the \"ding dong the witch is dead\" moment could be seen as cruel, especially when Jason was heartbroken.\n\nBut the author's actions were based on prior observations and attempts to help. The key points are whether the author had the right to intervene so directly and if their reaction was proportionate. While their concern was genuine, the method of intervention might have been heavy-handed, and their celebration could be seen as insensitive. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. In the AITA context, being an asshole often involves malicious intent or causing harm unnecessarily. Here, the author's actions were meant to help, even if they crossed a line. The answer might hinge on whether their approach was respectful and appropriate, but given the context, it's a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for critique.\n"
