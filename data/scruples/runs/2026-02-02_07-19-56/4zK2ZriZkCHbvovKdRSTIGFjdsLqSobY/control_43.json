She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend Jason's relationship ended. The situation is pretty detailed. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is close friends with Jason. Jason's girlfriend Tessa changed her behavior after they started dating, becoming very jealous and controlling. The author warned Jason about her red flags, but Jason dismissed them. Tessa then started avoiding the author and trying to get Jason to cut ties. Later, the author saw Tessa on a date with another guy and sent a picture to Jason. It turned out she was with her ex, and the relationship ended. The author feels conflicted because they're happy Jason is free again but feel bad for him.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for being happy about the breakup. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's actions need to be evaluated. Did they do something wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author was concerned about Tessa's behavior and tried to help Jason see the red flags. That seems reasonable. Then, when Jason didn't take the advice, the author couldn't do much else, so they dropped it. So far, not in the wrong.\n\nThen, when the author saw Tessa with another guy, they sent a picture to Jason. That led to the breakup. The author's intention here might be debated. However, if they truly believed Tessa was cheating, forwarding the photo was an attempt to help Jason. But maybe the author shouldn't have taken that action, depending on context.\n\nHowever, the main issue is the author's feelings of happiness after the breakup. Are they in the wrong for feeling that way? The user is conflicted between feeling glad for their friend's return and feeling bad for Jason. \n\nIn terms of morality, being happy that someone else's relationship ends, especially if it was harmful, might not be considered wrong. The author had valid concerns about Tessa's controlling behavior and the toxic environment she created. The author's actions were motivated by concern for Jason and their circle of friends. \n\nBut, did the author have the right to interfere? Sending the photo could be seen as crossing a boundary if the author wasn't certain about the situation. However, in this case, Tessa was with her ex, and the ex called her out, so maybe the author's action was justified. \n\nThe key point is the author's emotional response. Feeling relieved or happy when a toxic situation ends isn't inherently wrong. The author's primary concern was for their friend's well-being, and the relationship was likely causing Jason and others distress. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling happy about the breakup. Their actions were in response to a toxic situation, and their feelings are a natural reaction to seeing a friend hurt. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
