She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves their best friend Jason, his girlfriend Tessa, and the author's reactions to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was concerned about Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior, which they pointed out to Jason. Jason dismissed the author's concerns. Later, the author discovered Tessa cheating and sent a photo to Jason, leading to the breakup. The author feels conflicted about their happiness over the breakup versus feeling bad for Jason.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the actions step by step. The author initially warned Jason about Tessa's red flags. Jason didn't take the author's concerns seriously. Then, when the author saw Tessa with another guy, they sent a photo to Jason. Jason confronted her, and the relationship ended. The author admits to feeling happy about the breakup and acting out in celebration, which made them feel conflicted.\n\nIs sending the photo to Jason unethical? Well, the author saw Tessa cheating, so informing Jason is a natural response. However, did they have the right to send a photo? Maybe, but it's a personal judgment. The author's main issue is feeling glad the relationship ended and not feeling guilty. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether their actions crossed a line. They didn't encourage the breakup directly; they just informed Jason of what they saw. The author's happiness stems from their friend's happiness being restored. However, the author is conflicted because they feel bad for Jason's pain but also relieved that the toxic relationship ended. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and actions. The author's intent was to help Jason by exposing Tessa's infidelity. The celebration after the breakup, while unkind, might be seen as justified if the author believed the relationship was harmful. However, taking pleasure in someone's misfortune, even if it's for a just cause, can be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut considering the context, the author was a friend who had previously tried to warn Jason, and Tessa's behavior was toxic. The author's actions led to the truth coming out, which Jason needed to hear. The celebration might be a bit excessive, but the main issue is whether the author is responsible for Tessa's actions. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their actions were based on genuine concerns and the truth. However, the celebration might be a separate issue. But the question is about being in the wrong overall. Since the author acted in what they believed was their friend's best interest, and the relationship was indeed harmful, their actions are justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (no).\n"
