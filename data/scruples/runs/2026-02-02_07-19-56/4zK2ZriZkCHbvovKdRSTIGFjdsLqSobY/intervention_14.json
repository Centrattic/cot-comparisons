She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being happy that their friend's relationship ended. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Jason was in a relationship with Tessa. The author noticed Tessa's controlling and jealous behavior early on. They tried to warn Jason, but he dismissed their concerns. Then Tessa started cutting the author out and trying to get Jason to stop seeing them. The author then discovered Tessa cheating with her ex and sent a photo to Jason, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the author is conflicted because they feel happy that Jason is back and their social circle is intact, but they also feel bad for Jason's heartbreak. The question is whether the author is an asshole for being happy.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author tried to help Jason before, and now their happiness comes from someone else's misfortune. On the other hand, the author's actions were to help their friend, and it's natural to feel relieved when a toxic situation ends. The author might not be malicious; they might genuinely believe they're doing the right thing. However, being happy about someone else's pain, even if justified, could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut wait, the author's actions led to the breakup. They sent the photo, which caused the confrontation. Even if Tessa was cheating, the author's role in exposing it might make them complicit. However, they had a history of concern. It's also possible that the author's happiness stems from the positive outcome for their friendship, not from Jason's suffering. So maybe it's not entirely their fault. \n\nThe key is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that way. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. \n\nIn my opinion, while the author's intentions were to help Jason, feeling happy about the breakup because of the negative effects on Jason might not be malicious. The author's happiness could stem from the restoration of their friendship and the removal of a toxic person. However, taking pleasure in someone's emotional pain is problematic. The line is thin here. If the author is happy that Tessa is gone and Jason is free, that's different from being happy about Jason's heartbreak. If the author is secretly glad Jason is suffering, that's worse. The story mentions the author felt terrible for Jason but secretly was happy. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they might have mixed emotions. \n\nGiven the context, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions were to help a friend, and their happiness is due to the positive outcome for their social group. However, if the author derived joy from Jason's pain rather than the restoration of their friendship, then A would be correct. The story says the author felt terrible for Jason but was happy for their friends, so the main conflict is internal. The author isn't evil for feeling relief when a toxic relationship ends. So probably B.\n"
