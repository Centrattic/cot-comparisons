She had entered our circle of friends a few months prior to going out with Jason, and at first she was pretty cool.  But shortly after they got together her attitude changed.  Suddenly she didn't want to hang out whenever there would be other girls around because they all secretly wanted Jason according to her.  Then she didn't want to hang out with certain friends because they had girlfriends and that could mean other women around Jason and she just couldn't accept that.\n\nWell after awhile I brought all this behavior up to Jason and he made excuses for Tessa about how she's \"just the jealous type\" and \"that's just how she is.\"  I told him that was bullshit, and that these are all huge red flags.  I knew that was all I could really do so I dropped it.  At some point Jason must have told Tessa about our conversation because suddenly she would refuse to hang out if I was there.  Then she started trying to get Jason to stop hanging out with me all together.  Luckily this was one of Jason's hills to die on and he made her back off when it came to me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago and I caught Tessa out on a date with some guy I didn't recognize.  They were at a small restaurant known for being a date spot.  I took a picture of them eating at one of the outside tables and sent it to Jason.  He called me almost immediately and all he said was \"that's her fucking ex.  I'll be there soon.\"  He hung up and just as they were about to leave Jason pulled up and started a shouting match with Tessa.\n\nThe TLDR of the fight.  Tessa denied anything was going on.  Guy then immediately called her out saying she had told him that Jason had broken up with her.  Tessa then stared open mouthed at him for a minute before crying and wailing about how they were ganging up on her and refused to hear the truth. Then when she noticed me standing about 10 feet back she started shrieking about how I ruined everything.  I just stood there stunned.  Ex left, and Jason and I met back at his place to pack up her shit and left it in the driveway for her to pick up.\n\nJason spent the next couple days at my place and I took a day off to keep an eye on him.  He was heartbroken.  He had even planned on proposing to her once he was situated in his new job.  I felt terrible for him, but secretly inside I was doing backflips.  Jason just left this morning to go back to living at his place, and as soon as his car was out of sight I started dancing around the living room singing \"ding dong the witch is dead!\" \n\nThis is where I am conflicted.  Because I honestly feel more glad that my friends and I get Jason back than I feel bad for Jason that he is going through all these horrible things.  Does this make me an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, a best friend of Jason, was happy when Jason's relationship with Tessa ended. The question is whether the author is an asshole for feeling that way.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was concerned about Tessa's behavior, which included becoming jealous of other friends, isolating Jason from the group, and then cheating. The author had warned Jason about these red flags, but Jason didn't take action. Then, the author found out that Tessa was cheating with her ex, and sent a picture to Jason, which led to the breakup. The author felt happy about the breakup and even celebrated, which is causing the conflict in their feelings.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had valid concerns about Tessa's behavior, tried to warn Jason, and later found out she was cheating. The author's actions (sending the photo) directly led to the breakup. Now, they're conflicted between feeling relieved that Jason is free from what they saw as a toxic relationship and feeling bad about Jason's heartbreak.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being happy. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider if the author did anything unethical. They confronted Jason about the red flags, which is a friend's responsibility. Then, when they saw Tessa cheating, sending the picture seems like trying to protect their friend. However, the author might have overstepped by interfering in the relationship, but given the cheating, it was probably justified.\n\nThe author's happiness stems from the positive outcome of the friend's circle getting Jason back and the relationship ending, which had issues. While it's natural to feel some satisfaction when a friend is in a bad situation, the author's actions were aimed at helping Jason. The real issue is the author's mixed emotions and whether celebrating the breakup is wrong. But since the relationship was harmful, the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did interfere by sending the photo, which might have been a direct cause of the breakup. However, Tessa was cheating, so the author's action was a response to that. The main conflict is the emotional reaction, not the action of sending the photo. The author feels glad that Jason is no longer with someone who was emotionally abusive and cheating. In that case, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling happy because the relationship had serious issues.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author acted in what they believed was their friend's best interest, addressed valid concerns, and the breakup resulted from Tessa's cheating. Feeling relieved and happy is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
