I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The author's situation is a bit complicated. He had a one-night stand and the woman got pregnant. He ended up being the father to his daughter, and now he has a son with his current wife. The daughter is about to go to grad school and asked him to help, but he's not paying. He lists several reasons: he pays child support that's significant, the daughter wants an expensive school, he already gave her a car, the mother can afford it, and the son's major is more practical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is the biological father of both children, but the daughter comes from an accidental situation. He might feel differently towards each child because of their different mothers' circumstances. The daughter's mom is wealthy, while his wife isn't. But does that justify treating them differently? \n\nThe daughter feels he's being sexist because he's paying for the son but not her. The author argues that he's contributing more via child support than what he pays for the son. But the daughter might see it as unequal treatment. The author also mentions the practicality of the majors, but that's a subjective choice. The key issue is fairness between the children. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, even if the author is providing other things (like the car), financial support for education is a big part. The daughter might feel entitled to the same support as her brother. The author's refusal could be seen as unfair if he's the biological father and has the means. However, there's the aspect of the mothers' financial situations. The author might argue that he's not responsible for the daughter's education since the mother can afford it, but he's still the father, so there's a moral obligation. \n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which is a court-mandated payment. But financially supporting education beyond that isn't always required unless specified. So legally, he's not necessarily wrong. However, morally, if he can afford to help both, some might say he should. The daughter's reaction was harsh, but the author's refusal might have been perceived as neglectful. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes practical considerations, like the different costs and the majors. But those might not be valid reasons for discrimination. Also, the author's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" suggests bias, which could contribute to his decision. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on societal norms and personal ethics. Many would argue that as a parent, he should treat both children equally in terms of support, regardless of their mothers' situations. The fact that the daughter was unexpected might affect his feelings, but legally and morally, he's still responsible. The author's decision might be understandable, but ethically questionable. So the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). But given the daughter's perspective and the potential for unequal treatment, leaning towards A.\n"
