I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father, the author of the AITA post, is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. \n\nFirst, the situation: The father had a one-night stand that resulted in a child, his daughter. He stepped up as a father, pays child support, and has been supporting her financially, including buying her a car. Now, the daughter is upset because he's paying for his son's undergrad (a different mother) but not her grad school. She feels it's unfair and he's being sexist. \n\nLooking at the points he gives:\n1. He pays child support, which is a legal requirement and a significant amount. Courts determined this, so he can't lower it. So he's already contributing financially to the daughter's upbringing.\n2. The daughter wants to attend an expensive private grad school, while the son is going to a cheaper state school. The cost difference is huge. The father might feel this is a financial strain.\n3. He gave the daughter a car, which is a big expense, while the son got a game console. That shows he's already provided her with a major gift.\n4. The daughter's mother earns a high salary, so she can afford her education. The son's mother has a low income and needs help.\n5. The son is studying Computer Science, which is practical, while the daughter's field is considered \"useless\" (like gender studies). The father might feel the son's choice is more lucrative and worth investing in.\n\nBut let's think about fairness. The father is treating the two children differently based on financial circumstances and his own biases. The daughter is his biological child, but he's paying for the son's undergrad. The daughter is in a different financial situation because her mother is wealthier. However, the daughter is now in grad school, which might be more of a personal investment, and she's asking for help. \n\nThe father's reasoning includes financial constraints and the daughter's mother's ability to pay. But if the daughter's mother is able to pay, maybe the father isn't obligated to contribute. However, the daughter might feel that despite the mother's income, the father should still help, especially since he's paying for the son. There's also the issue of the father's bias towards the son's major being more practical, which could be seen as sexist if he's undervaluing the daughter's field of study.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but it's possible she felt neglected. The father's response might come off as dismissive, not considering her feelings. He might be in the wrong for treating his children unequally without a clear, fair rationale. Even if his reasons are valid, the way he handled the situation and the daughter's feelings could mean he's not being fair.\n\nAlso, the father's comment about the daughter's field of study being \"useless\" is problematic. That's a subjective judgment and could contribute to the daughter feeling undervalued. The father's justification for not helping with grad school might be based on his own biases, not just financial reasons.\n\nSo, considering all that, the father may be in the wrong because he's treating his children differently based on subjective criteria and not addressing the daughter's feelings adequately. Even if he has valid financial reasons, the way he's handling it and the underlying biases (like deeming certain majors useless) contribute to the problem.\n"
