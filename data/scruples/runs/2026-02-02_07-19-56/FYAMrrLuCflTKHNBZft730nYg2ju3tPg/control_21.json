I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The parent gives several reasons, like child support already covering the daughter's expenses, the daughter's mother being wealthy, the son's more practical major, and the daughter's expensive private school choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They have a daughter from a one-night stand, stepped up as a father, and are now being asked to pay for her grad school. They argue that they already pay child support, which is a court-ordered obligation. They also mention contributing other gifts, like a car, and that their son's education is more affordable. The daughter is upset, feeling discriminated against based on her parent's \"real\" family.\n\nNow, the parent is asking if they're in the wrong. The key factors here are fairness, intentions, and societal expectations. The parent does acknowledge the daughter, provides support through child support, and gives a car. However, the daughter is being asked to pay for grad school, which is a higher expense. The parent's reasons include financial disparities between the two families and the majors chosen.\n\nBut is it wrong to differentiate between children? Parents often prioritize based on various factors. However, some might argue that once a parent chooses to support a child, they should treat all children equally. The parent is paying for the son's undergrad but not the daughter's grad, which could be seen as unequal treatment. But the daughter's mother is financially capable, while the son's mother is not. The parent is also contributing more in child support than they would for their son.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is intense, but the parent feels it's a misunderstanding. The parent might not be in the wrong if they're fulfilling their obligations and providing support, even if it's not equal. However, the perception of the daughter feeling less valued could be an issue. But since the parent is paying child support and contributing gifts, maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a subjective situation, but the parent's actions are based on financial factors and court obligations.\n"
