I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand and didn't want the child, but ended up being a father. He pays child support for the daughter, which is court-ordered and significant. He also has a son with his wife, who has a low income. The daughter now wants him to help with grad school because he's helping the son. The son is going to a cheaper state school, while the daughter is pursuing a more expensive private grad program. The father lists reasons: he's already paying child support, the daughter's mom is wealthy, and the son's major is practical versus the daughter's which he considers \"useless.\"\n\nNow, the key points here. The father is legally obligated to pay child support for the daughter, which is a court decision. That means he's already contributing financially. However, the daughter is now asking for additional support for grad school. The father is not required to pay for that; he's choosing to help his son. But the daughter feels it's unfair since he's helping the son. The father argues that the son's education is more practical and cheaper, and the daughter's mother is better off financially.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, the father is not legally required to pay for the daughter's education beyond child support. But the question is about morality, not legality. The daughter is an adult now, about to graduate undergrad. The father's decision to help the son but not her might be seen as inconsistent, especially since he's already paying child support. Also, he gave the daughter a car, which was expensive, so his argument about not paying for her education might not hold as well. The father is using the mother's financial status as a reason, but it's the daughter's choice to attend school, so the mother's income might not be the father's responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, the father's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" is problematic. It's a judgment of her career choice, which could be seen as dismissive. The daughter's reaction was angry, but the father's response about not being a bank and calling her disrespectful might come off as dismissive as well. The fact that he's paying for his son, who is part of his current family, while the daughter is part of a previous relationship, might create a perception of favoritism, even if it's not intentional.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, even though the father has legal obligations to the daughter, his decision not to help with grad school while helping the son could be seen as unfair. The daughter is an adult making her own educational choices, and the father's refusal might be based on financial priorities, but not supporting her despite his ability to do so (since he's a civil engineer with a decent salary) could be seen as the wrong choice. The fact that he paid for the car but not the education might highlight inconsistency in his support. The use of derogatory comments about her major also adds to the issue.\n\nTherefore, the father might be in the wrong for not supporting his daughter's educational goals when he can afford it, especially given the daughter's argument that he's helping the son. The daughter's anger is justified if she feels she's being treated differently. The father's justification about the mother's income is a bit of a red herring; the daughter's education is her responsibility, but he's choosing to help. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
