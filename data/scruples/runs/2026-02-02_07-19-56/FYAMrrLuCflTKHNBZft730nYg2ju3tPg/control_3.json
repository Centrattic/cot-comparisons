I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The father has a daughter from a one-night stand and a son with his current wife. He pays child support for the daughter, which is a significant amount. The daughter is now asking for help with grad school, which is expensive. The father lists several reasons: he's already paying child support, the daughter's school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom can afford it, and the son's major is more practical.\n\nFirst, legal obligations: the father is paying child support as mandated by the court. That's his responsibility, and it's a substantial contribution. The daughter's mom is financially stable, so maybe the father isn't the primary caregiver beyond support payments. The son's mother is less financially stable, so helping with his education might be a way to support both the son and the wife.\n\nThe daughter is upset because she feels she's being treated unfairly compared to the son. The father isn't providing financial support beyond child support, which might not cover college costs. However, the father isn't legally obligated to pay for her college education unless specified in the child support agreement. The daughter's claim that he's sexist might be an overreaction, but the father's refusal could be seen as unequal treatment, especially since he's paying for the son. But there are mitigating factors like the different financial situations and educational choices.\n\nThe daughter's field of study is mentioned as \"useless,\" which is a subjective judgment. The father's decision might be influenced by the perceived practicality of the majors, which could be biased. However, the daughter is an adult, and the father isn't necessarily required to support her indefinitely. The emotional response from the daughter is intense, but the father is within his rights to set boundaries on his finances, especially given his existing obligations.\n\nConsidering all factors, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's fulfilling his legal duties, and his reasons for not paying grad school are based on financial and practical considerations. The daughter's accusation of sexism might not hold up given the context, but the situation is complex. The key is whether he has a legal or moral obligation beyond what he's already doing. Since he's not the custodial parent for the daughter and has a different financial arrangement with the son's mother, his decision to prioritize the son's education due to his wife's financial situation is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
