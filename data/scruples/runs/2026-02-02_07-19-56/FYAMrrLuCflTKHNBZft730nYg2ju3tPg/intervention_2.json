I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the father paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand that resulted in a daughter. He didn't plan to be a father but stepped up. Now, the daughter is upset because he's paying for his son's education but not hers, leading her to call him sexist. The author lists several reasons: child support already pays a significant amount, the daughter's grad school is more expensive, he gave her a car instead of money, the other parent is wealthy, and the son's major is more practical.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are fairness between the children and the father's justification. The author is a civil engineer with a good salary. He's paying child support that's calculated by the court, which is a significant amount. The daughter's mom earns a high salary, while the son's mom has a low income. The son's education is cheaper, and the author has already given the daughter a car. Also, the daughter chose a graduate program in a field he deems \"useless,\" which adds to his hesitation.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, even though the father is paying child support, which is a legal obligation, the daughter might feel he should contribute more to her education. However, the father is making a choice based on his perception of the value of the education and the financial situations of the mothers involved. He's also considering that the son's education is more practical, which might influence his decision.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is intense, calling him sexist, but the father's reasoning is based on several factors beyond just financial support. The issue here is whether it's fair to treat two children differently based on their parents' financial situations and the perceived value of their chosen fields. Legally, he's fulfilling his child support, but emotionally and ethically, the daughter might feel neglected. The author might be in the wrong if he's showing favoritism based on arbitrary factors, but his reasons do have some merit. However, dismissing her field of study as \"useless\" could be a problematic bias, contributing to the daughter's hurt feelings. So, while he has his reasons, his attitude towards her choice of major and the way he's handling the situation might be contributing to the conflict. The answer might be A, but there are nuances.\n"
