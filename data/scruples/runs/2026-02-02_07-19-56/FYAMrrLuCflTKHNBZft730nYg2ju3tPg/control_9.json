I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider several factors.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand and the mother decided to keep the child. He stepped up to be a father, so he's been involved. Now, the daughter is upset because he's paying for his son's undergrad but not her grad school. Let's look at his reasons. \n\nHe mentions paying child support which is a legal obligation, and he argues that he contributes more to his daughter than his son. That's a point in his favor. He also points out that the daughter's grad school is more expensive, while the son's is cheaper. The daughter's mom has a higher salary, whereas his wife has a lower income. The son's major is practical, while the daughter's is seen as less so by the father.\n\nBut here's where it gets tricky. The father is using the term \"real family\" for his son, implying that the daughter isn't part of his real family, which could be a problematic mindset. Even though he's the biological father to both, the daughter is from a different mother. By differentiating between \"real\" and not, it could be seen as unfair or biased. \n\nHe also mentions that he gave the daughter a car, which is a significant gift, but the son got a game console. The daughter is now in her late 20s and pursuing grad school, which is a big investment. The father's refusal might be based on financial considerations, but is it fair? The daughter's mom can afford to pay, but the father is being asked to supplement. However, the father's own wife can't contribute much, so he's helping his son more. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was strong, but the father's response in calling her a \"sexist asshole\" when he says he didn't mean it that way might be part of the problem. Also, the term \"useless\" to describe her chosen field is judgmental and could contribute to her feeling disrespected. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, treating children differently based on their parents or perceived practicality of their majors might not be fair. The father's actions could be seen as inconsistent or biased, even if he has logical reasons. The key issue is whether the father's treatment is fair and not based on discriminatory attitudes. The use of terms like \"real family\" and judging the daughter's academic choices as \"useless\" might indicate an underlying bias, making him the asshole despite his financial reasons.\n"
