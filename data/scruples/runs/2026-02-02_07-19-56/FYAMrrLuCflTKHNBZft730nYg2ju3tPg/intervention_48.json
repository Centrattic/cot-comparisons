I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father had a one-night stand that resulted in a child, a daughter. He stepped up to be a father, paying child support. Now, the daughter is upset because he's paying for her half-brother's undergrad but not her grad school. She accuses him of caring more about his \"real\" family, which is a bit confusing because the son is also his child, just with a different mother. \n\nThe father lists several reasons: he's already paying significant child support, the daughter's grad school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, her mother can afford it, and the son's major is more practical. He also mentions that the daughter reacted angrily, calling him a sexist asshole.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. He's a civil engineer, so presumably has a good income. He's paying a significant amount in child support for the daughter. The daughter's mom earns more than the wife (son's mom), so maybe the father feels it's fairer that the daughter's mom covers more of her education. The son is going to a cheaper state school, so the father's contribution is less. The daughter's grad school is expensive, and he's not willing to pay. The son's major is practical (CS), while the daughter's is something else, which he deems \"useless.\" That seems like a judgment call.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to judge a field of study as \"useless\"? That could come off as dismissive. Also, the father gave the daughter a car but not the son, which might be seen as unequal. The daughter feels he's favoring the son, but the father argues it's due to financial contributions and practicality.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the father is making distinctions based on economic factors and the children's choices. But is that justifiable? He's the father to both, regardless of the mothers. The daughter's accusation of sexism is a bit unclear since both are his children. But maybe she's referring to favoring the son's family because of the mother's income differences. \n\nHe also mentioned he tried to lower the child support but failed. So he's already contributing more to the daughter's upbringing. If her mother can afford her grad school, maybe that's a point. But the daughter's argument is that he's not contributing at all to her education, which might feel like a lack of support. The father's response that his money is his and he's not a bank might be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but her feelings are valid if she feels neglected. The father's justification might be seen as prioritizing practicality and financial responsibility, but maybe he's overlooking her perspective. The key issue is whether it's fair to pay for the son but not the daughter based on the given reasons. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, parents often help children based on their own means and the child's needs. However, treating siblings differently can lead to resentment. The father's reasons are logical from a financial standpoint, but the emotional impact on the daughter is significant. \n\nThe father's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" is problematic, as it undermines her choice. Also, the car gift versus a game console might contribute to feelings of inequality. The fact that he's paying child support, which is a legal obligation, but still feels it's fair to not contribute to grad school is a point. However, the daughter may argue that her education is her choice and she's worked for it, so expecting her to cover it fully might not be fair. \n\nIn conclusion, the father's actions are based on financial and practical considerations, but they may have caused emotional harm. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the differential treatment is justified. The answer might hinge on whether the reasons are seen as fair and if the father's response to the daughter's anger was appropriate. The daughter's accusation of sexism is a red herring, but the underlying issue is fairness and communication. The father's justification is logical, but the emotional neglect might make him the asshole.\n"
