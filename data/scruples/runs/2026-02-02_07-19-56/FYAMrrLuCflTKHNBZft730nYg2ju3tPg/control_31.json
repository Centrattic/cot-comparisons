I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a one-night stand that resulted in a pregnancy. He became the father of a daughter, and now he's also a father to a son from a different relationship. The daughter is about to graduate undergrad and wants help with grad school, but he's not paying for her despite paying for his son. The daughter is upset, accusing him of caring more about his \"real\" family. The author lists several reasons against helping her: child support, cost differences, gifts given, financial situations of both mothers, and the choice of major.\n\nSo the main question is whether his reasoning is valid or if he's being unfair. Let's look at the factors he mentions. He's paying child support, which is court-mandated, but he's also paying for his son's education. The daughter's grad school is expensive, while the son's undergrad is cheaper. He gave the daughter a car, which was a significant expense. The daughter's mom earns more, while the son's mom's income is lower. The son's major is considered practical, whereas the daughter's isn't. The author argues that he's not a bank and that the money is his, but the daughter feels it's unfair.\n\nNow, considering fairness and potential biases. The author is a father to both children. Even though the daughter came from a one-night stand, he's been a father figure to her. The fact that he's paying for the son's education but not the daughter's grad school might come across as unequal treatment. The reasons he gives\u2014financial contributions through child support, cost differences, and the daughter's mother's higher income\u2014might not fully justify the discrepancy. Especially since he already spends a lot on child support, which is a legal obligation, but choosing to fund one child's education over another could be seen as favoritism.\n\nAlso, the daughter's major being labeled \"useless\" by the author raises questions about his personal biases. It's not up to him to decide what's a useful major; that's her choice. The way he refers to it as \"useless\" might reflect his own values rather than hers. Furthermore, the daughter's reaction, while perhaps over the top, is a response to feeling neglected. He called her a \"disrespectful\" and said the argument was \"trivial,\" which might dismiss her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are fairness in treatment, the justification for unequal support, and potential biases. Even if he has financial reasons, treating one child differently can be harmful. The fact that he's paying for the son's undergrad while contributing through child support to the daughter might not be balanced enough. The daughter's grad school is a separate expense, and if he's willing to pay for his son's undergrad, why not contribute to her grad school? The cost difference is a factor, but the underlying issue is fairness. The author's reasoning about the mother's income is a bit of a cop-out since the daughter's education is her responsibility. Also, the fact that he's giving different gifts (car vs. games) might contribute to her feeling of inequality.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, parents are generally expected to support all their children equitably. Even if the daughter is from a different mother, the author is still her father. The child support is a legal requirement, but educational support is a different matter. His argument that the daughter's mother earns more might not absolve him of responsibility, especially if he has the means. The daughter's accusation of sexism is a strong word, but the core issue is unequal treatment. Whether he's sexist or just biased is debatable, but the outcome is that he's treating his children differently without a solid ethical justification beyond personal financial preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning doesn't fully address the fairness of his actions. While he has valid points about costs and financial contributions, the unequal treatment of his children, especially given his role as a father to both, suggests he is in the wrong. The daughter's reaction, though intense, is a response to feeling undervalued. The author's dismissal of her feelings as \"disrespectful\" and his own biases about her major contribute to the problem. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
