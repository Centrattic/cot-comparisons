I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's paying for his son's college but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter is upset about this difference, and the father lists several reasons why he's not paying for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father had a one-night stand and the mother decided to keep the child. He stepped up as a father, so maybe he feels some obligation but not the same as with his biological son. The daughter is now going to grad school, which is expensive, and she's comparing it to her half-brother's undergrad.\n\nThe father's reasons include child support, which is court-mandated, and he's contributing more to the daughter already. The daughter's mom is wealthier, while the son's mother is poorer. The daughter wants to attend a private grad school, which is more expensive. The son is going to a state school. Also, the son's major is practical, while the daughter's is considered \"useless\" by the father. The father also gave the daughter a car, which he didn't do for the son.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, even though the father has different financial arrangements with each parent, the daughter might feel he's showing favoritism. The father's argument about child support being court-ordered doesn't necessarily justify not helping with grad school. The daughter's anger could stem from feeling undervalued or that her education isn't as important. The father's dismissal of her field of study as \"useless\" is problematic because it's subjective and might devalue her choices. The way he responded, calling her disrespectful and not addressing her feelings, might have escalated the conflict. The term \"sexist\" is thrown around, but the issue might be more about perceived unfair treatment rather than gender-based discrimination.\n\nThe key here is whether the father's actions are discriminatory. Since the children are of different parents and different circumstances, it's a complex situation. However, treating children differently based on their parents' financial situations could be seen as unfair, especially if the father is making personal choices despite the court's mandate. The daughter might feel that her needs are being overlooked. The father's reasoning about the practicality of majors could be a personal opinion but might come off as dismissive. The fact that he's giving different gifts (car vs. games) might contribute to the daughter feeling less supported.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people believe parents should treat all their children equally, regardless of circumstances. However, the legal and financial realities here are different. The father is not the sole parent for the daughter, so the responsibility might be shared with the mother. Still, the daughter could feel he's not fulfilling his role as a father in a supportive way. The emotional response from the daughter, while strong, is a reaction to feeling neglected. The father's response might have been too harsh, not validating her feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the father's actions could be seen as unfair from the daughter's perspective, even if he has valid reasons. The way he dismissed her education choice and his harsh reaction might contribute to the conflict. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But there's also the legal aspect and differing financial responsibilities. However, since the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he's showing preferential treatment and not addressing her feelings adequately.\n"
