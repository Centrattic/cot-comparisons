I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a father paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The question is whether that's fair or if he's being sexist.\n\nFirst, the author explains his situation. He had a one-night stand and a daughter from that, which he didn't plan. He stepped up as a father. Now, his daughter is upset because he's helping his son (his half-brother) with college but not contributing to her grad school. The reasons given are child support, the daughter's expensive school, the car he bought her, the mothers' incomes, and the choice of majors.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my take. Let's break it down. The father is already paying child support, which the courts deemed necessary. He's also paying for his son's undergrad. The daughter is now in grad school, which is more expensive. The father argues that the son's major is practical, while the daughter's isn't. But is that a valid reason? Also, the mother's salary vs. his wife's\u2014maybe the daughter's mother can afford it, while he's helping the other family because they can't.\n\nBut the author's reasoning might be seen as discriminatory. For example, saying a degree is \"useless\" based on the field could be biased. Also, the comment about \"real family\" might be hurtful and imply that the daughter isn't as important. The way he reacts to her anger\u2014telling her to enjoy his real family\u2014could be seen as dismissing her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, he's already contributing through child support, which is a legal obligation. The daughter's mother earns more, so maybe it's fair that she's the one paying for grad school. But the father could be seen as inconsistent because he gave the daughter a car from his own money, which is a significant expense, yet not the grad school. That might look unequal.\n\nThe key points here are the disparity in treatment and the reasons given. The author's justification might not hold up because it's based on subjective factors like the usefulness of a degree or favoring one child over another. Also, the way he dismissed the daughter's feelings, even if he didn't mean it, could be harmful. The daughter's anger is a reaction to feeling undervalued, which the father's response might not address properly.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if there are valid financial reasons, the way he's handling it could be seen as unfair or sexist. The author might be in the wrong because the reasoning lacks objectivity and could be discriminatory. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
