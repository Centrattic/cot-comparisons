I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the father) is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand and ended up having a daughter. He stepped in as a father, though. Now the daughter is about to graduate and wants him to help with grad school, but he's planning to pay for his son's undergrad. The daughter feels he's favoring his \"real\" family (the son). The father lists several reasons: he pays child support that's significant, the daughter's school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom is wealthy, and the son's major is practical versus the daughter's \"useless\" major.\n\nHmm. Let's see. The key issues here might be fairness, the reasons given, and the daughter's perception. The father is paying for the son's undergrad, which is a different level of education compared to grad school. But he's not paying for his daughter's grad school. The daughter might feel that since he's paying for the son's undergrad, he should contribute to her grad school. However, his reasons include financial obligations through child support, the daughter's mother being able to afford it, and the practicality of the son's major.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to compare undergrad and grad school? The father's contribution might depend on the circumstances of each child. The daughter's mom is wealthy, so maybe the father feels less obligation. However, the daughter might feel he's being inconsistent. The father's argument about practicality of majors might come off as dismissive, which could hurt the daughter's feelings. Also, the way he responded when she got angry\u2014telling her to talk when she's less emotional\u2014might not help the situation.\n\nThe father's reasons have some merit, especially regarding financial support through child support and the daughter's mother being able to pay. However, treating his son differently from his daughter could be seen as unfair, especially if the daughter feels entitled to the same level of support. The term \"useless\" to describe the daughter's major is problematic and could contribute to her feeling undervalued. The father's response that he's not a bank and his money is his own might be justifiable, but the daughter's emotional reaction is valid if she feels he's not supporting her as he does her brother. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people might expect parents to support children equally, but there are exceptions based on financial situations. The father's situation is a bit unique because the children are from different parents, which complicates things. However, the daughter's argument that she's being treated differently because of which family is considered \"real\" might touch on deeper issues of fairness and parental responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all this, the father might not be entirely wrong, but his handling of the situation could be seen as contributing to the problem. The key is whether the differences in support are justified and communicated respectfully. The father's reasons are valid, but the way he's explaining and defending them, especially calling a major \"useless,\" might be where he's in the wrong. The daughter's feelings are important, and if the father's actions are causing her to feel less valued, that could be an issue. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the father being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
