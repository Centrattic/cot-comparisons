I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the father is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter is upset about this, and the father explains several reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the arguments. The father had a one-night stand and became a father to the daughter. He's been paying child support, which is court-mandated, and he's contributing more to her than he does to his son. He mentions differences in the children's schools, the daughter attending a more expensive private school, and the son going to a cheaper state school. Also, he gave the daughter a car, while the son got a game console. The mother of the daughter has a higher income compared to his wife, who runs a small business. The daughter's chosen field is considered less practical by the father, which might influence his decision.\n\nNow, the daughter is angry, feeling discriminated against. The father claims he's not sexist, but the daughter feels he loves his \"real\" family more. The key points here are fairness, the reasons given for not paying, and whether those reasons are valid or justifiable.\n\nThe father's reasoning includes financial obligations already set by court (child support), which is a significant point. Since child support is legally mandated, he might not have a choice in that. However, the daughter's mother is able to pay for her education, which he points out. Additionally, the son's major is more practical, which could be a factor in the father's decision to invest in that education. The daughter's graduate program is more expensive, which might be a financial burden he's not willing to take on.\n\nBut on the other hand, treating children differently based on their parents, the gender of the child, or their chosen field might be seen as unfair. The father is the biological father of the son, while the daughter is from a one-night stand. Even though he stepped up to be a father, there might be underlying biases there. Also, the daughter might feel that despite the father's support, she's being treated differently because of her mother's financial situation. However, the father is already paying child support, so maybe he feels that's his responsibility, and the education is an extra that he's not obligated to provide.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but her feelings of being treated unfairly are valid if the father's actions are perceived as unequal treatment without just cause. The father's reasons include existing child support, the cost difference, the daughter's mother's ability to pay, and the choice of major. However, if the father is able to pay for his son's education despite his wife's lower income, maybe the issue is that he's prioritizing his biological child over the daughter, which could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nAnother angle is that the daughter is now in grad school, which is a further step than undergrad. If the father didn't pay for her undergrad, that might be a different issue, but he did pay for the son's undergrad. However, the daughter is asking for supplementary help, not full payment. The father might be overextending by helping with grad school, especially if it's expensive. But the daughter's mother's higher income could mean the father should not be expected to help if the mother can afford it. Yet, the daughter might still feel the father should contribute, especially if he has the means.\n\nThe father's argument about the daughter's major being \"useless\" could be a bias. Judging a degree's worthiness based on perceived job market is problematic. That could come off as dismissive of her interests and goals.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the father is in a legally binding situation with child support for the daughter, which is higher due to his higher salary. He's already contributing more to her via child support. However, the daughter's education is separate from child support. If the father is paying for the son's education but not the daughter's, even though the daughter's mother can afford it, that might not be the father's responsibility. But if the father is able and the daughter is his child, some might argue he should help equally.\n\nThe key is whether the father's reasons are justifiable. The court-mandated child support is a strong point. Also, the daughter's mother's higher income reduces the father's obligation. The difference in education costs and majors might also be valid. However, the perception of favoritism based on gender or biological relation could still make him in the wrong, even if the reasons are practical.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the reasons are legitimate and he's not obligated to pay for the daughter's grad school, then B (not in the wrong). But if the unequal treatment is based on gender or unfair biases, then A (in the wrong). The father's reasoning includes valid points like financial obligations and the daughter's mother's ability, but the dismissal of the daughter's chosen field and the potential for perceived favoritism might tip it towards A. However, since he's already paying more in child support, and the daughter's mother can afford her education, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B because his reasons have merit and the daughter's mother can cover the costs. But the way he dismisses her major and the possible underlying biases might complicate that.\n"
