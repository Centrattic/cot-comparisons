I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the father is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter feels it's unfair, especially since he pays child support and has already given her a car. The father lists several reasons: he's paying child support which is a court-ordered amount, the daughter went to an expensive private school while the son is going to a cheaper state school, he already gave her a car, her mom is wealthy, and the son's major is practical whereas her graduate studies are seen as less useful. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Even though the daughter is from a different mother, is it fair to treat her differently? The father is a civil engineer with a decent salary, contributing significantly through child support. But the daughter might feel that her father isn't treating her equally. The father's reasons are valid in a legal and financial sense, but how does that translate to fairness?\n\nThe daughter is graduating undergrad and wants grad school. The father isn't paying for her undergrad, maybe assuming her mom is handling that. But he's paying for the son's undergrad. The daughter's argument is that since he's paying for his other child, he should also help her. The father argues about financial contributions through child support, which the court ordered, but does that mean he's already contributing more than he should? \n\nAlso, the daughter's mom has a high salary, so maybe she can afford to pay for grad school. The father's wife, the son's mom, has a lower income, so helping the son might be more necessary. But is it fair to the daughter to not have that support? The father's reasons about the car and the son's video games are about the resources given to each child. The father gave a more expensive gift to the daughter, but that's not education-related. \n\nThe daughter's major being \"useless\" is a subjective judgment. The father might be biased towards practical degrees, but that's his opinion. The daughter's choice of grad school is in a field he considers less useful, which might affect his willingness to support it. However, that's a personal choice, and it's not fair to dismiss her goals based on that. \n\nThe emotional response from the daughter is intense\u2014calling him a sexist asshole. That's harsh, but maybe the father's decision is also unfair. The father says he's a good father by visiting her every other weekend, but financial support is another aspect. \n\nLegally, he's fulfilling his child support, which is a court order. But morally, is it right to not support her grad school when he's able? The daughter might feel neglected, even if the father is contributing in other ways. \n\nSo considering all this, is the father in the wrong? The father has valid financial and legal reasons, but the daughter's feelings of being treated unfairly might be justified. However, the father isn't legally obligated to pay for her education beyond child support. The question is about being in the wrong, which is more about moral responsibility. If the father can afford it and is choosing to not support her education, maybe he is in the wrong. But if he's already contributing through child support, and her mother is financially capable, perhaps he's not. \n\nThe key points are: he's paying child support, which is a legal obligation, and her mother's financial situation. The daughter's mom is wealthy enough to cover her education, so the father's decision might not be his fault. The son's wife's lower income makes the father's support more necessary for the son. Also, the daughter did graduate undergrad, so maybe she should have planned for grad school costs. The father's reasons about practical vs. non-practical majors are subjective but might influence his decision. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. The father isn't legally wrong, and he has his reasons. The daughter's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid given the situation. The father might be in the wrong for not explaining better or for the double standard, even if he has justifications. However, considering the financial contributions he's already making through child support and the other factors, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong, because he's fulfilling his legal obligations, the daughter's mother is financially capable, and the father has given her a car. But there's a moral argument either way. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the father isn't violating any laws or clear ethical standards beyond his own choices, the answer might be B.\n"
