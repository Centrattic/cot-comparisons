I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who's paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The daughter is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the points. The father had a one-night stand and the woman chose to keep the baby, so he became a father. Now, he's paying child support for his daughter, which is court-mandated. He's also paying for his son's undergrad. The daughter is asking for help with grad school, which is expensive, and he refuses. She's accusing him of favoring his \"real\" family, i.e., his son and wife.\n\nLooking at his reasons: 1. Child support is already a significant amount, so he's contributing more to the daughter than the son. 2. The grad school is a lot more expensive than the son's school. 3. He gave the daughter a car, the son got a game console. 4. The daughter's mom is wealthy, while the son's mom isn't. 5. The son's major is practical, the daughter's is considered \"useless.\"\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and perceived fairness. Legally, he's required to pay child support for the daughter, which is separate from choosing to pay for her education. The daughter feels it's unequal because he's paying for the son's education. But the father argues that his financial contributions are already higher due to child support and that the circumstances (costs, parents' incomes, majors) differ.\n\nHe also mentions that the daughter's mother is wealthy, so maybe she should rely on her. But the daughter might feel that the father should support her regardless of the mother's ability. The father's refusal could be seen as unfair if the daughter is also under the impression that he should contribute because he's her father. However, the father points out that child support is already a form of financial support.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is emotional, calling him a sexist asshole, which might be an overreaction. But the father's response about not being a bank and keeping his money as his own might come off as dismissive. \n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong because he's meeting his child support obligations. But ethically and emotionally, there's a gray area. The daughter might feel neglected, especially if she believes that the father should support both children equally. However, the father has valid reasons related to financial contributions, costs, and the different financial situations of the mothers. \n\nThe fact that the daughter's mom is wealthy while the son's mom isn't might justify the different treatment, as the father's son's mother has less income. But the daughter might not see it that way. The father could be seen as not wrong because he's fulfilling his legal obligations and making decisions based on practical considerations. However, the way he handled the conversation and dismissed her feelings might have added to the hurt.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer hinges on whether the father's decisions are fair. If the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's meeting his legal obligations and has valid reasons for the discrepancies. But some might argue A because it's about emotional family dynamics and equal treatment expectations.\n"
