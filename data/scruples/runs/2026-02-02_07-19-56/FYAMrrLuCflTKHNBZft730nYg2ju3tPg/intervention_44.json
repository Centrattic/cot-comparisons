I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dig into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and had a child with a woman. He stepped up as a father, which is commendable. Now, the daughter is in her final year of undergrad and wants help with grad school, which is expensive. The author is paying for his son's undergrad, which is cheaper, and not the daughter's grad school. \n\nThe reasons given are: he pays child support for the daughter, which is significant. He argues that he's already contributing more through child support. The daughter's grad school is at a private school, which is much more expensive. He also gave her a car, while the son got a game console. The daughter's mom is wealthy, whereas the son's mom isn't. The son is in a practical major, and the daughter in a less practical one. \n\nBut let's break this down. The author is paying for the son's undergrad, which the son's mother can't afford. However, he's not paying for the daughter's grad school, even though the daughter's mom is financially capable. The author mentions he's contributing child support, but that's legally required. Should he feel that's enough? Maybe the daughter expects more, especially since he's paying for his son's education. \n\nThere's also the issue of treating the children differently. The author is paying for the son's education, which might set a standard. If the daughter feels she's being treated unfairly, that's a valid concern. The author's reasoning about the majors might be biased. He dismisses the daughter's field of study as \"useless,\" which is a judgment call and could be sexist if he's underestimating her choice. \n\nThe daughter's reaction, while harsh, might stem from feeling undervalued. The author's response of \"enjoy your real family\" could imply a preference for his biological family, which is problematic. The financial arguments are valid to an extent, but the emotional aspect\u2014how the daughter feels about being treated differently\u2014can't be ignored. \n\nThe author might not be legally in the wrong, but ethically, he's creating a disparity between his children. The daughter might feel neglected, especially if the son is being supported while she's not. The author's justification about practical majors and the daughter's mother's income might be used to avoid responsibility, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has his reasons, the way he's handling it might be perceived as unfair or sexist by the daughter. The double standard in support could be the real issue here. So, he might be in the wrong.\n"
