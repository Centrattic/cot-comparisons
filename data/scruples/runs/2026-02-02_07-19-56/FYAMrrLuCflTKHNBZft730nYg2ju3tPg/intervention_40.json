I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The story is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and the woman got pregnant. He didn't want the baby but stepped up as a father. Now the daughter is about to graduate undergrad and wants help with grad school. The mother isn't paying, so she's asking the father. He's paying for his son's undergrad. The daughter gets angry, calls him sexist. The author lists several reasons: he pays child support which is significant, the son's school is cheaper, he already gave the daughter a car, the daughter's mom is wealthy while the son's mom isn't, and the son's major is practical versus the daughter's choice.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is wrong. The key points are about fairness and the reasons given. The author is a civil engineer with a decent salary. He's paying child support, which might be a legal obligation, but he's also choosing to pay for his son's college. The daughter feels it's unfair he's not helping her. The author argues that he's contributing more through child support and the daughter's mom is financially better off. But is it okay to differentiate between children based on their financial situations or their parents' salaries?\n\nThe daughter is his biological child, so he has a parental responsibility towards her regardless of the circumstances. Even though she's from a one-night stand, he's been a father to her. By not helping her with grad school, even though he's helping another child, could be seen as unfair. The argument that the daughter's mother is wealthy might not absolve him of his own responsibility. Also, the fact that he's paying more in child support than for the son's education might not be a valid reason to withhold support for the daughter's further education. \n\nThe author's reasons include the daughter's choice of major being \"useless,\" which is a bit judgmental. That could add to why the daughter feels disrespected. The way he responded to her anger, telling her he's enjoying his \"real family,\" might be dismissive. The daughter's emotional reaction is understandable given the situation. \n\nSo, while the author has his own justifications, treating children differently based on such factors can be seen as unfair. The fact that he's a father to both children, even if not married to the mothers, he has a responsibility to provide for both. The daughter's financial needs and her academic goals should be considered equally. The author's decision to prioritize one child over the other might be in the wrong, even if he's providing other forms of support like the car. The main issue is the perceived inequality in support for their education, which is a significant investment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
