I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is a father who had a one-night stand and ended up with a daughter. He's been paying child support for her, which is significant due to his job as a civil engineer. Now, his daughter is asking for help with grad school, but he's choosing to pay for his son's undergrad instead. The daughter got mad and accused him of caring more about his \"real\" family, and there was a heated exchange.\n\nFirst, the key points from the author's perspective: He's paying child support which is court-mandated, contributing more to his daughter than his son. The daughter's grad school is expensive, while the son's undergrad is cheaper. He already gave the daughter a car, and the daughter's mom is wealthy compared to his wife's income. The son is in a practical major, while the daughter's is seen as \"useless.\" The author feels he's not obligated to pay for grad school since it's not mandated, and he's already providing financial support through child support. He also mentions that the daughter's mom can afford her education, so maybe that's a factor.\n\nFrom the daughter's side, she might feel that since he's paying for his son's undergrad, he should help her with grad school. The fact that he's a civil engineer with a good salary might make her feel like he can afford to help her too. The accusation of sexism is a big point here\u2014she might feel he's showing favoritism based on gender or marital status. The argument about \"real family\" could imply that he's treating the son, who is with his wife, as more legitimate.\n\nLegally, the author is already fulfilling his obligation with child support. However, the ethical aspect is different. The daughter's mom isn't contributing, so maybe the author feels she should take responsibility. But the daughter might see the father's support as her right, especially if she's his child. The argument about the car versus a game console: the car was a significant investment, but grad school is another level. The author might feel that's enough, but the daughter sees it as insufficient.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes financial disparity between the two families and the practicality of the majors. But the daughter's major being deemed \"useless\" could be a bias against humanities or social sciences. That might contribute to the author's reluctance, but it's his own prejudice. Also, the way he cut off the conversation might not help the situation.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but the author's response was defensive. He might not see the emotional impact of his refusal, especially since he's been absent from her life except for every other weekend. The daughter might need more emotional and financial support, and his refusal could feel like abandonment.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, no\u2014child support is covered. Ethically, it's more complex. The daughter might feel entitled to support, especially if she believes the father is capable. The author's justification about financial contributions and the daughter's mother's income might be valid points, but the way he handles the situation could be seen as dismissive. The sexism accusation is serious, but the author might not see his actions as sexist, just practical. However, his treatment of the daughter's educational goals as \"useless\" could be part of a gendered bias. Overall, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's room for criticism, especially if he's contributing to inequality between his children. But the answer depends on whether the user wants a legal or ethical judgment. Since the question is about being in the wrong, which is more moral, the answer could be A (yes) or B (no). Considering the circumstances, maybe A, because the author's actions might perpetuate inequality despite his justifications, but others might argue B based on financial constraints and legal fulfillment.\n"
