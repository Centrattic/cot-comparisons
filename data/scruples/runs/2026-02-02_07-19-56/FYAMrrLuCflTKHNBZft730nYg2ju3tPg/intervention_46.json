I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter feels it's unfair, especially since the father contributes significantly through child support and other gifts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's reasoning. He mentions that he pays child support for the daughter, which the court mandated, and that he's given her a car, while the son gets a console. The daughter's mom is wealthy, whereas the son's mom isn't. Also, the son is going to a state school, and the daughter's grad program is expensive. The father is concerned about the practicality of the daughter's chosen field.\n\nBut looking at the daughter's perspective, even if the father provides child support, she might feel that he's not treating her the same as his legitimate child. The fact that he's paying for the son's undergrad but not her grad school could be seen as unfair, especially if she's expected to pay for her own graduate studies while the son's undergrad is covered. The father's decision not to help might come across as biased, regardless of the reasons he lists.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was intense, but her feeling hurt is understandable. The father's response could be perceived as dismissive or even discriminatory. The key here is whether the father's actions are justified. While his reasons are valid, the way he's handling it might not be fair. Children might not see the financial realities as clearly as adults, but the father's approach could damage the daughter's trust and self-worth.\n\nThe father's argument that the daughter's mom is wealthy is a point, but it's his responsibility to be fair in his own decisions. The daughter might feel he's abdicating his responsibility by not helping, even if the mother can afford it. Also, the father's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" is problematic, even if it's not explicitly stated. It suggests a lack of respect for her academic choices, which could contribute to her feeling undervalued.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the father might be overcompensating by considering the son's needs versus the daughter's. The daughter's grad school is more expensive, so the father's refusal might not be based on financial capacity but on personal bias. The fact that he gave her a car but not the son might also be a point of comparison for her.\n\nOverall, while the father has his reasons, his actions and the way he's handling the situation could be seen as unfair. The daughter's feelings are valid, and the father's response is dismissive. The answer might lean towards the father being in the wrong because fairness and perceived respect are important in parent-child relationships.\n"
