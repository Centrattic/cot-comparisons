I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author had a one-night stand and a daughter, then later married someone else and has a son. He's been paying child support for the daughter, which is court-ordered and significant. He's also given her a car, while the son gets a game console. The daughter is now upset that he's helping her son with undergrad but not her grad school, which is expensive. The author lists several reasons: child support already covers more for the daughter, the schools' costs differ, his wife's income is low compared to the daughter's mom, and the son's major is practical versus the daughter's. He also mentions the daughter's reaction as disrespectful.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Legally, child support is his responsibility for the daughter, but he's not legally obligated to pay for her education beyond that. The son is his legal child, so paying for his education might be part of his parental duties. However, the daughter's case is different because she's not his legal child, right? Wait, no\u2014the daughter is his biological child. So, if he's her legal father, maybe he has similar obligations. But in this case, he's already paying child support, which might cover certain expenses. But the question is whether he's wrong for not paying for her grad school.\n\nEthically, the daughter is his biological child, so she might expect some support. The author argues that he's already contributing more via child support and that the daughter's mom can afford her education. The son's mother can't, so he's helping there. But is there a double standard here? The daughter might feel that since he's the father, he should help regardless of the other parent's income. The author's point about the son's major being practical versus the daughter's might come off as dismissive of her academic interests, which could be sexist if he's undervaluing certain fields.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is intense, but the author's response was to tell her he's not a bank and to support her academically without financial help. He also called her disrespectful. The daughter's accusation of sexism might be valid if the author is treating his biological daughter differently because of gender, but he's actually treating them differently based on other factors like financial responsibility, the mother's income, and the purpose of the degrees. However, the way he phrases some points, like calling her field \"useless,\" might reflect bias.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's the father, shouldn't he support both children? But he's not legally obligated to pay for the daughter's grad school beyond child support. The daughter's mom is supposed to cover that. However, the daughter might feel he should help because he's her father. The author's reasons seem practical, but the way he treats the daughter's request as trivial and dismisses her field could be seen as unfair or sexist. The key is whether the author's actions are discriminatory based on gender or other factors. If he's making decisions based on practicality and financial circumstances rather than gender, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's showing favoritism towards his son, that's an issue. The daughter's anger stems from feeling neglected, but the author's reasons are based on existing obligations and financial realities. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there's room for nuance. The main point is that he's not legally or necessarily ethically wrong for choosing to help his son's education differently, especially given the financial circumstances and the court-mandated support for the daughter. However, the way he handled the conversation and dismissed her feelings might be problematic, but the question is specifically about being in the wrong regarding the payment decision.\n"
