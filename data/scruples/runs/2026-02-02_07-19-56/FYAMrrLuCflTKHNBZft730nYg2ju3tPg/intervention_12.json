I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation step by step. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points the author presented. The daughter is upset because she feels the father is favoring his \"real\" family (the son) over her. The father explains several reasons: he pays child support which is significant, the daughter's mom is wealthy, the daughter chose a more expensive school, and the son's major is more practical.\n\nThe father is a civil engineer with a decent salary. He's paying child support that's a significant portion of his income, which the courts mandated. He also gave the daughter a car, which is a big expense. The daughter's mom is in high 5-figure to low 6-figure salary, whereas the wife (son's mom) makes only $500 a month. The son's major is Computer Science, seen as practical, while the daughter's is in a field that's considered less lucrative, like Gender or Black Studies.\n\nThe daughter reacted angrily, calling him sexist. The father thinks she's blowing it out of proportion. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The main issue is fairness and the perception of favoritism. The father argues that he's contributing more to the daughter through child support and other expenses, and that the financial circumstances of each child's mother differ. However, the daughter feels he's not supporting her despite her own efforts. \n\nOn one hand, the father has valid reasons based on financial contributions and different family situations. On the other hand, the daughter might feel that her needs are being overlooked, especially since she's asking for help with grad school, which is a different scenario than undergrad. The father's decision not to pay could be seen as unfair, especially if he's the one making the child support payments and the daughter's mom is more financially stable. \n\nBut the father also has a right to manage his own money as he sees fit. However, the way he handled the conversation might have been insensitive. He dismissed her feelings and called her disrespectful, which could have escalated the conflict. \n\nThe key here is whether the father's actions are discriminatory. He's a father to both children, regardless of the circumstances. The daughter might feel that even with child support, she isn't getting the same support for her education as her half-brother. The father might be justifying it with different financial situations, but the daughter perceives it as a lack of love or favoritism. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the father is paying for the son's undergrad and not the daughter's grad, it might look unequal. The daughter's field of study being deemed \"useless\" is also a point of contention. The father's reasoning about the practicality of majors might be a biased view. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the father's actions might not be entirely unjustifiable, but the way he communicated and the potential for perceived favoritism could mean he's in the wrong. The daughter's feelings of being undervalued are important. Even if he's providing other forms of support, the emotional aspect and the sense of unfairness might make him the asshole here.\n"
