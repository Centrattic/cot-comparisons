I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father had a one-night stand and became the father of a daughter. He stepped up to be a father, but now there's a son from his current marriage. The daughter is upset because he's contributing to her half-brother's education but not hers. The father provides several reasons: he's already paying child support which is significant, the schools' costs differ, he already gave her a car, the daughter's mother is financially better off, and he thinks the daughter's major is less practical.\n\nThe key points here are fairness, intent, and the reasons given. The father is making a distinction between his children based on financial contributions, which might be seen as biased. Even if his reasons are valid (like the cost difference or the majors), treating his children differently could be seen as unfair, especially if it's based on gender. The daughter might feel that her needs are being undervalued compared to her brother's.\n\nThe father mentions he pays a significant amount in child support, which might cover some of her education costs indirectly, but that's not clear. Also, the daughter's mother's income is higher, which could mean she's expected to contribute more. However, the father's own statement about the daughter's major being \"useless\" might come off as dismissive of her choices, which could be a point against him.\n\nOn the other hand, the father has his own financial considerations and different circumstances with each child. His wife's lower income might necessitate helping the son more, but the daughter's mother is more capable. The daughter's reaction was harsh, but the father's response might have been dismissive of her feelings, which could be a problem.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's about intent and the fairness of the treatment. If the father's reasons are valid and he's acting in good faith, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's showing favoritism based on gender or dismissing his daughter's choices, then he could be. The fact that he gave the daughter a car and the son a game console also shows a difference in financial contributions beyond education, which might add to the daughter's perception of unfairness.\n\nI think there's a mix here. The father might have valid financial reasons, but the way he's handling it could be seen as unfair. The daughter's major being labeled as \"useless\" is a negative point. The father's refusal to help despite having already given her a car might not align with his stated reasons. Also, the daughter's mother's income being higher might not absolve him from helping if the daughter is in need.\n\nConsidering all this, the father might be in the wrong because he's treating his children differently in a way that could be perceived as favoritism, especially if the daughter's education is within his means and he's choosing not to help. The reasons given might not fully justify the disparity, especially if the daughter is in a less practical field but still deserves support. The father's dismissive attitude towards her feelings and her educational choices also contributes to the conflict.\n"
