I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The person is a father who is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter is upset about this difference, and the father lists several reasons why he's not paying for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was from a one-night stand, and the father stepped up to be a parent. He's paying child support, which is court-ordered, and he argues that he's already contributing more through that. He also mentions the child support is significant because of his salary. The key points here are the financial responsibilities, the different educational paths chosen by the kids, and the daughter's accusation of sexism.\n\nThe father lists several reasons: the daughter's school is more expensive, her mother is wealthy, the son is going into a practical field, and the daughter's grad program might be seen as less practical. But he's also given her a car while the son got a game console. The daughter felt disrespected and called him sexist, which led to the argument.\n\nNow, to determine if the father is in the wrong. Legally, he's fulfilling his obligations with child support. However, emotionally and ethically, is he being fair? The daughter might feel that being a parent means contributing equally, but the father is making choices based on financial circumstances and priorities. The daughter's accusation of sexism is problematic, but the father's reasoning might have underlying biases. For example, dismissing her grad school as \"useless\" because of the field could be a bias, and spending more on a car for her than on the son's console might seem unequal. Also, the way he responded to her emotional state could be seen as dismissive.\n\nThe father's argument that he's not a bank and that his money is his own is valid in terms of personal choice, but as a parent, expectations can vary. The daughter's reaction is intense, but the father's justification might not fully address her feelings of being undervalued. The fact that he pays child support but not education might be seen as inconsistent, especially if the daughter is in need. However, the daughter's mother is wealthy, so maybe the father feels it's her responsibility. \n\nThe key question is whether the father's decisions are fair or biased. The mention of the son's practical major versus the daughter's might hint at gender bias, assuming that her field is less valuable. The father's comment about not being a bank and keeping his money might be seen as selfish, but he's also balancing his resources between two different situations. The daughter's outburst was harsh, but the father's response might not have addressed her feelings adequately, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father has valid reasons for his financial decisions, the way he handled the situation and the underlying assumptions (like the value of her chosen field) might contribute to the daughter feeling undervalued. However, the daughter's accusation of sexism and the father's refusal to pay based on financial and practical reasons could both be seen as contributing to the conflict. But in terms of the father's actions, he might not be in the wrong if his decisions are based on his own judgment and resources, even if the daughter is upset. However, there's a possibility of subconscious bias affecting his decisions. The answer could be nuanced, but the question is a yes/no. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but considering all factors, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the father's reasoning shows bias, it could be A. Hmm.\n"
