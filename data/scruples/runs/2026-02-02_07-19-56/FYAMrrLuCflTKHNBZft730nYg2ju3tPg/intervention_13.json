I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The father has a daughter from a one-night stand and a son with his current wife. He pays child support for the daughter and is now being asked by her to contribute to her grad school. He refuses, citing several reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The father argues that he's already contributing significantly through child support, which is a court-mandated amount. He points out that his wife makes very little, while the daughter's mother is financially better off. He's also giving different gifts to each child: a car for the daughter and a console for the son. The daughter feels it's unfair since he's paying for her half-brother's education but not hers, and she's upset about it. She called him sexist, and the conversation ended poorly.\n\nThe key points here are fairness, financial responsibility, and the nature of the parent-child relationship. The daughter is part of his life, and she's expecting some level of financial support, especially since he's paying child support. On the other hand, the father is managing different financial situations with two different families. The child support he's paying is a legal obligation, but does that equate to covering her education? The father's wife can't afford much, so he's helping his son, but the daughter's mother is more financially stable.\n\nThe father's argument that he's already contributing through child support is valid, but maybe he's not considering the daughter's perspective. She might feel that child support is for basic needs, not for education. The father's refusal could be seen as unfair, especially if he's the only parent paying for the son's education. Additionally, the way he ended the conversation was harsh, which might have escalated the situation. The daughter's frustration is understandable, given that she's being asked to pay for grad school in a field he considers \"useless,\" and he's supporting her half-brother without the same conditions.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of equality versus fairness. The father is treating both children differently based on their circumstances, which might be fair in terms of financial capacity, but it's not equal. The daughter might feel that equality is important, even if the situations are different. The father's justification about the mother's income is a factor, but if he's paying child support, he might have a responsibility beyond just that. Also, the fact that he gave a car to the daughter while the son got a console could add to her feeling of being undervalued.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was strong, but she's young and emotional. The father's response was dismissive and could have been more empathetic. His comment about her major being \"useless\" might be a point of contention, as it shows a lack of support for her academic choices, which could contribute to her feeling of being unappreciated.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a push for equal treatment of children, regardless of the parent's relationship status. The father's actions might be seen as favoring his current wife's child over the daughter from a different relationship, even if there are financial reasons. However, the financial disparities between the two families do play a role in his decision-making.\n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? He has valid points about financial constraints and the court-mandated support, but the daughter's feelings of neglect and the potential for unequal treatment are significant. The way he handled the conversation was also poor, contributing to the conflict. While his reasons have merit, the emotional impact and the perception of favoritism might place him in the wrong, at least in terms of the daughter's perspective and the way the situation was managed.\n"
