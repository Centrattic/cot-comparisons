I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a one-night stand 22 years ago and ended up being a father to their daughter. Now, the daughter is about to graduate and wants help with grad school, but the author refuses, explaining several reasons. They also have a son with their current spouse, and they're covering his undergraduate costs. The daughter accused the father of favoring his \"real\" family, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points from the author's reasons include child support payments to the daughter's mother, the difference in school costs between the daughter (private grad school) and son (state school), gifts given to the daughter compared to the son, the daughter's mother's higher income versus the wife's lower income, and the son's practical major versus the daughter's perceived \"useless\" major.\n\nHmm. Let me think about fairness here. The author is a father to both kids, but they were born from different relationships. The daughter comes from a one-night stand, and the son from his current marriage. The author is paying for the son's undergrad, which could be seen as part of their current family responsibilities. The daughter's grad school request is a new expense. \n\nThe author argues that they contribute more through child support, which might be legally mandated, but maybe that's not enough. However, the daughter's mother is financially better off, so maybe the author feels relieved of responsibility. But does that mean the author isn't responsible at all? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe author's reasons for not paying include the cost difference. The daughter's grad school is expensive, while the son's undergrad is cheaper. But the author is paying for the son's education, which could be seen as a choice, while the daughter's grad school is her own decision. However, the author might be setting a precedent by helping the son but not the daughter. Also, the daughter's major is criticized, which could be a bias.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but she might feel unappreciated. The author's response was dismissive, telling her to enjoy the \"real family,\" which could be hurtful. Even if the author has reasons, the way the daughter is treated might be unfair. The author might be showing favoritism unconsciously.\n\nAnother angle: The author is the father regardless of the circumstances. The daughter is also their child. The fact that the author is paying for the son's undergrad but not the daughter's grad school might create a sense of inequality. Even if the reasons are valid, the perception of fairness matters. The daughter might feel that the author is prioritizing their current family over the daughter, even if the author sees it as fulfilling different responsibilities.\n\nThe author's point about child support is a legal obligation, but it's separate from personal contributions. The author might be conflating the two. The daughter's mother's income is higher, but the father's role isn't negated. The author's argument that the son's major is practical versus the daughter's is subjective and might be a way to justify not helping her financially.\n\nThe emotional response from the daughter is significant, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive. The father's statement about the daughter blowing it out of proportion might not acknowledge her feelings of being undervalued. The use of terms like \"sexist\" from the daughter could be an overreaction, but the father's actions might be seen as sexist if he's favoring the son due to being part of his current family.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author has the means to contribute to both, not helping the daughter could be inconsiderate. The author's reasons are based on cost and financial contributions, but the daughter is in a different situation. The author's decision might be practical, but it's possible they are in the wrong because they're not treating both children equally without valid, unbiased reasoning.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the son is part of the current family, and the daughter is from a different context. But as a parent, the author has a responsibility to both. The author's response might be seen as prioritizing their current family, which could be unfair to the daughter.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's decision is based on various justifications, but the way they handle the situation might come off as unfair or biased. The daughter's feelings are valid if she feels neglected, even if the author has reasons. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the emotional impact and not treating both children equitably.\n"
