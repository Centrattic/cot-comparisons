I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The father is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter feels this is unfair, especially since he didn't contribute during her undergraduate years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's reasons. He mentions paying child support that's significant, which is a court-ordered obligation. The daughter's mother has a higher salary, so maybe she's expected to cover the grad school costs. The son's education is more affordable, and he's choosing a practical major, while the daughter's chosen field is seen as less practical. The father also gave the daughter a car, which he didn't do for the son, and his wife's income is low, which might influence his financial decisions.\n\nBut here's the catch: the daughter is an adult now, and the father is paying for her grad school. Some might argue that once a child is an adult, the expectation for parental financial support decreases, especially if the parent didn't contribute to undergraduate. The daughter's reaction is intense, calling him sexist, which he denies. He says he didn't mean to favor the \"real\" family, referring to his wife and son.\n\nThe key points are fairness, consistency, and the daughter's maturity. The father's actions are inconsistent\u2014he gave the daughter a car but not educational support. The daughter might feel that since he didn't help with undergrad, grad school is an extension of that. However, the father uses financial constraints and the daughter's mother's ability to pay as reasons. \n\nIs the father being sexist? The daughter's accusation is serious, but the father's arguments are about financial distribution and the daughter's mother's capacity. However, the phrase \"real family\" might imply a bias towards his own biological child, which could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the father's justification for not helping with undergrad (the daughter's mother's salary) might not absolve him of contributing if he's willing to help the son. \n\nOn the other hand, the father is within his rights to decide how to allocate his money. However, treating children differently can lead to perceptions of unfairness, especially if the reasons aren't clear or consistent. The daughter's emotional reaction is valid given the perceived inconsistency, but the father's response might come across as dismissive, possibly invalidating her feelings.\n\nConsidering all this, the father's actions might be unjust, but it's a nuanced situation. The decision hinges on whether his reasons are justifiable and whether his treatment is fair. The daughter's accusation of sexism is a strong claim, but if the father's reasoning is based on financial and practical considerations rather than gender, he might not be in the wrong. However, the way he communicated his decision and the perceived favoritism could make him the asshole. Given the context, I think the answer is A (in the wrong) because the inconsistency in support and the perception of favoritism, even if unintended, can be hurtful and unfair. The father's arguments about financial contributions might not fully address the daughter's need for equal consideration, especially since she's an adult now.\n"
