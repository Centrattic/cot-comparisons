I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The scenario involves a father who had a one-night stand resulting in a daughter, then later married someone with a son. Now, the daughter is upset because he's helping her half-brother but not her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gave. He mentions legal child support, financial contributions already through support, the daughter's mother having higher income, and the son's practical major vs. the daughter's. He also gave her a car, which might be seen as a financial contribution.\n\nBut on the flip side, the daughter was raised by him and he stepped up as a father. Legally, he might be required to pay the daughter, but emotionally and ethically, does that mean he should also fund her education? The daughter might feel that despite the child support, her father should contribute to her education since he's doing for his son. \n\nThe author's reasoning about the majors and costs could be seen as dismissive of her academic choices. The daughter's frustration could stem from feeling undervalued or that her education isn't as respected. Also, the argument that the mother can afford it might not absolve him of responsibility if he's willing to help the son. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was strong, but the author's response might be seen as not acknowledging her feelings. The fact that he calls her a \"useless\" major is problematic, as it's a judgment on her academic interests. \n\nFinancial disparities between the two kids' educations and the different financial situations of the mothers might be valid points, but there's a fairness issue here. The father is providing for the son's undergrad, which the daughter might see as unequal. Even if the mother can afford it, the father's decision not to help could be perceived as unfair.\n\nThe key points are: Did the father treat the daughter equitably? The argument is that he's contributing more to the daughter in other ways (child support, car), but she's in a different financial situation than the son. However, if he's able to help the son, the daughter might feel entitled to similar support. The father's justification based on the mother's income could be a way to avoid responsibility, especially if he's willing to help the son whose mother is less financially stable.\n\nIn terms of fairness and potential bias, the father's comments about the daughter's major being \"useless\" and his overall treatment might be seen as sexist or dismissive, reinforcing the daughter's feelings of being undervalued. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, even if the father has valid reasons, the perception of favoritism and the way he's handling the daughter's education might make him the asshole in the situation.\n"
