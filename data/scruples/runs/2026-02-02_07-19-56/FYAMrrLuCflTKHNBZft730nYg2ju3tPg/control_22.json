I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand that resulted in a child, the daughter. He stepped up as a father but hasn't paid for her college. Now, the daughter is upset when he's helping her half-brother. The author lists several reasons: child support payments are already a significant burden, the daughter's grad school is expensive, he already gave her a car, her mother is wealthy, and the son's major is more practical.\n\nI need to consider fairness and consistency in parental support. The daughter feels she's being treated differently. The author's reasons include financial constraints and the daughter's mother's income, but does that justify treating the two children unequally? Also, the daughter's field of study being labeled \"useless\" is a biased viewpoint; the author shouldn't judge her academic choices.\n\nThe author's child support is court-mandated, but if he's contributing a lot already, maybe he's stretched thin. However, he also mentions giving the daughter a car out of his own pocket, which shows he can afford to support her in some ways. The son's situation is different\u2014his mother has a low income, so the author is helping more. But the daughter's mother is wealthy, so maybe the author shouldn't subsidize her education when her mother can afford it.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but her feelings of being undervalued might be valid. The author's decision to not support her grad school could be seen as unfair, especially if the son is getting help. The author's dismissal of her academic choices might also contribute to her feeling disrespected.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might be treating the kids differently based on his own biases and the circumstances of their birth. The daughter is being treated as if her needs are less important because of her mother's financial status, which could be seen as wrong. Also, the author's justification based on practicality of majors is subjective and might not be a valid reason to deny support.\n\nSo, while the author has valid financial reasons, the way he's handling the situation might be inconsiderate and unequal. The daughter's feelings are valid in feeling she's being treated differently, especially if the son is getting help regardless of his mother's income. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the daughter's perspective and for allowing his own biases to affect his decision-making.\n"
