I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is a father who had a one-night stand leading to a child, his daughter. He's been paying child support and has been involved in her life. Now, the daughter is asking for help with grad school, but he's paying for his son's undergrad instead. The daughter feels he's being unfair, and he thinks she's overreacting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he gives. He mentions that he's already paying a significant amount in child support, which is mandated by the courts. So, legally, he's already required to contribute to the daughter's upbringing. He also points out that the daughter's mom is financially well-off, whereas his wife, the son's mother, isn't doing as well. That makes sense because child support calculations often consider the income of both parents.\n\nHe also mentions the daughter wants to go to an expensive private school for grad school, while the son is going to a state school. The costs are much higher for the daughter's education. That's a valid point because the financial burden is different. Then there's the part about the car he gave the daughter versus the console for the son. That's a personal choice he made, but maybe he's compensating in other ways.\n\nThe daughter's major is described as \"useless\" by the father, which is a bit judgmental. But the key here is whether his reasons for not funding her grad school are fair. He claims he's not a bank and that his money is his own. However, given that he's already paying child support, which includes educational support, there might be an expectation for him to contribute to higher education as well. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter's mom is financially capable, so maybe the father isn't obligated beyond the child support. The father's argument is that he's already contributing more to the daughter through child support, and he's helping his son because the wife can't afford it. But does that justify not helping with the daughter's grad school? It depends on whether the child support covers those expenses. If the court-ordered child support is meant to cover the child's needs, including education, then maybe he isn't in the wrong. However, if the daughter is now requesting additional support beyond what's already provided, the father has the right to say no.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, calling him a sexist asshole, but her feelings of being less loved because of the financial support might be valid from her perspective. The father might be treating his children differently based on financial situations, which could be seen as unfair, but not necessarily sexist. The term \"real family\" might imply he feels closer to his son's family, but that's his perspective. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical obligations, the father isn't legally required to pay for the daughter's grad school beyond what's in the child support. However, ethically, if both parents can afford it, the daughter might feel entitled to some support. But the father is choosing not to due to various reasons, which he believes are justified. \n\nSo, considering all points, the father's decision isn't necessarily wrong, especially since he's fulfilling his legal obligations. The daughter's hurt feelings are real, but the father's financial decisions are based on existing commitments and other factors. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any bias or unfairness in his reasoning. The mention of the daughter's major as \"useless\" could be a personal bias, but that's part of his reasoning. However, the core issue is financial responsibility, and he's not obligated to cover that unless the court orders it. So, B seems correct.\n"
