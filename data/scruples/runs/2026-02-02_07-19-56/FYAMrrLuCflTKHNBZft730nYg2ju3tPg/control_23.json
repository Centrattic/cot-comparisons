I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who's paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter is upset about this and called him a sexist asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the father gives. He mentions child support that's already a significant amount, the daughter's mother having a high income and the son's mother a low income. Also, the daughter went to an expensive private school, and the son is going to a state school. The father argues that he's already contributing through child support and that the daughter's mother can afford her education. Plus, the daughter's field of study is seen as impractical.\n\nBut wait, the key points here are fairness between children. Even if the daughter's mother is wealthy, the father is the biological parent, and he's making a decision that affects his daughter. The fact that he pays child support might cover some costs, but does that justify not contributing to her education? There's also the issue of treating children differently based on their parents' income, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nMoreover, the daughter's reaction was intense, calling him sexist, which the father might not have intended. The father's argument about the daughter's major being \"useless\" is problematic because it's a subjective judgment. Different fields have different value, and it's not fair to dismiss someone's academic interests based on perceived practicality.\n\nThe father's reasoning about financial contributions: he spends more on the daughter through child support, but the daughter is now seeking additional support for grad school. The fact that the son's education is cheaper and the daughter's is more expensive might be a factor, but the principle of equal parental support for both children could come into play here. The daughter might feel that despite the father's contributions, he's not treating her as an equal, especially if he's contributing to the son's education.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the father's treatment of the daughter. He sent her a car with his own money, which is generous, but that doesn't necessarily equate to educational support. The daughter might see education as a key investment and feel that her father is not supporting her in the same way as her half-brother.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional response. The father said he told the daughter he wasn't a bank and that his money is his. That could be seen as dismissive, especially if the daughter feels it's a matter of support, not just money. The father's reaction to her anger by saying to talk later when she's less emotional might have been perceived as invalidating her feelings.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might argue that a parent should support all their children equally regardless of their parents' income, but others would say it's reasonable to consider each child's financial situation. However, the daughter's mother being able to afford her education doesn't negate the daughter's desire for her father's support. The father's refusal might be seen as not acknowledging his responsibility beyond child support.\n\nThe daughter's accusation of sexism is a serious one. Even if the father didn't mean it that way, treating children differently based on gender or other factors could be problematic. The fact that the son is a \"real\" family member (his wife's child) versus the daughter from a one-night stand might unconsciously influence his decisions, leading to perceived favoritism.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father has valid financial reasons and the daughter's mother can afford her education, the father's decision to not support his daughter's grad school and the way he communicated it could be seen as unfair and dismissive. The key issue is whether he's treating both children equitably, considering their different circumstances. The daughter's emotional response and the father's condescending attitude towards her field of study likely contribute to the perception that he's in the wrong.\n"
