I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a father who is paying for his son's undergraduate education but refusing to help his daughter with graduate school. The key points are the reasons he lists for not contributing to her education.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand and didn't want to be a father but stepped up. He pays child support for the daughter, which is significant because of his income. The daughter is now in her final year of undergrad and wants grad school, while the son is going to a state school. The father argues that he's already contributing more via child support and that the daughter's mother can afford it. \n\nLooking at the reasons he gave: 1) Child support is already a legal obligation, which might imply he's already contributing more than he feels comfortable with. 2) The cost difference between grad school and undergrad for the son. 3) He bought her a car, which he didn't do for the son. 4) The daughter's mother has a higher income. 5) The son's major is practical, while the daughter's is considered less so.\n\nThe daughter felt disrespected and accused him of caring more about his \"real\" family. The father's response was to say she's being disrespectful and not to take it that way. \n\nNow, considering fairness and parental responsibility: The father is legally obligated to support the daughter, but the question is about paying for education beyond what child support covers. Child support is meant for basic needs, not necessarily education. If the father can afford to pay for his son's education, why not the daughter's? However, the daughter is an adult now, and grad school is a personal choice. The father might feel it's her responsibility to fund it, especially if she's financially supported by her mother. \n\nBut there's a double standard here. He gave the daughter a car out of his own pocket, while giving the son less. If he's willing to spend $12k on a car for the daughter, why not contribute to grad school? Also, the argument about the majors being \"useless\" could be problematic, implying bias. The daughter's field might be less lucrative, but that doesn't mean it's without value. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but the father's reasons for not helping might come across as unfair. The key issue is treating both children equally. Even if the mother can afford it, the father's contribution could be seen as partial support. By not offering any help, he's not showing the same level of support as for the son. \n\nThe father's justification about child support being a significant amount might be valid, but if he's paying more in support than the son's mother, he might still have the means to help with grad school. The fact that he paid for the car shows he can give gifts, so why not education? It seems like he's being inconsistent. \n\nAdditionally, calling the daughter a \"sexist asshole\" when she accused him of favoring his real family adds insult to injury. His response was dismissive, which could have made her feel undervalued. \n\nIn summary, while the daughter's reaction was extreme, the father's decision to support the son but not the daughter might be seen as unfair. He's not accounting for the daughter's efforts and the fact that she's already received significant support. The double standard here is problematic, making him the asshole. Answer A.\n"
