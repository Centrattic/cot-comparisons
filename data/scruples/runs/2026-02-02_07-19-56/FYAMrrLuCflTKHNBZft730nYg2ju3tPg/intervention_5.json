I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for paying their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. Let me read through the details again.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand that led to a child, their daughter. They stepped up to be a father. Now, the daughter is asking for help with grad school, while the author is paying for their son's undergrad. The daughter gets angry, accusing the father of caring more about his \"real\" family. The author lists several reasons, like child support, the cost difference, previous gifts (car vs. console), the mother's financial situation, and the son's practical major versus the daughter's \"useless\" one.\n\nSo, the key points here. The father is paying for the son's education, which is less expensive, and the daughter is going for a more expensive grad program. The father's reasoning includes financial obligations (child support) and the mother's income. But there's also the part where he says the daughter's major is \"useless,\" which sounds like a bias. Also, he mentions not paying for her undergrad at all, just a car. The daughter's mom makes more money, so maybe the father feels less obligated, but he's paying for the son's school despite his wife's low income.\n\nIs the father in the wrong? Well, treating children differently can be seen as unfair. The daughter might feel neglected, especially if the father is paying for the son but not contributing to her undergrad. The father's reasons include financial obligations, but maybe he's also being influenced by the type of majors or the relationship with the mothers. The comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" is problematic, showing a lack of support. Also, the father's response when the daughter got angry was to tell her to calm down, which isn't addressing the issue. The daughter's emotional reaction is valid if she feels undervalued. The father might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and for the biased comments about her education choice. The financial reasons are there, but the way he justifies it by calling her major useless adds to the problem. So, probably the answer is yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
