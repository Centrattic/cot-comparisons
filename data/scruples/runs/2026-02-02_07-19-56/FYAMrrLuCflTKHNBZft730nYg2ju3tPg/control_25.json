I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the father is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter feels this is unfair and called him sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the reasons he gave. He mentions that he pays child support for his daughter, which is court-mandated and a significant amount. He argues that he's already contributing more to her through child support than to his son. Also, the daughter wants to attend a private, expensive grad school, while the son is going to a state school. He also gave her a car with his own money, while the son got a video game. The daughter's mom is wealthy, whereas the son's mother isn't doing well financially. Plus, the son is in a practical major, and the daughter's is deemed \"useless.\"\n\nHmm. The father is splitting the payments based on different factors like his financial obligations, the schools' costs, and the children's choices. But is that fair? He's using different standards for each child, which might be part of the issue. The daughter might feel that her educational goals are being devalued because of their perceived \"uselessness,\" which could be a biased view. Also, the fact that he's giving different gifts might contribute to her feeling of being treated differently.\n\nThe father's argument about child support is a point in his favor, but child support is a legal obligation, not necessarily a voluntary contribution towards education. So, expecting the daughter to cover her own graduate school costs when he's helping her son might be seen as unfair, especially if the son's education is cheaper. However, the father is also considering the financial situations of the two mothers, which complicates things. The daughter's mother is wealthier, so maybe the father isn't as responsible for her education. But maybe the daughter expects him to contribute regardless.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was emotional, but that doesn't mean she's wrong. However, his response that he's not a bank and that he's been a good father might not address her feelings of being treated differently. The fact that he called her a \"sexist asshole\" in anger might have escalated the situation, but the underlying issue is whether his treatment is fair.\n\nI think the key points are the differing financial contributions based on the children's circumstances and the father's reasoning. If the daughter's mother is financially capable, the father's obligation might be less. However, the daughter might still feel entitled because he's helping the son. The father's justification about the child support and the son's mother's financial situation might be valid, but his decision to not help the daughter despite already supporting her with a car could be seen as inconsistent. The difference in how he treats the two children's educational choices (practical vs. \"useless\") is a bit problematic because it's making value judgments on their academic paths.\n\nIn conclusion, the father might not be entirely in the wrong, but there are aspects of his reasoning that could be seen as unfair or biased. The daughter's feelings are valid, and the father's handling of the situation, including his dismissive comments, might have contributed to the conflict. However, the financial realities and the legal obligations also play a role. It's a complex situation, but I think the answer leans towards the father not being in the wrong because he has valid reasons, even if the daughter feels wronged.\n"
