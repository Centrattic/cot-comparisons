I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a father who's paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter is upset, thinking he cares more about his \"real\" family (his son and his wife) than her. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the reasons he gives. He mentions child support which is court-ordered and higher for the daughter. The daughter wants to go to an expensive private grad school, while the son is going to a cheaper state school. He also gave her a car, and her mom is wealthy, whereas his wife (son's mom) isn't. Plus, the son's major is practical, and the daughter's is considered less so.\n\nHmm. The father's reasoning seems to be based on financial circumstances and the court's decision. He's paying child support for the daughter, which is a legal obligation, but he's not using that money for her education. He's also comparing the financial situations of the two mothers. However, the daughter feels he's treating her differently. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, even if the child support is higher, if he's choosing to pay for his son's undergrad but not the daughter's grad school, that could be seen as unequal treatment. The daughter might feel that since he's contributing to the son's education, she should also be eligible. The fact that the daughter's mom is wealthy and the son's mom isn't adds another layer. But the father is using that as a reason to not help the daughter, which could be seen as unfair because the daughter is asking for help despite her mom's ability to pay. \n\nAlso, the father's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" might come across as dismissive and could be a point of contention. His reaction to her anger, telling her to \"fuck off\" and calling her a sexist asshole is problematic. Even if he didn't mean it, the way he responded could be seen as invalidating her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, he's a civil engineer with a decent salary and might be managing his resources based on what he thinks is fair. But the issue is whether his actions are discriminatory. The daughter is his child regardless of the circumstances of her birth. The fact that he had a one-night stand and stepped up as a father is commendable, but treating her differently because she's from a different mother could be seen as unfair.\n\nThe daughter is also about to go to grad school, which is a significant financial commitment. If the father is willing to pay for his son's undergrad, which is cheaper, but not the daughter's more expensive grad school, that could be seen as inconsistent. The daughter's argument is that since he's helping the son, she should be helped too. The father's reasoning about the different financial situations of the mothers might not be a valid reason to treat the children differently. It's the child's right to expect support from both parents, regardless of the parents' financial status. \n\nThe father's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" shows a bias towards practical fields, which might not be fair. The daughter's interests and her chosen field shouldn't be judged by him. Also, the fact that he gave her a car while the son got a game console might contribute to the daughter feeling less supported. \n\nIn terms of the response to her anger, the father could have handled it better. Saying \"enjoy your real family\" and then getting called a sexist asshole indicates that there's a communication issue here. The father might not realize how his actions and words are perceived by the daughter. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the father's actions and reasoning might be seen as unfair and discriminatory. He's treating the two children differently based on their mothers' financial situations and the children's choices, which could be considered as the father being in the wrong. Even if he has his reasons, the daughter's feelings of being less valued are valid, and the father should consider his role as a parent to both children equally.\n"
