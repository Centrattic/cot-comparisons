I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. \n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and the woman got pregnant. He didn't want the baby, but she did, so he became a father. Now the daughter is upset because he's helping his son with college but not her grad school. The author lists reasons: child support payments are already a significant amount, the daughter's school is expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom is wealthy, and her major isn't practical. He also mentions that he's not a bank and his money is his own.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are fairness between children, the legal obligation of child support, and the daughter's reaction. The author is paying child support, which is a court-mandated payment, so he's already contributing to his daughter's upbringing. However, choosing to pay for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school might be seen as unequal treatment. \n\nBut there are other factors. The daughter's mother is financially stable, while the son's mother is not. The author is covering his son's education because his wife can't afford it. The daughter, on the other hand, has a wealthy mother who is presumably able to cover her education. The author also gave the daughter a car, which was a personal expense, so maybe he's already invested in her. The daughter's choice of graduate program might be a concern for him, but that's his personal opinion. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, calling him a sexist asshole. The author's refusal might be justified because of the financial contributions he's already making and the different financial situations of the two mothers. However, the fact that he's prioritizing his son's education over his daughter's could be seen as unfair, especially since he's the father to both. But considering the legal obligations and the different circumstances of each child's family, perhaps it's not entirely his fault. \n\nAlso, the daughter's accusation that he cares more about his \"real\" family is a sensitive point. Even if the author considers the daughter his child, the fact that the son is with his wife might influence his decisions. But legally and morally, he is the father to both. The main issue is whether it's fair to pay for one but not the other when the daughter's mother can afford it. \n\nIn the end, the author's reasons are valid based on financial contexts, but the way he's treating his children differently could be seen as unfair. However, since he's already contributing through child support and the daughter's mother is financially capable, maybe he isn't in the wrong. The daughter's overreaction might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), because the author has legitimate reasons based on financial obligations and the daughter's mother's ability to pay. But some might argue that as a father, he should treat both children equally. However, the legal and financial context complicates this. So I think the answer is B.\n"
