I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and the woman ended up pregnant. He stepped up as a father, so he's the dad to the daughter. Now, he's also married to the mother of his son. The daughter is about to finish undergrad and wants grad school help, but he's not paying, while he is paying for his son's undergrad. The daughter is upset, calling him sexist, etc.\n\nHe lists reasons: he pays child support for the daughter, which is significant. His son is going to a cheaper school, and he gave the daughter a car, while the son gets a console. The daughter's mom is wealthy, while the son's mom is on a low income. The son's major is practical, the daughter's is considered \"useless\" (like gender studies maybe). He says he's not a bank and the money is his. The daughter is angry, called him names.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong. Let's think about fairness and parental responsibility. The daughter is his child, and he's a parent. Even if he's paying child support, maybe he's still responsible for her education. The child support is a legal obligation, but does that cover education? The mother is wealthy, but maybe the father still has a say or responsibility. He's giving different things (car vs. console), but when it comes to education, he's paying for the son but not the daughter. That seems unequal. \n\nHe argues that the daughter's major is \"useless\"\u2014that's a problematic attitude. Assuming one field is less valuable than another can be sexist or biased. Also, he's using the fact that the daughter's mom is wealthy, but maybe he's still expected to contribute if he can. He's a civil engineer with a decent salary. The daughter feels he's favoring his \"real\" family, implying the son is his biological child while the daughter is not. That could be a factor in the daughter's feelings of being less valued. \n\nThe daughter's reaction is extreme, but her perception of being treated unfairly might have some basis. The father's reasons include financial calculations, but maybe he's not considering that as a parent, he should treat both children equitably regardless of circumstances. The fact that he gives different gifts (car vs. games) might not matter as much as the educational support. \n\nAlso, the daughter is in grad school, which is a further investment. The son is in undergrad, but the cost difference is significant. The father might be trying to balance finances, but the daughter feels it's unfair. The key points here are whether parental financial support should be equal regardless of the child's circumstances, and if the father's justifications are valid. \n\nThe father's argument that the daughter's mother is wealthy is a point, but maybe the father still has a responsibility to support both children. The fact that he's paying child support doesn't necessarily absolve him from contributing to her education if he's able. Also, his comment about the \"useless\" major is discriminatory and could be part of why the daughter feels he's not supporting her. \n\nIn terms of equality, if he's paying for one child's education but not the other, even if there are financial reasons, it might be seen as unfair. The daughter's emotional reaction, while strong, could stem from feeling that she's being treated differently. The father's response of not wanting to be a bank might be his way of setting boundaries, but if he can afford to help, maybe he should. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the father's actions might be seen as unfair. He's providing unequal support to his two children, and his reasons might be influenced by biases (like the major being \"useless\") and financial calculations that don't account for the emotional impact on the daughter. The fact that he's not the daughter's biological parent (though he's accepted the role) might also play into the daughter's feelings of being less valued. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not treating his children equitably and his justifications include biased reasoning.
