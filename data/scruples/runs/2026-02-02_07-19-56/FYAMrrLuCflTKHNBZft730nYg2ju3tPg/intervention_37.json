I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school, and the daughter feels he's showing favoritism.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand that resulted in a daughter. He stepped up to be a father, which is commendable. Now, the daughter is upset because he's helping her younger half-brother with college but not her grad school. The father lists several reasons: he pays child support which is a significant amount, the son is going to a cheaper school, he already gave the daughter a car, her mother can afford, and the son's major is more practical.\n\nI need to consider the fairness here. The father is paying child support, which is legally mandated, so maybe the daughter feels he's contributing enough through that. But the daughter is asking for additional help beyond child support for grad school. However, the father is not obligated to pay for her education beyond what's in the child support. The key point is whether it's fair to expect him to pay for her grad school when he's not doing the same for his son, especially considering the financial differences in their schools and the parents' income levels.\n\nThe father's reasons seem logical. The son's education is cheaper, and the daughter's mother is financially stable. The father's wife isn't making much, so he's helping the son. The daughter's reaction, calling him a sexist asshole, might be an overreaction, but the father's refusal could also be seen as favoritism. However, the father is providing for the daughter in other ways (the car), and the child support is already a substantial contribution. \n\nThe daughter might feel entitled because the father is present in her life and supports her in other ways. But legally and traditionally, child support is the main obligation for non-custodial parents. The father isn't legally required to pay for college or grad school unless specified in the child support agreement. Since the daughter's mother is capable of funding her education, the father isn't obligated to cover it. \n\nThe father's decision to prioritize the son's more practical and less expensive major could be seen as a sound financial choice. However, treating the daughter differently might lead to feelings of unfairness. But given the financial realities and the daughter's mother's ability to contribute, the father's stance is defensible.\n\nSo, considering all points, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the father isn't legally obligated to pay for the daughter's grad school, and his reasons are based on financial prudence and existing support. However, the emotional impact on the daughter is real, and the father might need to address that to maintain a good relationship.\n"
