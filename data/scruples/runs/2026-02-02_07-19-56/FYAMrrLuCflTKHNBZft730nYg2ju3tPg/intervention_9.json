I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. \n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand and became a parent to the daughter. He's been paying child support since, which the courts required, and he's contributing a significant amount. The daughter is now asking for help with grad school, which the father refuses. The son is from his current marriage, and he's paying for his undergrad.\n\nLooking at the reasons the father gives: he's already paying child support, the daughter's school is expensive, he bought her a car, her mom is wealthy, and her major isn't practical. But wait, the father is paying for the daughter's child support, which is already a financial obligation. The son's mother is less financially stable. The daughter's mom can afford it, which is a key point. \n\nThe daughter felt slighted and called him a sexist, which the father denies. The question is whether his decision is fair. \n\nHe's using different criteria for each child. The daughter's grad school is more expensive, but he's also considering the practicality of the major. However, it's her choice to go into that field. Also, he provided a car initially, which might not compare to the son's console, but the son's mother isn't contributing much. \n\nBut the father is paying for the son's education, which the daughter perceives as favoritism. Even though there are financial reasons, treating children differently based on their parentage might be seen as unfair. The daughter might feel that since he's a father to both, he should support both equally. \n\nThe father's argument is about financial contributions already made via child support and the different circumstances of each child's family. But the daughter's feeling of being less valued is real. The father might not be wrong in a legal or financial sense, but emotionally, he may have failed to consider her feelings. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's following his reasoning, but treating children the same when their situations are different can lead to perceived unfairness. The daughter's reaction is strong, but the father's decision has valid points. However, the way the father framed his decision might come across as dismissive of her needs, especially when he mentions the major being \"useless\" which could be disrespectful. \n\nOverall, while there are valid financial arguments, the father's approach might be in the wrong because he's not treating his daughter as an equal in terms of support despite different family circumstances. The daughter's perspective is that he's favoring his \"real\" family, which he should address more sensitively.\n"
