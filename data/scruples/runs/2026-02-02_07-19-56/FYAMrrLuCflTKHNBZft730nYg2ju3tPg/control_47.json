I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The author has a one-night stand that resulted in a daughter, and now he's also paying for his son from his current marriage.\n\nFirst, the author is paying child support for his daughter, which is court-ordered and significant. He's also given her a car, while the son gets a game console. The daughter's mom earns a high salary, so she can afford her education. The son's mom has a low income, so the author helps with his college. The daughter is now in grad school, which is expensive, and she's upset he isn't contributing. The author argues practicality: son's major is CS, daughter's is something considered less practical. He feels he's already contributing more through child support and other gifts.\n\nThe daughter called him sexist, but he didn't want to pay for her grad school. The key points here are about fairness and the reasons provided. The author's reasons include financial responsibility, the different financial situations of the two mothers, and the practicality of the majors. However, the daughter might feel that since he's paying for the son's undergrad, he should also cover her grad school, regardless of the reasons. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's using the law (child support) to justify not paying further, but the daughter might see it as unequal treatment. Also, the argument about practical majors could be seen as biased. The author's actions might be fair in terms of financial capability, but the emotional aspect is tricky. He's treating the two children differently, which the daughter feels is unfair. The daughter's mom is financially better off, so maybe the author isn't obligated, but the daughter might still expect support. The author's response to her anger might have been dismissive. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, it's about intent and fairness. The author has his reasons, but the daughter's feelings matter. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because he's following his reasoning and legal obligations, but others might see it as unfair. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given the context, the author's reasons are valid in his perspective, so the answer is B.\n"
