I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The father had a one-night stand that resulted in the daughter, and he's been paying child support. The daughter is upset because she feels he's not supporting her, especially since he's helping his son. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he gives. He mentions child support already covering a significant portion for the daughter. He's also paying for the son's state school, which is cheaper. He gave the daughter a car, while the son got a game console. The daughter's mother is wealthier, while the son's mother has a lower income. The son is in a practical major, and the daughter's field is considered \"useless\" by the father.\n\nHe argues that he's not a bank and that his money is his own. The daughter accused him of sexist behavior because he's paying for the son but not her. He felt the conversation was disrespectful, leading to a heated argument.\n\nNow, considering fairness and equality. Even though the daughter's mother earns more, the father has already been paying child support, which is a legal obligation. But the daughter is now going to grad school, which isn't covered by child support. The father might feel that since the mother can afford it, he shouldn't have to. However, treating children equally is important. The son is his biological child, but the daughter is also his child. The father's decision to pay for the son but not the daughter might be seen as unfair, especially if he's contributing beyond child support in other ways (like the car) but not for the son.\n\nThe daughter's field of study is a point he brings up, but it's problematic to judge someone's educational choices as \"useless.\" That could be a bias, and educational value is subjective. Also, the father's reaction to her outburst\u2014saying they can talk when she's less emotional\u2014might come off as dismissive. The daughter's feeling of being less loved is hurtful, and the father's justification based on income and support from each parent's spouse could be seen as reasonable in some contexts but not others.\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's not in the wrong morally. The key issue is whether he's treating both children equally. If he's providing different levels of support without a valid reason, that could be discriminatory. However, the financial realities and the different circumstances (like the mother's ability to pay) might mitigate some of the blame. But the fact that he's making value judgments about the daughter's major and the emotional response suggests potential bias.\n\nIn conclusion, the father's actions might be seen as unfair because he's providing different support levels without a clear justification beyond personal biases. The daughter's feelings of being less valued are valid, and the father's dismissive response doesn't help. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, considering the daughter's mother is financially capable, maybe the father isn't entirely in the wrong. But the emotional impact and the bias in judgment about the major are points against him. It's a bit tricky, but I think the father's decision to pay the son but not the daughter, especially without clear objective reasons beyond personal opinion, makes him at least partially in the wrong. But since the daughter's mother is responsible for her education, maybe he's justified. Wait, but the father has a choice to contribute beyond child support. The fact that he's contributing to the son but not the daughter, despite the daughter's mother being able to pay, might still be seen as a choice that's unfair. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
