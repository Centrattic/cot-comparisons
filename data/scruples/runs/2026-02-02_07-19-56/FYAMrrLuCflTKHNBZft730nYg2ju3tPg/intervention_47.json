I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The situation involves a one-night stand leading to a daughter, and now the daughter is upset because the father isn't contributing to her grad school while he's paying for his son's undergrad.\n\nFirst, the father claims he pays child support, which is significant, and he's not the biological father of the son. The daughter's mother is wealthier, while his wife (the son's mom) has a low income. The daughter is going to an expensive grad program, and the father is comparing it to his son's state school. Also, there's a mention of the daughter getting a car and the son getting a game console. The father argues that his money is his own and he's not a bank.\n\nThe daughter is upset, calling him sexist, and he's defensive, saying he's not the wrong one here. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. \n\nNow, considering family dynamics and fairness: The daughter feels entitled to financial support because she's his child. The father, however, has different circumstances with each child. Legally, he's required to pay child support for the daughter, so maybe he's already meeting that obligation. But financially supporting one child over another can be seen as unfair, regardless of biological ties. The father's reasons include the mother's higher income for the daughter, but if the father has the means, the perception might still be that he's treating the kids differently. Also, the daughter's reaction is intense, but the father's response could be seen as dismissive.\n\nThe father's justification about the son's practical major versus the daughter's \"useless\" one is problematic, as it's judgmental and discriminatory. That could contribute to the daughter feeling undervalued. The father's admission that he's paying more in child support but not helping with education might be seen as inconsistent. The key here is whether the father is being fair in his distribution of resources despite different circumstances.\n\nIn terms of fairness, even if there are valid reasons, the perception of favoritism can hurt the child. The daughter might feel unloved or less valued because she's not receiving the same support. The father's use of terms like \"useless\" for the daughter's major is particularly harmful and could be a sign of bias. \n\nSo, while the father has reasons, the way he's handling it might be seen as inconsiderate or even sexist, especially given the daughter's perspective. The daughter's anger is understandable, but the father's response was dismissive. The father might not be in the legal or strict ethical wrong, but from an emotional and relational perspective, he's contributing to a sense of inequality. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering the emotional impact and is making judgmental statements about the daughter's major, which undermines her feelings and choices.\n"
