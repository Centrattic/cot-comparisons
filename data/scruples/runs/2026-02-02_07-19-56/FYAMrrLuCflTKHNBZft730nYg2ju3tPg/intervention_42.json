I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and the mother didn't want an abortion. He stepped up to be a father. Now the daughter is upset because he's helping her half-brother but not her. The author lists reasons: child support already covers a lot, the daughter wants an expensive school, he already gave her a car, her mom is wealthy, and her major is considered less practical. \n\nHmm. The key points here are fairness and the author's reasons. He's paying for the son's undergrad but not the daughter's grad school. The daughter feels he favors his real family. The author argues that he's already contributing through child support, which is higher due to his salary. Also, he gave her a car, and her mom can afford her education. \n\nI need to consider if these reasons are valid. The author is a civil engineer with a decent salary, but he's paying significant child support. The daughter's mom is wealthy, so maybe she should support her education. The son's mother has a low income, so the author is helping the son. The author might feel it's fair to support the financially disadvantaged son. However, the daughter might see this as unequal treatment. \n\nThe author's reasoning could be seen as justifiable because he's already contributing significantly through child support and the son is in a more financially disadvantaged position. However, the way the author handled the conversation, especially the daughter's emotional reaction and the harsh response, might affect how it's viewed. The daughter might feel unappreciated, especially if the author's support is based on financial considerations rather than equal love. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The reasons given do have merit, especially the financial contributions and the income disparities between the two families. The author isn't obligated to pay for both children's education, especially if the daughter's mother can afford it. However, the daughter might feel it's unfair, but the author's stance could be seen as reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because his reasons are based on financial realities and existing support structures. However, the emotional aspect is tricky. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about fairness per se. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical, just making a judgment call based on his resources and situation.\n"
