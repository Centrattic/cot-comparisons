I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school, even though the daughter is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the context: The author had a one-night stand and ended up with a daughter from that encounter. He's been paying child support, which is court-mandated. Now the daughter is asking for help with grad school, which he's refusing. He lists several reasons: the child support is a significant payment, the daughter's school is expensive, he already gave her a car, the son's mom has a lower income, and the son's major is practical versus the daughter's field which he considers \"useless.\"\n\nThe key points to consider here are fairness, financial responsibility, and parental treatment. The author is paying child support, which is legally required, but the daughter is asking for additional financial support beyond that. The author's arguments are about financial capacity, the differing financial situations of the two mothers, and the choice of fields of study. However, the daughter might feel that since the author is paying for his other child's education, he should also cover hers, especially since he's the father.\n\nPotential issues with the author's position: \n1. **Double Standard**: He's providing support to his son's education but not his daughter's, even though he's already contributing child support. The daughter might perceive this as unequal treatment.\n2. **Financial Priorities**: The author mentions the daughter's field of study as \"useless,\" which could be a biased view. The value of education isn't solely determined by immediate job marketability, and judging the daughter's choices might be unfair.\n3. **Emotional Impact**: The daughter's reaction, while perhaps over the top, indicates that she feels neglected or undervalued. The author's response might be dismissive of her feelings, leading to the conflict.\n4. **Child Support vs. Additional Support**: The court-ordered child support is different from voluntary educational support. The daughter is asking for more than what's legally required, and the author is within his rights to refuse, but the way he's framing it could be seen as justifying unequal treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid points about financial constraints, the differing financial situations of the two mothers, and his own contributions (like the car). However, the core issue is whether he's treating his children fairly. By not providing the same level of financial support to his daughter as he does his son, especially when he's able to, it might be seen as unfair. The daughter's field of study shouldn't be a factor in determining parental support. Also, the author's comments about the daughter's choice of major could be seen as undermining her decisions, which is not supportive.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, parents are often expected to support all their children equally, regardless of circumstances. The author's actions might be seen as prioritizing his \"real\" family (his wife and son) over the daughter from the one-night stand, which adds another layer of complexity. Even if the daughter isn't his legal responsibility in terms of education, he chose to be a father figure, so providing equal support could be expected.\n\nThe daughter's anger and the author's defensive response contribute to the conflict. The author's response might not have adequately addressed her feelings, leading her to feel dismissed. While he's not obligated to pay for her grad school, the way he's handling it could be seen as inconsiderate and contributing to the breakdown in communication.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has his reasons, the unequal treatment based on gender, field of study, and the emotional impact on the daughter suggest that he might be in the wrong. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong), but there are nuances where his financial arguments have merit. However, the overall fairness and support towards all children are compromised.\n"
