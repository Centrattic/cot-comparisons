I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who is paying for his son's college but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter is upset about this and accused him of favoring his \"real\" family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a one-night stand and ended up becoming a father to his daughter. He's been paying child support, which the courts determined as significant. He also gave her a car, which was a big expense. Now, the daughter is asking for help with grad school, but he's not willing. The son is going to a state school, which is cheaper. The author's wife has a low income, while the daughter's mom is well-off.\n\nThe key points to consider are fairness, intent, and the daughter's reaction. The author argues that he's contributing more through child support, the daughter's mom can afford to pay, and the son's path is more practical. However, treating children differently based on parental relationships or financial situations can be seen as unfair. The daughter might feel like she's being treated as less important or not a \"real\" child. Also, the author's comment about her major being \"useless\" is problematic and could come off as dismissive. The daughter's anger and the harsh language she used might be a reaction to feeling undervalued. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's intentions. He's trying to be a responsible father, providing financially in different ways. The child support is court-mandated, and there's a real financial disparity between the two families. The son's education is more affordable, so the father's support there is less of a burden. \n\nHowever, the issue is whether it's fair to pay for one child's education but not the other, especially when both are his children. The daughter isn't asking for the same as her brother, just some help with grad school. The author's reasons are practical, but they might not address the emotional impact. The question is if the father is in the wrong for not contributing, given his justifications. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, parents often face dilemmas about financial support for children. If the father is able to afford helping both, then not doing so might be seen as unfair. However, if there are valid reasons like income disparities and the child's ability (or inability) to afford their education, it might be more justifiable. The key here is whether the father's actions were reasonable and respectful. The daughter's accusation of sexism is a bit off because it's about gender, but the father's own children's situations are different. Still, treating one child differently can be hurtful regardless of the reason. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether his justifications are seen as valid. If the court-mandated support and the daughter's mother's financial ability are taken into account, maybe not. But the way he dismissed the daughter's grad school (calling the major useless) and the differential treatment could be seen as unfair. The daughter's strong reaction might be justified if she feels unappreciated. Therefore, the author might not be the asshole, but there are elements where he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), as he has reasons, though the communication could be improved.\n"
