I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who is paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school, and the daughter is upset about it. \n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand and the daughter is the result of that. He took responsibility by being a father. Now, the daughter is about to go to grad school and is asking for financial help, which he's refusing. The arguments he gives include child support payments, the cost difference between his son's state school and her private grad program, the car he bought her versus a game console for the son, the mother's income versus his wife's, and the son's practical major versus the daughter's more \"useless\" one.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's look at the key points.\n\n1. **Child Support vs. Direct Payments**: The father is paying child support, which is court-mandated. But is that enough? He's contributing more to the daughter's upbringing through support, yet not paying for her education. The daughter might feel that child support is for basic needs, not education, so she's asking for more. The father might think child support covers everything, but maybe it doesn't.\n\n2. **Financial Disparity**: The daughter's grad school is expensive, but her mom earns a high salary. The father argues she can afford it. However, he's paying for his son, whose mother has a lower income. This could be seen as unequal treatment. The father might see it as supporting the lower-income family, but the daughter could feel he's favoring his biological son.\n\n3. **Personal Gifts vs. Educational Support**: The car for the daughter and games for the son show different levels of personal spending. But education is different from personal gifts. The daughter might feel he's not investing in her future, while the son gets more educational support.\n\n4. **Academic Majors**: The father's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" is problematic. It's a judgment that could affect her self-esteem and is a reason not to support her education. This is a clear bias and could be seen as sexist, especially if he's dismissing her academic choices.\n\n5. **Communication Issues**: The daughter's emotional reaction and the father's response (\"enjoy your real family\") might indicate deeper issues. The father's refusal to pay for grad school could make the daughter feel like a less important child. Even if the father has financial reasons, the way he handles the conversation matters.\n\n6. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: While he's not legally required to pay for her education beyond child support, ethically, treating children differently based on biological ties or gender could be seen as unfair. The daughter was not his choice, but he chose to be a father. Consistency in support could be important for her self-worth.\n\n7. **Respect and Communication**: The father's statement that the daughter blew things out of proportion and his dismissive attitude when she's upset might hurt her feelings. The daughter's anger is valid if she feels neglected or less loved. His justification based on salary and major might be rationalizations for unequal treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father has valid points about financial differences and child support, the way he's handling the situation and the reasons he gives (like the major being useless) could be seen as sexist and unfair. The daughter's reaction, though emotional, might stem from feeling undervalued. The father's actions might not be outright wrong in a legal sense, but ethically, he's showing inconsistency and possible bias, which could make him the asshole.\n"
