I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who pays for his son's undergraduate education but refuses to pay for his daughter's graduate school. He explains reasons like child support, different school costs, gifts given to the daughter, the mother's financial situation, and the choice of majors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The father had a one-night stand leading to his daughter's birth. He's been paying child support, which he finds significant. The daughter is now asking for help with grad school, which the father's son isn't getting. The father lists several reasons, including financial disparity between the two families, the daughter's choice of a \"useless\" major, and personal gifts he's given to the daughter versus the son.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants confirmation. Let me analyze each point. The father is a civil engineer with a decent salary. He pays child support to the daughter's mother, which he can't change, and he's also helping his son's family, where the mother has a low income. The daughter's mother is wealthy. The father's son is going to a state school, which is cheaper. The daughter chose a private grad program, which is more expensive. The father gave the daughter a car, while the son got a game console. The daughter is in a major the father deems impractical, which might influence his decision.\n\nThe main issue is the discrepancy in financial support between the two children. The father's arguments include financial obligations (child support), the daughter's mother's ability to pay, and the different financial situations of the two families. However, the daughter feels this is discriminatory. The father's reasoning might be seen as justifying unequal treatment based on circumstances, which can be subjective. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? From a fairness perspective, if the daughter's mother is financially capable, maybe the father isn't obligated. However, treating children differently based on their parents' income or their chosen fields could be seen as unfair. Also, the daughter might feel unappreciated if the father's support is conditional on her choices. The father's comments about the major being \"useless\" might come off as dismissive, which could hurt the daughter's feelings and undermine her academic pursuits.\n\nThe daughter's reaction, while harsh, is a response to feeling neglected. The father's refusal might not be entirely his fault if the daughter's mother can afford it, but the way he frames his reasons (calling a major \"useless\") might contribute to the daughter's resentment. Additionally, the father's actions (giving a car vs. a game console) might create a perception of favoritism even if he doesn't intend it.\n\nIn terms of legal or moral obligations, the father isn't required to pay for his daughter's grad school unless there's a prior agreement. However, the emotional aspect is significant. The daughter might feel that her father is treating her differently because she's not his legal family in the same way as his son, which could exacerbate feelings of being less valued. The father's child support is a legal obligation, but financial support for education beyond that might be a personal choice. \n\nConsidering all factors, the father's decision is based on his own financial considerations and perceptions. However, the daughter's feelings of being undervalued are valid, especially if the support is withheld due to subjective reasons like the choice of major. The father's justification might not address the emotional impact on the daughter. Therefore, while he may not be legally or financially in the wrong, his actions could be considered unfair or hurtful, making him the asshole in the situation.\n"
