I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a father who had a one-night stand and ended up with a daughter. He's been paying child support for her, which is a significant amount. Now, the daughter is asking for help with grad school, but the author is paying for his son's undergrad. The daughter gets angry, calling him sexist. The author lists several reasons: he pays child support, the daughter's school is expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom is wealthy, and the son's major is practical.\n\nHmm. The author is justifying the difference in financial support. But is he in the wrong? Well, legally, he's obligated to pay child support for the daughter, so maybe that's why he's contributing more there. But when it comes to paying for college, the situation is different. The daughter's mother is well-off, so maybe the author should consider that. Also, the daughter is grown and in grad school, so perhaps she's responsible for her own expenses. The author mentions he's not a bank, but he's paying for the son's undergrad. That might be seen as unequal treatment. \n\nThe daughter feels it's unfair, especially since the author isn't paying for her undergrad either. The author gave her a car, which is a one-time expense. The son's mom has a lower income, so maybe that's why he's helping with school costs. But the daughter is now in grad school, and the author refuses. There's also the issue of the daughter's major being considered \"useless\" by the author, which could be a biased view. \n\nThe author's response was to say the daughter is blowing it out of proportion, but the daughter's anger might be valid if she feels neglected. The author's treatment might be influenced by the mother's financial situation versus his wife's. However, the author is paying child support already, which is a legal obligation, but personal financial support for kids can vary. \n\nIs there a double standard here? The author is paying for the son's practical major but not the daughter's, which he deems impractical. That could be seen as unfair. Also, the daughter is in a higher expense program. The author's justification might be about financial contributions through child support versus direct college payments. \n\nBut the daughter is an adult now, and the author isn't obligated to pay for her education. However, the way he refused and the daughter's emotional reaction might be a communication issue. The author might not be in the wrong if he's meeting his legal obligations and the daughter's mother is financially capable. But the perception of favoritism could be the problem. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong since he's fulfilling his legal duty and the daughter's mother can afford it. Plus, the son's situation is different. However, the daughter's feelings are valid if she feels she's being treated unfairly. But legally and financially, the author might not be in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
