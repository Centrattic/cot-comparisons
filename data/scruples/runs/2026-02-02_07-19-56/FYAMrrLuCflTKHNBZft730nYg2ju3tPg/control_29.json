I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who is paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school, despite the daughter's mom being wealthier.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a one-night stand and his daughter from that, while his son is with his current wife. The author is a civil engineer with a good salary, paying significant child support for the daughter. He's also given her a car, which was expensive. The daughter is upset because he's paying for her half-brother's undergrad but not hers for grad school. Her mom earns a high salary, whereas his wife's income is much lower. The author's reasons include the cost difference between private vs. state schools, the son's practical major, and the daughter's more expensive graduate program. He feels he's already contributing a lot through child support and the car, and the daughter is being disrespectful by comparing them and calling him sexist.\n\nNow, to assess if he's in the wrong. The main issue is fairness between the children. The author is providing financial support for the son through his current wife, who is less financially stable, while the daughter's mom is wealthier. But the daughter is his biological child, and he's already paying child support, which might cover general expenses, including education. However, he's not using that support for her education, and instead gives a car. The son is in a practical major, which might have better job prospects, so supporting his undergraduate education could be seen as investing in a more stable future. The daughter is choosing a graduate program, which is more expensive, and perhaps the author is concerned about the return on investment. But he's also giving her things like a car, which is a different form of support.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is strong, but maybe she feels he's favoring the son because he's with his current wife. The author might be unintentionally showing favoritism by allocating resources differently, even if he's providing other support. The question is whether it's fair to treat them differently based on the mother's financial situation and the type of education. Legally, the author is fulfilling his child support obligations, but morally, is it wrong to not pay for grad school when he can afford it? The daughter might feel entitled to similar support, especially as a parent, the author has a responsibility to both children regardless of their mothers' incomes. The author's argument is that the son's education is cheaper and more practical, but that could be seen as discriminatory. The fact that the daughter already has a car and the son has a game console might also play into perceived inequalities.\n\nThe daughter's accusation of sexism is a strong term, but maybe she's lashing out. The author's response about not being a bank and that money is his might be seen as dismissive. Even if he has reasons, treating the daughter's request as trivial could be seen as lacking support. Additionally, the author might be internalizing the mother's financial capability, but the child's education is a parental duty, even if the other parent can afford it. The fact that he's using different standards for each child could be the issue. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being consistent and for not considering the daughter's perspective. But there are nuances, like the child support already being a legal obligation and the differing financial situations of the two mothers. However, as a parent, he might be expected to treat both children equally in terms of educational support, regardless of the other parent's income. The daughter's major being \"useless\" is also a problematic assumption; the author shouldn't judge her choices. So, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not treating both children fairly and is making assumptions about their choices, even if the reasons are understandable.\n"
