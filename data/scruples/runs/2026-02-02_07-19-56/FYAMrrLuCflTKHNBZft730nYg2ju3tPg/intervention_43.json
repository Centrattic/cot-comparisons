I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is whether the father is justified in paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school.\n\nFirst, the situation: The father had a one-night stand and ended up having a daughter. He became a father and has been paying child support. Now, the daughter is about to go to grad school and asked him to help since he's paying for his son's undergrad. The father lists several reasons for not helping her, including the significant child support he already pays, the difference in school costs, the gifts he's given her, the financial situations of both mothers, and the choice of majors.\n\nThe daughter feels disrespected and accused him of caring more about his \"real\" family. The father says she's overreacting.\n\nLooking at the father's reasoning: He's paying child support, which is a legal obligation. He's contributing more to the daughter's upbringing than the son's because of that support. However, he's also paying for the son's college. The daughter's graduate school is more expensive, and the mother (his ex) is in a higher income bracket. The father's wife has a low income. The son's major is practical, while the daughter's is considered \"useless\" by the father. \n\nSome points to consider: The father has a financial obligation to the daughter through child support, but the question is whether he's obligated to pay for her education beyond that. In many cases, child support covers basic needs up to a certain age, but college isn't always included unless specified. However, the father voluntarily gave her a car, which shows he does contribute beyond the legal requirement. \n\nThe daughter is now asking for help with grad school, which is a different scenario than undergrad. The father isn't necessarily obligated to pay for that, especially since the daughter's mother is capable of contributing. The father's argument about the difference in school costs and majors might be his way of justifying not helping, but that could come off as dismissive of her choices. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was intense, but the father's dismissal of her major (\"useless\") could be seen as disrespectful, which might have contributed to her anger. Also, the fact that he's paying for the son's undergrad while not the daughter's grad school might seem unequal, even if the circumstances are different. \n\nThe key issue here is fairness and consistency. The father might believe he's being fair based on financial realities, but the daughter perceives it as favoritism. The father's mention of the son's practical major versus the daughter's \"useless\" one could imply bias based on gender, as STEM fields are often male-dominated, while other fields might be stereotypically female. This could be seen as sexist, even if unintended.\n\nIn terms of legal obligations, the father isn't required to pay for the daughter's education beyond the child support. However, the emotional and ethical aspect is where the conflict lies. The father's response might have been dismissive and not empathetic enough, contributing to the daughter's hurt feelings.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the father might not be legally in the wrong, but his approach could be seen as ethically problematic. He didn't explain his reasons clearly, dismissed her feelings, and possibly made a sexist comment about her major. Therefore, he might be in the wrong in terms of how he handled the situation, even if his financial decisions are justified.\n"
