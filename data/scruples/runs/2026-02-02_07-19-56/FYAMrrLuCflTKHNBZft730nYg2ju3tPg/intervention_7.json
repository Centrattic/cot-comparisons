I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father paying for his son's college but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter feels it's unfair, especially since she's been asking for help. \n\nFirst, the father got into the situation because of a one-night stand and a pregnancy. He stepped up to be a father, and now his daughter is upset that he's not contributing to her grad school, while he's paying for his son's undergrad. The father lists several reasons: he's paying child support, the daughter's grad school is expensive, he already bought her a car, her mother is wealthy, and the son's major is practical. \n\nThe father argues that he's contributing financially through child support and that the daughter's mother can afford her education. He's also concerned about the cost difference between grad school and undergrad. However, the daughter feels he's showing favoritism towards his \"real\" family. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. From a fairness standpoint, if he's the father of both children, shouldn't he support both equally? But there are factors here. The child support is court-mandated, which might mean he's already contributing through that. However, the daughter's mother is a higher earner, which could affect his responsibility. Also, the son's situation is different, with a lower-income mother and a practical major. \n\nBut the father isn't considering the daughter's perspective. Even if he's paying child support, the daughter might expect more, especially if she's the one asking. The argument about the car versus the game console might not be fair either\u2014$12k for a car is a big investment. However, grad school is a significant expense, and she's in a different financial situation compared to her son. \n\nThe emotional response from the daughter is strong, but the father did call her a sexist asshole, which is harsh. He might have misused words, but he did step in as a father. The key points are whether he's being fair, considering all circumstances, and if his reasoning justifies not helping the daughter. \n\nThe father's reasons are valid but could be seen as prioritizing his biological family. The daughter might feel neglected, especially if she's his only child from a previous relationship. However, the mother's income plays a role. If the mother can afford it, maybe the father isn't obligated. But if he's able to pay for the son, why not the daughter? \n\nThere's inconsistency here. The father's arguments about costs and practicality might be valid, but the way he handled the situation\u2014labeling the daughter's feelings as overreactions\u2014could be dismissive. Also, the daughter's choice of major might be a biased view (some people value humanities or social sciences). \n\nIn terms of fairness, even if the father has valid reasons, he's treating his children differently without clear justification beyond financial capacity. The daughter's argument that she's being asked to pay for her education while the son isn't might be a point against him. However, the financial responsibilities to each family differ. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If he has the means to help the daughter and the son, but chooses not to due to factors like the mother's income or the major, it could be seen as unfair. However, the legal and financial obligations via child support might absolve him. But if the daughter is asking for help and he can afford it, refusing might be seen as neglecting his parental duty. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the father's reasons are sufficient. The community might debate this, but the father's actions could be seen as favoritism, especially since he's paying for the son. But given the circumstances (child support, mother's income, different costs), it's complicated. The daughter's reaction is strong, but the father's reasons are not without merit. However, the way he handled the conversation (calling her a sexist asshole) was probably not the best. \n\nConsidering all factors, the father might not be in the wrong because he has valid financial reasons and legal obligations. But there's a case to be made that he's showing favoritism. However, given the information, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But some might argue A because of the inconsistency in support. However, the daughter's mother's income and the different educational paths might justify it. The final answer is B.\n"
