I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and his daughter was the result. He's been paying child support, which is significant. The daughter now wants help with grad school, but he's not offering. He lists reasons like the child support already covers more than his son's expenses, the daughter's school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom can afford it, and her major is considered less practical.\n\nThe key points here are the legal obligation of child support. Since he's already paying child support, which is court-mandated, maybe that's meant to cover her needs. But grad school might be beyond what child support covers. Also, the daughter's mother is wealthy, so maybe the author isn't the only one who should support her.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter might feel that since her father is helping his other child, she should get the same. But the author argues practicality\u2014his son's major is more practical, and the costs are different. Also, he gave her a car, which the son didn't get. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, calling him sexist, but the author claims it's not about favoritism. The question is whether his decision is fair. Legally, he's meeting his obligations with child support.Financially, he's contributing more to the daughter already. However, emotional support and fairness might be subjective. The author's reasons seem valid, but the daughter's feelings of being treated differently could be valid too. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's following the court's decision and considering his financial contributions, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he refused might have been harsh, but the user is asking about the wrong in terms of the decision, not the delivery. So, B might be the answer.\n"
