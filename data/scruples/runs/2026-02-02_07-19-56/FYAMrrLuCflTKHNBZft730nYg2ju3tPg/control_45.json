I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's situation: he had a one-night stand and became a father to a daughter. The mother kept the child, and he stepped up as a father. Now, the daughter is graduating undergrad and wants help with grad school. He's paying for his son's undergrad, which is less expensive, and the daughter is upset he's not helping her. He lists several reasons: he pays child support which is a lot, the daughter's grad school is expensive, he already gave her a car, the son's mom is poor while the daughter's mom is wealthy, and the son's major is practical versus the daughter's \"useless\" one.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The author is paying child support for the daughter, which the courts deemed necessary. That's a legal obligation, but he's arguing that the amount he pays is significant. However, he's choosing to pay for the son's college, not the daughter's grad school. The daughter's mom is financially better off, which is a point the author brings up. But does that mean he's not obligated to help his daughter further?\n\nEthically, there's a question of fairness. The author is a parent to both children. Even though the daughter was from a one-night stand, he's been involved. The son's mother is mentioned to have a low income, so he's helping with the son's education. But the daughter's mother can afford it, so he's not giving her money. However, the daughter might feel that he's not treating her equally as a child. The author's reasons include financial contributions through child support, but that's a legal requirement, not a personal choice. The argument about the son's major being practical could be seen as discriminatory, implying that the daughter's field isn't valuable, which could be sexist or biased.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is emotional, but the author's refusal might be seen as favoring his biological family (son and wife) over the daughter. Even if the author isn't legally obligated, morally, is he wrong for not supporting his daughter equally? The fact that he gave her a car but not financial help for grad school might be seen as inconsistent. Also, the comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" is problematic, as it undermines her academic choices, which can be a form of sexism or bias.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as unfair to his daughter. While he has valid reasons about financial contributions and his wife's situation, the core issue is whether he's treating his children equally. The daughter might feel she's being treated differently because she's not part of his \"real\" family, which the author denies. The use of the term \"real family\" and the daughter's accusation of sexism are significant. The author's reasons might not excuse the perception of unequal treatment. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions could be seen as discriminatory based on gender or family structure, even if he has justifications.\n"
