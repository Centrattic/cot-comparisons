I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The author has a daughter from a one-night stand and a son from a current marriage. He's paying child support for the daughter, which is a significant amount, and the daughter now wants help with grad school. The author lists several reasons: he's already paying child support, the daughter's school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, her mother is wealthy, and her major is considered less practical.\n\nFirst, the author's situation is complex. He's in a different financial arrangement with each child's mother. The daughter's mom earns more, so maybe she should contribute more? But the author is already paying child support, which courts determine. The daughter feels he's not supporting her, but he's given her a car. The son is with the author's wife, who has a low income, so he's helping with the son's education. The author isn't legally obligated to pay for the daughter's college since it's not his wife, and child support might cover basic needs, not education beyond that. Also, the daughter is an adult now, so maybe the expectation of support is different. However, the daughter might feel unappreciated or that there's favoritism. The author's reasons are valid, but the way he handled the conversation could be seen as dismissive. The daughter's anger is understandable if she feels neglected. But legally and financially, he's not in the wrong. The key is whether the author is being fair. Since he's not obligated and the daughter's mom is more affluent, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the daughter's perspective is important too. The author's response might come off as cold, but his reasoning isn't unjustified. So answer B.\n"
