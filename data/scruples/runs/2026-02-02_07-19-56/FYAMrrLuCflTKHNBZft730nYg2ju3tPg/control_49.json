I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a father who had a one-night stand and a daughter from that. He's been paying child support for her. Now, his daughter is asking him to help with her grad school, but he's not paying for her undergrad and is paying for his son's undergrad. The daughter feels he's favoring his \"real\" family (his son with his wife) over her.\n\nSo, first, the key points: He's paying child support for the daughter, which is a legal obligation. The daughter is now in grad school, which is expensive. The son is going to a cheaper state school. The author argues that he's already contributing more through child support and that the daughter's mother is wealthy enough. He also mentions the daughter's major is \"useless,\" which is a judgment he shouldn't make. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, he's not paying for the daughter's undergrad, which she had to cover herself (he gave her a car instead). Now grad school is being asked for, and he's not helping. The daughter's argument is about inequality. But he's using reasons like financial contributions already made, differing costs, and the practicality of majors. \n\nThe daughter's anger is valid because he's not treating both children equally in education support. Even if the son is his biological child, the daughter is his daughter too. The fact that he's paying child support but not covering her education when her mother is able to might be seen as neglecting his role as a father. Also, the comment about her major being \"useless\" is problematic and could contribute to her feeling undervalued.\n\nHowever, the author's points about financial contributions and the mother's ability to pay are valid considerations. But the daughter's perception of being treated differently might lead to her feeling the author is in the wrong. The author's response to her outburst as being \"disrespectful\" without acknowledging her feelings could also be an issue. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, parents often try to treat children equally, but in this case, the author is clearly prioritizing the son's education over the daughter's, even though the daughter is his child too. The daughter's accusation of sexism is a stretch since it's about gender, but the father's actions do show a lack of fairness. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not providing equal educational support to both children, making judgments about the daughter's major, and not acknowledging her feelings adequately. The child support is a legal requirement, but as a father, supporting her education could be seen as fair, especially since he helped with the car. The son's practical major is his choice, but the daughter's choices should be respected equally. The author's justification based on financial contributions and the mother's salary doesn't negate the daughter's right to expect support from both parents. The final answer is A.\n"
