I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and ended up with a daughter. He stepped up to be a father, pays child support, and has given her a car. However, he's not paying for her grad school. The daughter feels this is unfair since he's paying for his son's undergrad. The author lists several reasons: child support is already a significant amount, the daughter's school is more expensive, he gave her a car while the son got games, the daughter's mother is wealthier, and the son's major is more practical.\n\nSo, the key points here are equality between children, financial responsibility, and fairness. The author is using several justifications, but is he in the wrong? Well, from a fairness standpoint, both children are his kids. The fact that he's paying child support doesn't negate his responsibility to both. The daughter might feel he's showing favoritism, especially since she's been given less support in the past. The author's reasoning includes financial calculations, but it might come off as inconsistent. Also, the way he responded to her anger could have been better, but the core issue is the unequal treatment. \n\nThe daughter's accusation that he cares more for his \"real\" family is harsh, but the author's actions might have led her to feel that. Even if he's paying more to the daughter through child support, the fact that he's not helping with her grad school when she's struggling could be seen as unfair. The son's practical major versus the daughter's more expensive program is a point, but the author's responsibility as a parent might be to support both equitably. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, parents are often expected to treat children equally, regardless of circumstances. The author's actions might be seen as discriminatory, even if he has valid reasons. The daughter's reaction is extreme, but the parent's decision to favor one child over another based on financial and other factors could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he's showing favoritism despite the daughter's need and his own resources.\n"
