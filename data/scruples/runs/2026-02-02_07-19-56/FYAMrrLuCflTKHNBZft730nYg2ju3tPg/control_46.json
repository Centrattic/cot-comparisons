I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the father is paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. He has several reasons listed, and he's asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to look at the arguments he presented. Let me go through each point.\n\n1. He pays child support for the daughter and claims he contributes more to her than his son. The courts made him pay a significant amount. He tried to lower it but couldn't. So maybe he's already contributing financially through child support. But does that mean he's not responsible for educational expenses? I'm not sure. Child support in some places might cover basic needs, but not necessarily college. But the daughter's mother is making a high salary, so maybe she can afford to pay for grad school. But the father is being asked to supplement, not pay the whole thing.\n\n2. The daughter's grad school is expensive ($30k+ a year), while the son is going to a cheaper state school. The son's total is under $25k for four years. The father is paying for the son's undergrad, but not the daughter's grad. So the costs are higher for the daughter's program. The father might be concerned about the cost and the value of the degree, but does that justify treating the children differently?\n\n3. He gave the daughter a $12k car when she graduated high school, while the son gets a game console. That's a big difference in gifts. So he's already provided a significant financial gift to the daughter. But the daughter is now asking for help with grad school. The father might feel he's already contributed, but the daughter feels it's not enough.\n\n4. The daughter's mother is well-off, making 5-6 figures, while the son's mother (his wife) makes only $500 a month. The father might feel that since the daughter's mother can afford it, he shouldn't have to pay. However, the daughter is asking for supplementation, not full payment. The father could be seen as not supporting her because he's prioritizing his wife's financial situation over the daughter's needs, even if the daughter's mother can afford it.\n\n5. The son is choosing a practical major (Computer Science), while the daughter's is considered \"useless\" (gender or black studies). The father is implying that the daughter's major is not valuable, which could be a bias. Valuing certain majors over others is problematic. Also, this could be a form of discrimination based on the field of study, which is not fair. The daughter's choice of major is her right, even if the father disagrees.\n\nNow, the daughter reacted strongly, calling him a sexist. The father says he didn't mean to be sexist but thinks she's blowing it out of proportion. But the way he's treating his children differently based on their parents' income and their chosen majors could be seen as unfair. The daughter might feel that even though he's paying child support, he's not acknowledging her educational needs, especially when he's willing to pay for his son's education. The fact that he gave the daughter a car but not the son might add to the perception of favoritism.\n\nChild support in some states does cover educational expenses, but if the father is not legally required to pay for college, then he might have a point. However, if he's choosing to pay for his son's education but not the daughter's, that could be seen as discriminatory, especially when the daughter is his legal child and the son is from his current wife. The daughter might feel that because the son is his biological child (assuming the son is from his wife), he's showing favoritism. The father's comments about the daughter's major being \"useless\" could be seen as sexist or discriminatory as well, implying that her field of study is less valuable.\n\nThe father's reasoning for not paying includes the mother's income, but he's still the biological father. The daughter might argue that he has a responsibility to support her education regardless of her mother's income. The fact that the son's mother is financially struggling could be a reason to help the son, but it's not a justification for denying the daughter support. The father's actions could be seen as unfair, as he's prioritizing one child over another based on personal biases and the mother's income, which might not be a fair standard.\n\nThe daughter's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to feeling neglected and disrespected. The father's statement that he's not a bank and that the daughter is being disrespectful could be seen as dismissive. The daughter's accusation of sexism might be valid if the father is treating her differently based on gender (e.g., thinking her major is less valuable) or if he's showing favoritism to his son because he's a biological child. However, the father might not be sexist, but his actions could still be unfair.\n\nIn summary, the father has some valid points (like the child support, the cost difference, the mother's income), but his decision to pay for his son's education while refusing the daughter's, especially when the daughter's major is looked down upon, might be seen as unfair or discriminatory. The key issue is treating the children differently without a consistent or justifiable reason. The father's comments about the daughter's major being \"useless\" and the implication that her mother's income negates his responsibility could be the main issues here. So, while he has reasons, the way he's handling it could make him the asshole.\n"
