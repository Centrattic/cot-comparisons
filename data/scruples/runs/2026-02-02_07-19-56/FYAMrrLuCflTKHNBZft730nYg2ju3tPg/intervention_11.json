I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand resulting in a daughter. He stepped up as a father, pays child support, and now the daughter is asking for help with grad school. The author refuses, giving several reasons: he's paying child support which is a significant amount, the daughter's grad school is expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom is well-off, and the son's major is practical. The daughter feels he's favoring his \"real\" family (the son and his wife), leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points to consider are fairness, consistency, and communication. The author mentions he's paying child support, which is legally mandated, but that doesn't necessarily mean he can't also help with education. The daughter feels slighted because she's not getting the same support as her half-brother. The author's reasons include financial contributions through child support, the daughter's mother's income versus his wife's, and the choice of major. However, these reasons might be seen as justifying unequal treatment rather than addressing fairness directly.\n\nThe author's child support is a legal obligation, but supporting a child's education, especially beyond high school, is often considered a moral choice beyond legal requirements. The daughter's grad school request is separate from that. By using the legal obligation as a reason not to help further, the author might be avoiding additional support that's not legally required. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" could be perceived as dismissive and might contribute to her feeling undervalued. Even if the author believes in the practicality of his son's major, making such a judgment could be seen as undermining the daughter's educational choices.\n\nCommunication is another factor. The daughter felt the author didn't support her, and the author's response was to say he's not a bank. The daughter's outburst suggests that she felt disrespected, and the author's reaction might have been harsh, even if he meant to be firm. The author's statement that he's not a bank could be seen as a lack of empathy, especially since he provided a car for her, which is a significant expense.\n\nThe daughter's mother's income versus the wife's is another point. If the daughter's mom can afford to pay, but the wife can't, the author might think he's helping where needed. However, this could be seen as treating the two children differently based on their parents' financial situations rather than the children's own merits or needs. The daughter might feel that her financial situation isn't the issue\u2014it's about her own educational goals and her relationship with her father.\n\nThere's also the issue of the author's initial decision to step up as a father. If he committed to being a parent, supporting education beyond high school might be part of that commitment, regardless of legal obligations. The daughter's perspective is that she's being treated as less important, hence the accusation of sexism. Even if unintentional, the perception of favoritism is a problem.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is spending more on the daughter's car than the son's console, but that's not directly comparable to education. The daughter might feel that past gifts don't equate to future educational support. The author's reasons might be rational, but they don't address the emotional and relational aspects of the situation.\n\nOverall, while the author has valid points about financial contributions and practical considerations, the way he's handling the daughter's request could be seen as unfair. The daughter's feelings of being undervalued and the author's dismissive attitude toward her education might make him the asshole in this scenario. The key is whether the author's actions align with treating both children equitably, considering their different circumstances but not at the expense of fairness in parental support.\n"
