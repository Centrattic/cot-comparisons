I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's graduate school. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider all the points he made.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and the mother didn't abort, leading to the daughter's birth. He stepped up as a father, so there's a history of commitment there. Now, the daughter is asking for grad school help, but he's not willing. The reasons he lists include child support payments which are significant, the daughter's choice of expensive private school, the son's more practical major, and the financial situations of both households. \n\nThe key factors here are fairness, financial responsibility, and potential biases. The author mentions that he pays a significant amount in child support, which the courts mandated. That might be a factor in why he's not providing additional funds for the daughter's grad school. However, the daughter is now in a different educational phase, and grad school can be expensive. The author is paying for his son's undergraduate, which is cheaper because it's a state school. The daughter's grad school is more expensive, but the author has already spent $12k on a car for her, which is a significant personal expense. \n\nThe daughter's mother has a higher income, which might mean the author isn't the sole financial supporter for the daughter. The author's wife, on the other hand, has a lower income, so he's helping her with the son's education. The author argues that the son's major is practical, but that might be a bias. He's making a judgment about the usefulness of the daughter's field of study, which could be problematic. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was emotional, but the author's response about not being a bank and his comment about the daughter's mother's ability to pay might come off as dismissive. The author's justification for not paying the daughter but the son could be seen as favoritism, especially if the daughter's field isn't considered as 'useful.' However, the financial realities he presents are real\u2014supporting both might be beyond his means. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The daughter feels neglected, and the author's reasoning might have elements of bias, like valuing practical majors over others. Even if he has financial constraints, the way he's handling it could be seen as unfair. The courts might require him to pay child support, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's not responsible for educational support beyond that. \n\nAdditionally, the author's comment about the daughter's field of study being 'useless' is a clear bias. That could be a significant factor in his decision, which is problematic because it's a subjective judgment about her choices. The daughter might feel that her interests are being devalued. \n\nConsidering all these points, while the author has valid financial reasons, the presence of bias and the way he's treating his children differently based on gender or subjective judgments about their choices could make him in the wrong. The daughter's feelings of being less valued by her father might be justified if the author is, consciously or not, showing favoritism towards his 'real' family (the son) over the daughter from the one-night stand. Even if it's not intentional, the impact on the daughter is clear. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, given the emphasis on gender and subjective value judgments, it's likely A.\n"
