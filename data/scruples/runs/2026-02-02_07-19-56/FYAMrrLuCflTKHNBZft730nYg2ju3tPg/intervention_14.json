I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the father) is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The daughter feels it's unfair, and the father lists several reasons.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand that resulted in the daughter. He stepped up as a father, but there's a history of child support. He's paying for his son's undergrad and not the daughter's grad school. The daughter is upset because she feels she's being discriminated against. The father cites reasons like child support already being a significant amount, the daughter's expensive school choice, the mother's financial situation versus his wife's, the son's practical major vs. daughter's \"useless\" one, and the car vs. console gifts.\n\nNow, considering fairness and equality. The father is a civil engineer with a good salary. He pays child support to the daughter's mother, which is a legal obligation. He's also helping his son, who is part of his current family. But is it fair to treat two children differently based on their families' financial situations? The daughter's mother earns a high salary, so maybe she should cover the grad school, but the father is contributing despite that. On the flip side, the son's mother has a lower income, so the father is helping there.\n\nThe father's argument about the child support being more than what he spends on his son's education could be a point. But using that as a reason not to help the daughter might not be equitable. Also, calling her major \"useless\" is a judgment that could be seen as biased. The daughter might feel he's valuing practicality over her interests, which could be a form of unfair treatment.\n\nThe father's response to her anger was dismissive, telling her to talk later when she's less emotional. That might not be supportive. Also, his justification of financial priorities could be viewed as a way to avoid responsibility, especially if he can afford to help both. The daughter's frustration is valid if she feels there's no clear reason for the disparity beyond personal biases.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is providing for both children in different ways\u2014supporting his current family's needs, contributing to the son's education, and the daughter's car. The daughter's mother's income is a factor, but the father is still contributing to the daughter's education through support payments. However, the key issue is whether the father's refusal is based on legitimate financial reasons or perceived differences in the children's value, like gender or choice of major.\n\nThe father's own admission of being a \"civil engineer with a decent salary\" suggests he can afford to contribute to both. The daughter's mother's high income doesn't negate the father's responsibility to support his child's education if he can. The fact that he's paying for the son's state school while the daughter's grad school is more expensive might be a point, but if he can afford to pay for the son's, he should be able to help the daughter, especially if the child support already covers a significant portion.\n\nThe use of derogatory terms like calling her major \"useless\" and the judgmental attitude toward her choices could be seen as sexist or discriminatory. The daughter's reaction of feeling unloved might stem from feeling that her father values practicality over her interests, which is a gendered stereotype. The mother's higher income is a factor, but the father's role in her education shouldn't be completely off the table if he has the means.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father has valid financial considerations, the way he's handling the situation and the reasons he gives (especially regarding the daughter's choices) might be seen as unfair or discriminatory. The daughter's feelings are valid, and the father's response could be perceived as dismissive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
