I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The situation is a bit complex with a one-night stand leading to a daughter, and now a half-son from his current marriage.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he's paying child support for his daughter. The courts have him contributing a significant amount, more than he does for his son. So he's already financially involved with his daughter's upbringing. The daughter is now asking for help with grad school because her mom isn't covering it, and he's saying no. His reasons include the child support, the cost difference between schools, previous gifts (like the car), the mother's financial ability, and the son's practical major vs. the daughter's \"useless\" one.\n\nNow, the daughter is upset, feeling discriminated against. The author claims he's not a bank and that his money is his. But there's a key point here: he's a parent. Even if the daughter is from a one-night stand, he stepped up to be a father. Financial support for education is often seen as a parental duty, especially if the parent is in a position to help. The fact that he's paying child support already might mean he's already contributing, but that doesn't necessarily negate the responsibility to support her education, especially since the other parent is not helping. \n\nHe also mentions the mother's high salary, but if the mother is capable, maybe the daughter should ask her? However, the daughter did approach the author, possibly because he's more available or willing. The author's argument about the son's practical major versus the daughter's \"useless\" one is problematic. It's paternalistic and dismissive of her academic choices, which could be seen as sexist or biased. \n\nThe author's response to the daughter's anger was to say his money is his and that she's being disrespectful. But if the parent is in a position to help, refusing might not be the right approach, especially if the child is in a good academic position. The daughter's feeling of being less loved because of this is hurtful, and the author's justification using financials and past gifts might not address the emotional aspect. \n\nThe key issues here are fairness between children, the father's role in supporting education, and the dismissive attitude towards the daughter's chosen field. Even if the author has his reasons, the way he handled it and the underlying biases (like calling the daughter's major useless) might make him the asshole. So I think the answer is A.\n"
