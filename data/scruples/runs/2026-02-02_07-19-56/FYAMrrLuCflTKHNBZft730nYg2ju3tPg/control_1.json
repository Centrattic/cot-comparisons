I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The situation is complex, so I need to consider multiple angles.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and the daughter is from that relationship. He's been paying child support, which is a legal obligation. He's stepping up as a father, giving her a car and time every other weekend. The daughter is now in grad school and expects him to help, but he's not. The son is from his current marriage, and he's paying for his undergrad. The daughter feels this is unfair.\n\nLooking at his reasons: 1. Child support is already a significant amount. Courts mandated it, so he can't lower it. 2. The daughter's grad school is expensive, while the son's program is cheaper. 3. He gave her a car, which cost more than what he's giving the son. 4. Her mother is wealthy, whereas his wife isn't. 5. The son's major is practical; the daughter's is considered less so.\n\nHe claims he's not a bank and that his money is his. The daughter accused him of sexism. The key points here are financial responsibility, fairness between children, and the nature of their relationship. Legally, child support is for the child's upbringing, but does that cover education? The author was not the one to pay for her undergraduate, so grad school might be outside his obligation unless specified. \n\nFinancially, he's already contributing more through child support. The daughter's mother can afford to pay, while his wife can't. The son's education is more affordable, and practical vs. \"useless\" majors might influence his decision. However, the daughter's anger stems from feeling unequal treatment. Even if there are valid financial reasons, the emotional impact is significant. \n\nThe author's response to her anger was to shut down the conversation, which might make her feel dismissed. Also, he did pay for her car, which was a big expense, suggesting he's willing to invest in her in some ways. The daughter's accusation of sexism is a strong term, but the author's actions are based on financial and practical considerations. However, treating children unequally, even for reasons, can be seen as unfair. \n\nIs it sexist? The author is a father to both children. The difference in treatment is based on circumstances (child support, financial situations, majors), not gender per se. But the daughter's perspective is that he's favoring his \"real\" family, which implies she feels less connected. The author's response of calling her a \"sexist\" and his own reaction might not address her emotional needs. \n\nIn terms of ethics, fairness is subjective. The author's reasons are valid from a financial standpoint, but the daughter's hurt feelings are real. The question is whether unequal treatment is wrong regardless of reasons. The answer would depend on cultural values and personal ethics. In many societies, parents are expected to support all children equally, but financial realities and legal obligations can complicate that. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the question is about fairness and emotional impact, maybe A. If it's about just the financial and legal reasons, maybe B. The author's stance is that he's not a bank, and his reasons are practical. However, the daughter's accusation of sexism is a red herring, but the unequal treatment is there. The answer might be A because he's choosing to favor one child over another based on circumstances that might not be his fault, but the daughter's perspective is valid in feeling unappreciated. Alternatively, B if the reasons are justified. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is within his legal rights but the ethical stance is debatable. The daughter's feelings are valid, but the author's financial constraints and legal obligations are real. However, the way he handled the conversation (shutting her down) could be seen as dismissive. The answer might lean towards B because he's explaining his reasons, but some might argue A because of the unequal treatment. But given the context, B might be the safer answer.\n"
