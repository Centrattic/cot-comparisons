I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is a father who had a one-night stand and ended up being a dad to a daughter. Now, his daughter is asking for help with grad school, but he's not willing to pay for her while he is paying for his son's undergrad. The daughter is upset and called him sexist. The author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the reasons he gave. Let's go through each point. \n\n1. He pays child support which is significant. The court made him pay, and he tried to get it lowered but couldn't. He argues he's already contributing more through child support than to his son. That seems like a valid legal obligation, but does that mean he's not responsible for her education beyond that?\n\n2. The daughter wants to go to an expensive private grad school, costing $30k+/year for two years, while the son is going to a state school for under $25k total. The father is paying for the son's cheaper education but not her more expensive one. This could be seen as unequal treatment, but maybe the son's major is more practical, and the father is using that as reasoning. But is it fair to base support on the field of study?\n\n3. The daughter got a car from him, while the son got a game console. That's a big difference in spending. Maybe he's trying to balance things, but it's unclear if that's relevant to educational support. The car is a one-time expense, while education is ongoing. Maybe the comparison isn't fair.\n\n4. The daughter's mom is wealthy, while his wife (son's mom) earns less. So he's helping the lower-income family. That seems like a valid point. If the daughter's mother can afford it, maybe he's not obligated to pay for her. But does that mean it's okay to not help her even if her mom can afford it?\n\n5. The son's major is practical (Computer Science) versus the daughter's \"useless\" degree. The father is suggesting that the value of the major affects his decision. This is problematic because it's discriminatory to devalue certain fields of study, especially if it's based on stereotypes. It's not fair to judge someone's choice of major as useless just because it's not as directly lucrative.\n\nNow, the daughter feels he's being sexist because he's favoring his \"real\" family (his son) over her. The father is her biological father and the child's mother had the abortion decision. The daughter might feel he's not treating her as his own child. The father says he's a good father by spending time with her but the financial support is separate.\n\nThe key issues here are fairness, financial responsibility, and potential bias. The father's reasons include financial obligations, cost differences, and the practicality of majors. However, using the daughter's major as a reason for not supporting her could be seen as sexist or biased, as it's a judgment based on gendered expectations (e.g., women should pursue practical fields). Also, the fact that he's paying for the son but not the daughter despite different circumstances might be seen as unequal treatment, especially if the daughter is also his child.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is intense, but maybe she feels undervalued. The father's response might have been dismissive, leading to the argument. The father's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" is problematic. Even if he's not legally obligated, as a parent, he might have a moral obligation to support his child's education without bias.\n\nSo, considering the reasons given, the father's justification for not helping the daughter might be based on factors that reflect his own biases (like devaluing certain majors) and possibly unequal treatment. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's not treating his daughter equally and is making judgments about her choices.\n"
