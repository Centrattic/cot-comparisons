I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the father paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter is upset about this, and the father lists several reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's reasons. He mentions child support, which is a legal obligation, and he's contributing more to his daughter through that. He's paying for his son's college, which is part of his real family, perhaps. The daughter's mom is wealthy, so she could afford her grad school. The son's mom is less financially stable, so maybe the father is trying to support her. Also, the son is in a practical major, while the daughter's field is seen as less practical. The father gave the daughter a car but not the son, which might be another point. \n\nBut then, the daughter feels it's unfair. The father is being accused of sexism, which is a serious charge. He's a civil engineer with a decent salary. He's paying child support, which might be a large portion of his income. The key issues here are fairness, the reasons behind his decisions, and the daughter's reaction.\n\nThe father's arguments: 1) Child support is already a significant contribution. 2) The daughter's grad school is expensive, while the son's undergrad is cheaper. 3) He gave the daughter a car, not the son. 4) The daughter's mom is wealthy, the son's mom is not. 5) The son's major is practical. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is arguing that since he's paying for his son, he should help her too. She might feel that despite the child support, her educational needs aren't being met. The father is not legally obligated to pay for her college, as she's not his legal child? Wait, the father stepped up as a father, so maybe he's considered a parent. But legally, he might have child support obligations already. \n\nIs it fair that he's paying for his son's college but not hers? If he's the biological father of the son, it's part of his responsibility. But the daughter is from the one-night stand, so maybe he's not the legal father? The post says he had a one-night stand and \"accidentally\" got her pregnant. He stepped up to be a father, but maybe not legally. If he's not the legal father, then he's not obligated to pay for her education. However, he's been acting as a father, so there's a moral obligation. \n\nThe daughter might feel that since he's been a father to her, he should help with her education, even if it's not legally required. The father is prioritizing his legal obligations (child support, son's college) over her. The fact that her mom is wealthy might be a reason he doesn't feel the same pressure, but she might argue that he's not supporting her as a father should. \n\nAlso, the daughter's major being \"useless\" is a judgment call. The father's comment about that might be biased. The daughter's reaction is strong\u2014calling him sexist\u2014but maybe she's justified if he's treating her differently. The father's response was to say he's not a bank, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? He's making decisions based on his own criteria, but if he's been acting as a father to the daughter, then not supporting her education might be unfair. The fact that he has a financial obligation to the son but not the daughter might explain his actions, but not necessarily justify them from a moral standpoint. The daughter's feelings are hurt, and she might feel neglected. The father's reasoning about the mother's income might be a mitigating factor, but if he's acting as a father, he might feel responsible to support her regardless. \n\nThe key here is whether the father's decisions are based on fair and consistent criteria. If he's treating his daughter differently without valid reasons, then he's in the wrong. But if the reasons are legitimate (like financial obligations, the mother's ability to pay), then maybe not. However, the way he's framing it as \"my money is mine\" might be seen as selfish. The daughter might feel he's not fulfilling his role as a father to her. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the father's reasons are valid and consistent. The fact that he's paying for his son's education while not hers, especially when he's been a father to her, could be seen as unfair. The daughter's argument is that she deserves equal support. The father's reasons might be logical to him, but from an outsider's perspective, if he's not the legal father of the daughter, he might not be obligated. However, if he's been acting as a father, then not supporting her education could be considered wrong. The daughter's reaction is intense, but maybe justified if she feels neglected. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the father is in the wrong because he's treating his daughter differently despite being a father figure to her, and his reasons might not fully address her needs or the moral responsibility he's taken on. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
