I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is paying for his son's undergrad but not his daughter's grad school. The daughter feels this is unfair, especially since she's been to a private school and now grad school is expensive. The author lists several reasons: child support, the daughter's mother has a higher income, the son's major is more practical, and other gifts he's given the daughter like a car.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and the reasoning behind the decisions. The author mentions that he's contributing through child support, which the courts mandated. But does that mean he's not responsible for educational expenses beyond that? The daughter is upset because she hasn't received financial help for her college education at all, while the son is getting it. The author also points out the daughter's mother has a higher income, so maybe that's a factor. But the daughter's argument is that the father is favoring his \"real\" family, implying that he sees the son as his actual child, while the daughter is from a one-night stand. That's a red flag. Even if the daughter was from a one-night stand, once he stepped up as a parent, he has responsibilities. \n\nThe author's reasoning about the son's practical major versus the daughter's \"useless\" one is a bit condescending. It's a subjective judgment and could be seen as sexist or discriminatory, especially if he's dismissing her choice of field. Also, the daughter's reaction was intense, but the father's refusal might have been the trigger. The way he refers to her field of study as \"useless\" is problematic. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, even if there are financial reasons, treating the children differently based on their parents or their chosen fields might not be just. The daughter's mother's income is higher, but the father's role in supporting his children's education could be a separate matter. The fact that he gave a car to the daughter versus a game console to the son shows different levels of financial support beyond education. Maybe the father is being inconsistent in his support overall. \n\nHowever, the father is a civil engineer with a decent salary, but his wife (the son's mother) has a low income. The daughter's mother has a higher income, which might explain why the daughter is expected to manage her own grad school. But the father's refusal to contribute could still be seen as unfair if he's willing to support the son despite the son's mother's lower income. \n\nThe emotional aspect is important too. The daughter felt disrespected and called the father a sexist asshole, which is a strong reaction. The father's response about \"real family\" might have been hurtful and contributed to the daughter's feelings of being undervalued. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people might expect a parent to treat all their children equally, regardless of circumstances. The father's decision to pay for one child's education but not another's could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the justifications are based on gender stereotypes (like calling certain majors \"useless\") or parental income. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because his reasons for differential treatment are based on subjective and potentially biased criteria, and he may not be treating his children fairly despite the circumstances of their conception.\n"
