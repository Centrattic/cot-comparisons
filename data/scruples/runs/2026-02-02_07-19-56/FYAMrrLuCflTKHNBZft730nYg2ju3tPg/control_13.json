I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a father paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter feels this is unfair, and the father gives several reasons for his decision.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand and became a father to a daughter by accident. He's been paying child support which is a significant amount. He's also supporting his son, who's part of his married family, with a different financial situation. The daughter's mom is wealthy, while the wife has a low income. The daughter wants to attend a private grad school in a field the father considers \"useless,\" whereas the son is going into computer science. The daughter got a car from the father, while the son got a console. The father argues he's already contributing more money through child support than his son's education.\n\nHmm. So from a fairness standpoint, the father might think he's already contributing enough through child support. But from the daughter's perspective, she's asking for help, especially if her mother isn't paying. The father's refusal could be seen as unequal treatment. The father says he's not a bank, but maybe the daughter feels he's obligated as a parent. Also, the daughter's field of study being called \"useless\" might come off as dismissive, which could be a point against the father.\n\nThe father's reasoning includes financial considerations, but does that justify treating children differently? The daughter's mom can afford to pay, but maybe the father doesn't want to rely on that. The father's wife has a low income, so he's helping his son more. But the daughter might feel that since she's not part of his current family, she's being treated as less important. The daughter's emotional reaction is strong, but the father's response might be seen as harsh, like calling her a \"disrespectful\" for her anger.\n\nThe father's argument that he's already paying more via child support is a legal requirement, but does that cover educational expenses? Maybe not. The daughter might feel that the child support is for basic needs, not education. The father's decision to spend more on the son (car vs. console) and pay for his education could be seen as favoritism, especially since the son is the child from his marriage.\n\nAlso, the father's comment about the daughter's major being \"useless\" is problematic. It shows a lack of support for her academic choices, which can be hurtful. The daughter feeling less loved because of this is a serious emotional impact. The father's response of telling her to enjoy his real family might be the root of her feeling of being less important.\n\nIn terms of fairness, parents are not legally obligated to pay for their children's education beyond what's mandated, like child support. But morally, treating children equally can be important. The father's actions might be seen as favoring his current family over the daughter he has a less formal relationship with. Even if the daughter's mom is wealthy, the daughter might feel abandoned by the father's refusal to help.\n\nSo, considering all this, the father's actions could be seen as unfair, especially the part where he dismisses her field of study and the way he's treating her as less important than his son. The daughter's emotional reaction is valid given the perceived unequal treatment. The father might not be legally in the wrong, but morally, he could be failing in treating both children equally. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
