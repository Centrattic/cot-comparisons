I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The daughter got upset and called them sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given by the author. They mention several points. They pay child support, which is court-ordered and significant. The daughter's mom is wealthy, while the son's mom isn't. The son chose a practical major, and the daughter's is considered less practical. Also, they gave the daughter a car, which cost a lot, while the son got a game console. \n\nThe author argues that they're not in the wrong because of these reasons. But is that valid? Let's break it down.\n\nFairness and equality come into play here. Even if the daughter's mom is wealthy, the biological father is still a parent. The author is choosing to support one child's education over the other's. The daughter might feel that since the author is paying for the son's undergrad, they should also contribute to her grad school, especially if they consider themselves a parent to both.\n\nThe child support is a legal obligation, but the author is using it as a reason not to pay for grad school. However, just because they're already paying child support doesn't mean they can't help with educational expenses. The son's mother isn't contributing much, so the author might feel they have to step in more for the son, but the daughter's mother is able to cover her education. \n\nThe argument about the majors being practical or not is a bit subjective. Just because the author doesn't see the value in a certain degree doesn't mean it's not useful. The daughter has the right to pursue her interests, and the author's support shouldn't be contingent on the major's perceived practicality.\n\nThe author also gave the daughter a significant gift (a car) compared to the son. That might be a point, but gifts and educational support are different. The key issue is the financial contribution towards education. The daughter might feel that if the author is willing to spend money on a car for her, they could also help with her grad school.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but the author's refusal might have been the catalyst. The author says they support her academic endeavors but aren't a bank. However, the daughter might see this as unequal treatment, especially if the author considers himself a father to both. The author might be projecting their own biases, favoring the son as the \"real\" family, which the daughter picked up on.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral obligations, the author isn't legally required to pay for the daughter's education beyond child support. But morally, if they see themselves as a parent to both, they might be expected to offer some support. The daughter's request could be seen as reasonable, especially if she's graduating and looking to continue her education. \n\nThe author's response was to dismiss her feelings and label the situation as trivial, which could be hurtful. The daughter's anger might stem from feeling undervalued or treated differently. The author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging her perspective and for the insensitive response, even if their reasons make sense on paper.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions could be seen as discriminatory or unfair, even if they have logical reasons. The key is intent and how it's perceived. The daughter's reaction might be strong, but the author's refusal and the way they handled the conversation might contribute to that.\n"
