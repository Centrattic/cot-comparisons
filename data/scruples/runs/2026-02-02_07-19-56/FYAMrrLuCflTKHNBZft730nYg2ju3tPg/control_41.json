I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The main issue is that the father is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school, and she's upset about it.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand that resulted in a pregnancy. He stepped up to be a father, so he's involved with his daughter. Now the daughter is asking for help with grad school because her mother is not paying, and he's saying no. The daughter feels he cares more about his \"real\" family, which is his son and wife. \n\nHe lists several reasons: child support is already significant, the daughter is going to an expensive private school, he bought her a car, her mom is financially stable, and the son is in a practical major. The daughter got angry and called him a sexist asshole.\n\nI need to consider fairness and the father's responsibilities. He's paying child support, which is legally mandated. The daughter's mom is the primary financial supporter, while the son's mom has a lower income. The father is helping the son because the mother can't afford it. For the daughter, since her mother is financially better off, maybe it's expected that she covers her own grad school. \n\nBut the daughter might feel that since he's paying for the son, he should also pay for her. However, the father argues that he's already contributing more through child support, and the daughter's school is more expensive. Also, the son's major is practical, which might be a factor in the father's decision. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but the father's reasons are based on financial contributions and circumstances. It's a bit tricky. The father isn't legally obligated to pay for either child's education beyond child support, but there's an emotional aspect here. He's showing support by buying the car, but not the grad school. \n\nIs there a double standard? The father is helping the son because the mother can't afford it, while the daughter's mother can. So maybe it's not sexist, just based on financial need. The daughter's major might be a factor in the father's concern about the value, but that could be seen as biased. However, the main points are about financial responsibility and existing obligations. The daughter might feel slighted, but the father's actions are justified by his reasoning. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the father is not in the wrong) because his decisions are based on financial circumstances and existing support systems, even though the daughter perceives it as unfair.\n"
