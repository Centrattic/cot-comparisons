I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author paying for his son's undergraduate education but refusing to help with his daughter's graduate school, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gives for not paying for his daughter's grad school. Let's go through each point:\n\n1. He pays child support for the daughter, which he says is a significant amount, more than what he pays for his son. But the daughter argues he's not contributing to her education. However, in many jurisdictions, child support is meant to cover the child's basic needs and education, so maybe the author isn't required to pay for grad school again. But the daughter might feel that since he already pays child support, helping with grad school is expected.\n\n2. The daughter is going to an expensive private grad school, while the son is attending a state school. The author is paying for the son's undergrad. But the daughter's grad school is much more expensive. This seems like a valid financial consideration, as the costs are significantly higher. However, the daughter might feel that the author is favoring his son because he's a \"real\" family member (implying the son is from his marriage, while the daughter is from the one-night stand). \n\n3. The author bought the daughter a car with his own money when she graduated high school, while the son got a game console. This shows he has spent money on the daughter before, which the daughter might argue is a precedent for him contributing to her education.\n\n4. The daughter's mother earns a high salary, so she can afford her education, while the author's wife (son's mother) has a low income. The author is helping his son because his wife can't afford it. This seems like a reasonable point; the author is supporting his son because the mother can't cover the costs. However, the daughter might argue that she can't afford grad school without his help, but the author claims her mom can. If her mom can afford it, maybe the author isn't obligated unless he wants to, but the daughter's anger could be because she feels he's not supporting her despite her efforts.\n\n5. The son is choosing a practical major (Computer Science), while the daughter is going into a field the author considers \"useless\" (gender/black studies). This is a problematic point because it's discriminatory. The author is devaluing the daughter's chosen field of study, which could be seen as sexist or biased. Even if the author's opinion is that some degrees are less practical, it's still disrespectful and potentially sexist to dismiss someone's educational choices, especially when the person is a woman. This point might be the most damaging to the author's argument.\n\nThe daughter's reaction was emotional, but the author's comment about not being sexist and the daughter's accusation of sexism might relate to this point. By devaluing her field, the author is showing a bias that could be interpreted as sexist. Also, the author mentions the daughter is from a one-night stand, which might contribute to him treating her differently, which is not the daughter's fault. \n\nThe author argues that he's already paying child support, which the courts deemed appropriate, but the daughter might feel that's not enough. However, the author's treatment of the daughter versus the son, especially with the comment about the daughter's major, could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThe daughter's anger might be justified if the author is indeed showing preferential treatment based on gender or the validity of the major. The author's refusal to help the daughter could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the daughter is genuinely struggling, but the author's points about financial capability (daughter's mom can afford it) and the daughter's choice of major might be the key factors. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is treating his children differently, possibly due to his own biases (real vs. accidental child, gender, field of study). The daughter's accusation of sexism could be valid if the author is dismissing her education because it's a field that's often undervalued for women. \n\nOverall, while the author has financial reasons, the bias in his reasoning (especially point 5) and the differential treatment based on the daughter's background might make him the asshole. The daughter's anger is a reaction to feeling undervalued, which the author's comments about her major support.\n"
