I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is paying for his son's undergraduate education but refusing to help with his daughter's graduate school. The daughter is upset, feeling he favors his \"real\" family. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the reasons the author gives. He lists several points: he's paying child support for the daughter, which is court-ordered and significant; the son is going to a cheaper state school, while the daughter wants a more expensive private grad program; he already gave her a car, and the son received less; the daughter's mother is wealthier, so she can afford it, whereas the son's mother isn't doing as well financially; and the son's major is practical versus the daughter's \"useless\" degree.\n\nHmm. The author argues that he's contributing more to the daughter already via child support, so he doesn't want to pay extra for grad school. But he's also making distinctions based on the children's choices and the parents' financial situations. The daughter feels it's unfair, especially since he's helping the son. \n\nLegally, the child support is a court order, so he has to pay that. But paying for college or grad school isn't typically part of child support unless specified. So maybe he's under no obligation to help the daughter beyond the child support. However, the daughter might feel entitled because he's helping the son. The author's reasoning includes financial disparities between the children's families. The daughter's mom earns more, so perhaps he feels it's her responsibility. The son's mom earns less, so he steps in more there. \n\nBut the daughter is an adult now, going into grad school. She might be expected to take more responsibility for her own education. However, if the father has the means and chooses to help his son but not her, that could be seen as unfair. The daughter might feel that since he's a father to both, he should treat them equally. The author is making exceptions based on different factors, but the daughter perceives it as favoritism.\n\nThe author's point about the son's major being practical versus the daughter's \"useless\" degree is a bit problematic. That could come off as dismissive of her academic interests. Even if the daughter's field is less lucrative, it's still a valid choice. The author shouldn't judge her for that.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction was intense, but the author's refusal might have been communicated in a way that felt dismissive or disrespectful. He mentioned not appreciating her tone but didn't address her feelings of being less valued. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is prioritizing based on financial circumstances and practicality, but the daughter might see it as unequal treatment. The key issue is whether the father is obligated to provide financial support for his adult daughter's education. Since the daughter is an adult and the child support is already a legal obligation, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to pay for grad school when he's not doing the same for the son. However, the way he's handling it and the reasons he's using might be problematic. \n\nThe daughter is upset because she feels he cares more about his \"real\" family, implying that the author isn't her biological father. That adds another layer. The author stepped up as a father figure, so treating her differently might be seen as unfair. But he's also not her biological father, so maybe the expectations are different. \n\nOverall, the author's actions could be seen as not unfair if he's fulfilling his legal obligations and making decisions based on financial realities. However, the judgment based on the daughter's field of study and the perception of favoritism might make him the asshole. The daughter's anger is valid in feeling she's being treated less favorably, but the author has his own reasons. It's a tricky situation, but I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because he's fulfilling his child support and using financial reasoning, even if the communication could be better.\n"
