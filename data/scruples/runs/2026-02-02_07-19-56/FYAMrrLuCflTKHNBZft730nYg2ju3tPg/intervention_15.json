I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the person paying for their son's undergraduate education but not their daughter's graduate studies. The author explains several reasons, like child support already covering a significant portion for the daughter, the daughter attending a more expensive private school, the daughter receiving a car, and the daughter's mother's higher income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness from the daughter's perspective. Even though the author is paying child support, the daughter might feel that the author's financial support isn't enough, especially if the support is a legal obligation rather than an emotional or familial choice. The author mentions that they also have a son to support, but the key issue here is whether treating the children differently is justified.\n\nThe author's arguments: Child support is already a significant contribution. The daughter's mother is wealthier, so the author might not feel obligated to pay for grad school. The daughter chose a more expensive school, and the son's major is more practical. The author also gave the daughter a car, which the son didn't get. However, the daughter is upset because she feels it's unfair that the author is contributing more to the son's education despite having a higher income.\n\nBut from an outsider's view, even if the author is paying child support, that money is meant to support the child's basic needs, not necessarily education. If the daughter is seeking additional financial support for grad school, and the author is willing to help the son, that could be seen as preferential treatment. The author's reasoning about the son's major being more practical might be a way to justify the decision, but it's not a strong argument for fairness. Additionally, the author's response to the daughter's anger could be seen as dismissive, especially since the daughter felt disrespected.\n\nThe daughter's reaction, while perhaps over the top, stems from feeling neglected or less valued. The author's dismissal of her feelings as \"blowing it out of proportion\" might not address the underlying issue of perceived unfairness. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, treating children differently based on circumstances like birth parents or income of the other parent could be problematic. The key is whether the author is being consistent and fair in their support across both children.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author's decision is based on specific circumstances, but the way they handled the daughter's feelings and the potential inconsistency in support could place them in the wrong. However, there's also a counter-argument that the author's resources are limited and they have valid reasons. The line between fairness and personal choice is thin here. The daughter's resentment is real, and the author's response might not validate that. Hence, the author could be in the wrong for not addressing the daughter's feelings adequately, even if their financial decisions are defensible.\n"
