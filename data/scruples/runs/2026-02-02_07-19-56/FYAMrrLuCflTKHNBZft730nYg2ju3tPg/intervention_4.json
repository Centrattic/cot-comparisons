I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a father who's paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The daughter is upset about the perceived inequality, while the father lists several reasons for the difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was from a one-night stand and the father has been paying child support, which is court-mandated. He mentions he's contributing more to her through child support than his son. The son's mother has a lower income, so he's helping with his education. The daughter's mother is wealthier. Also, the author mentions the daughter's chosen field as \"something useless,\" which might imply bias.\n\nThe daughter feels disrespected when her request is denied, and their conversation ends poorly. The father apologizes for the tone but stands by his decision. The key points here are about fairness, the legal obligations, financial situations of both mothers, and the perception of favoritism. The father's reasoning includes financial contributions already via child support, the daughter's mother's ability to pay, and the differing practicality of the majors.\n\nHowever, treating children differently based on their parent's income or perceived usefulness of their majors can be seen as unfair. The child support is for the child's well-being, not education, so the father's refusal to cover grad school might be justified if he believes the mother can afford it. But the way he's handling it could be seen as dismissive, especially if the daughter feels unappreciated. The father's comment about the \"useless\" major might also contribute to the daughter's feeling of being undervalued.\n\nOn the other hand, he's providing for his son because of his wife's financial situation. The daughter's mother is more capable. The father is also giving different gifts (car vs. console), which adds to the perception of unequal treatment. The daughter's anger is understandable if she feels her needs are not being considered equally. The author might not be the asshole if his decisions are based on financial realities, but the way he communicates and the underlying attitudes (like dismissing the daughter's major) might make him seem unfair.\n"
