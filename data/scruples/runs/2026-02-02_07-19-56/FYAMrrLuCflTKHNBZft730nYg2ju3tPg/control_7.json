I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether it's fair to pay for a son's undergraduate education but not a daughter's graduate school. The author has a lot of reasons, but the daughter feels it's unfair.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and became a father to the daughter. He's been paying child support, which is legally mandated. The daughter is now asking for help with grad school, while the son is going to state school. The author argues that he's contributing more through child support, and that the daughter's mother is better off financially. \n\nThe daughter feels it's sexist because he's paying for the son but not her. The author says he's being fair because of the different circumstances. But does that make it fair? The daughter might feel that despite the different situations, she deserves equal support from her father. \n\nThe author mentions the son's practical major versus the daughter's \"useless\" one. That's a problematic point because it's judgmental and could be seen as biased. Also, the author called her a \"useless\" major\u2014maybe that's a reason for not supporting her, but it's not a valid argument. Education choices shouldn't be dismissed like that. \n\nThe author's reasoning about financial contributions through child support is a legal obligation, not necessarily a voluntary one. Just because he's paying it doesn't mean he's providing educational support. The daughter might feel that the child support isn't the same as direct educational funding. \n\nAlso, the daughter's outburst about being a sexist asshole is hurtful, but the author's response might have been dismissive. He might be failing to see that while his reasons are his own, the daughter feels neglected or less valued. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision is fair given the circumstances. If the daughter's mother can afford the education, maybe the author isn't obligated. But the daughter might feel that despite that, the father should still support her. However, the author isn't legally obligated to pay for her education beyond child support. \n\nThe daughter's accusation of sexism is a strong claim. The author is her father, so treating her differently could be seen as unfair, especially if the son is getting support. Even if the author has reasons, the perception of favoritism might make him the asshole. \n\nBut the author has valid points too. He's paying a significant amount via child support, which might cover some educational costs. The daughter's field choice could affect the author's willingness, but that's subjective. Also, the daughter's mom's higher income might mean the daughter can afford it more. \n\nIn the end, while the author has his reasons, the daughter's feelings of being treated unfairly and the author's dismissive attitude might mean he's in the wrong. The answer could be A (he is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut let me think again. The author isn't legally obligated to pay for college beyond child support. The daughter is asking for additional support, which he chooses not to give. His reasons include financial contributions through child support, which are mandatory, not optional. The daughter's mother's ability to pay doesn't negate the daughter's request for help. The author's judgment on her major is prejudicial and could contribute to the daughter feeling disrespected. \n\nThe author's actions might be legally justified, but ethically, treating the daughter differently could be seen as unfair. The daughter might feel she deserves equal consideration. So, maybe the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
