I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The situation involves a non-marital relationship, a daughter from that relationship, and a son from a current marriage. The author argues several reasons for not contributing to the daughter's education, like child support, financial disparities, different school costs, and the daughter's choice of major.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. The author is paying child support, which is a legal obligation, and that's already a significant contribution. The daughter's mother is financially stable, so maybe the author isn't obligated to pay for her education beyond that. The son's mother is less financially stable, so the author is helping to offset that. \n\nThen there's the issue of fairness between the children. The author is providing different things (car vs. games) and different amounts based on their situations. The daughter is upset because she feels she's being treated differently. But the author's reasons are based on financial realities and the children's own choices. \n\nThe daughter's reaction is intense, but does that mean the author is wrong? The author is making decisions based on their own resources and their children's circumstances. However, treating children differently can be seen as unfair, even if there are justifications. The key here is whether the author's actions were discriminatory. The author mentions the daughter's major as \"useless,\" which might imply bias towards certain fields, but that's subjective.\n\nLegally, the author isn't required to pay for the daughter's education beyond child support. The daughter's mother is supposed to cover those costs. The author is helping the son's family because they have a lower income. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nMorally, it's more complex. Parents often have to make tough decisions about financial support. The author is prioritizing based on need and their own resources. The daughter might feel unappreciated, but the author's actions are justified by their reasoning. The daughter's anger could also be due to feeling unsupported, but the author isn't obligated to meet all her requests. \n\nThe accusation of sexism is a strong one. The author is paying for their son's education but not the daughter's. However, the reasons given are based on financial and practical considerations rather than gender. The author isn't differentiating based on gender but on the specific circumstances of each child's education and family's ability to pay. The daughter's major being considered \"useless\" might be a point of contention, but that's more about the field of study than gender.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are justified by their reasoning and the financial contexts they've outlined. They are not acting out of malice or sexism but based on practical and financial considerations. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
