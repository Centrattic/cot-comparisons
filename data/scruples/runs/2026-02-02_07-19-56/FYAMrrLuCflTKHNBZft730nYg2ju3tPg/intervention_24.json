I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. \n\nFirst, the context: The author had a one-night stand resulting in a daughter. He stepped up as a father, pays child support, and now the daughter is upset he's paying for his son's undergrad but not her grad school. The author lists several reasons: child support is already significant, daughter's school is expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom is wealthy, and the son's major is practical.\n\nI need to consider fairness and consistency. The author is making different contributions to each child. The daughter feels this is unequal. The reasons given might be valid, but does that make it okay? The daughter is an adult now, so maybe she's responsible for her own grad school costs. However, the author's decision could be seen as favoring his biological son, which might come off as sexist, especially since he's a father to both. The daughter's anger might be justified if she expected equal support.\n\nAlso, the author's justification about the son's practical major versus the daughter's \"useless\" one could be a biased reason, which adds to the problem. The daughter might feel discriminated against based on gender or choice of field. The author's response to her anger was dismissive (\"maybe not the best choice of words\"), which could have hurt their relationship.\n\nIn terms of legal obligations, he's already paying child support for the daughter, so maybe there's an expectation of continued support. However, once the daughter is an adult, that obligation might not extend to grad school unless agreed otherwise. But emotionally, it's about parental support, not legalities.\n\nSo, the author might not be legally in the wrong, but ethically, he could be seen as inconsistent or biased, especially given the gender dynamics. The key is whether the treatment is fair. The author's reasons are valid, but the perception and the daughter's feelings matter too. The author might be in the right in his own mind, but the way it's handled could make him the asshole in the daughter's eyes. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because of the perceived sexism and inconsistent treatment, even if the reasons are understandable.\n"
