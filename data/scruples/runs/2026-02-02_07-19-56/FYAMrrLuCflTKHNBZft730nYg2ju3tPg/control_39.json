I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and his daughter is the result. He stepped up as a father, paying child support, which is significant. He's now being asked by his daughter to help with her grad school, but he's refusing. The daughter feels it's unfair since he's paying for his son's undergrad.\n\nLooking at the reasons he gave: he's already paying child support, which is more than the support he gives his son. The son is going to a cheaper state school, while the daughter's grad program is expensive. He bought her a car, and the son got a game console. The daughter's mom is wealthy, while the author's wife (son's mom) has a small business. The son is in a practical major, the daughter in a more abstract one.\n\nThe key points here are fairness, financial responsibility, and the motivations behind the support. The author is being criticized as sexist, but is he? He's providing for his son through his wife, and the daughter's mother can afford her education. The author might be prioritizing based on financial contributions already made (child support) and practicality of majors. However, treating children differently based on gender can be seen as unfair, even if the reasons are practical. Also, the daughter's reaction might be intense, but the author's refusal could be perceived as favoring his biological family. The line between financial responsibility and fairness is thin here. The fact that the author is paying child support already suggests he has a financial obligation to the daughter, but maybe not an obligation to fund her education beyond that. However, the daughter might feel entitled if her father is helping the son. The author's reasoning about the majors and the financial situations of the mothers could be valid, but the gender dynamic might still be a factor. The daughter's insult is extreme, but the author's decision to help the son and not the daughter might be seen as favoritism, even if based on other factors. So, is the author in the wrong? It's possible he's not, given the circumstances, but there's also a case to be made that treating children differently based on gender or other factors can be problematic. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making choices based on financial realities and existing obligations, but there's an argument for A (in the wrong) because of potential gender bias. But considering the details, the author's reasons are practical and not necessarily sexist. The daughter's mom is capable, and the son's mother is less so. So, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
