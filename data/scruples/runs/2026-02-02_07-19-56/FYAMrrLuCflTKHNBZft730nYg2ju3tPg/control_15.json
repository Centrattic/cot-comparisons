I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a one-night stand, got a woman pregnant, and became the father of a daughter. Now the daughter is graduating and wants help with grad school. The author is paying for his son's undergrad. He lists several reasons for not helping the daughter: child support is already significant, the daughter's school is expensive, he gave her a car instead, her mother is wealthy, and the son's major is practical.\n\nHmm, let's break down the key points. The daughter is upset because she feels unequal treatment. The author argues that he's contributing through child support and that his son's path is different. But is there a bias here?\n\nChild support is court-ordered, so maybe he's already contributing beyond his own choice. He mentions he tried to lower it but couldn't. But the daughter's education isn't covered by that support. So is it fair that he's not giving extra for her grad school? \n\nThe son's major is practical, which might lead to a stable job, while the daughter's is more about the author's perception of \"uselessness.\" That could be a bias. Also, the daughter's mother is wealthy, but maybe the author still has a responsibility to support both children fairly. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as favoring his biological family (his son, as the wife is his spouse but the daughter is from a different relationship). But the daughter is his child too. The author's justification about the car instead of college might not be equitable, especially if the son isn't getting similar support. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was harsh, but the author's reasoning could be seen as unequal treatment. Legally, he's meeting obligations, but morally, is he providing equal support? Maybe not. The author's own words about the daughter's major being \"useless\" could indicate a lack of respect for her choices, which is problematic. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily a bad person, the unequal treatment and underlying biases might make him the asshole here. He's not wrong in every aspect, but the way he's handling the situation shows favoritism and a lack of support for the daughter's educational goals. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
