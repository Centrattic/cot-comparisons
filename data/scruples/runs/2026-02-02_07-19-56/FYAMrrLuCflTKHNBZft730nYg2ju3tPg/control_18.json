I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father paying for his son's college but not his daughter's graduate school. The key points here are about fairness, the reasons provided, and the daughter's reaction.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand and became a parent to the daughter. He's been paying child support, which is legally mandated, and he's contributing more money to her than his son through that support. He's also given her a car, which is a significant expense. The daughter is now asking for help with grad school, which is expensive. The son is going to a state school, which is cheaper, and the father's wife (the son's mother) has a low income. The daughter's mother has a higher income, which might mean the daughter can afford her own education. The father also mentions the daughter's choice of major as a reason, implying he thinks it's not practical.\n\nThe father's reasons for not paying include financial contributions already made via child support, the cost difference between schools, prior gifts, the financial situations of the mothers, and the perceived impracticality of the daughter's major. The daughter feels it's sexist, thinking he favors his \"real\" family. The father says he didn't mean to show favoritism and thinks she's overreacting.\n\nNow, legal obligations aside, the ethical question is about fairness. The father is contributing through child support, which is a legal requirement, not necessarily a personal choice. The daughter might feel he should contribute more because he's a father, but legally, he's already doing that. The father is also helping his son's family, which is his actual spouse and child. The daughter's mother can afford to pay, so maybe the father isn't obligated. The major issue might be the daughter's perception of inequality. However, the father is giving different amounts for different things\u2014car vs. game console. That could be seen as unequal treatment, but it's not necessarily sexist if it's based on different circumstances. The daughter's reaction is strong, but the father is explaining his reasons logically. The key point is whether the father is being sexist or just making financial decisions based on practical reasons. The term \"sexist\" might be misapplied here if the differences in treatment are based on practical considerations rather than gender bias. However, treating children differently based on their parent's income or personal choices could be seen as unfair, but not necessarily sexist. The father might not be in the wrong if he's acting within his rights and considering the financial realities, but there could be an argument that he's not showing equal support. However, since the daughter's mother can afford to pay, the father's refusal might be justified. The daughter's anger might stem from feeling unappreciated, but the father's stance is based on existing contributions and practicality. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his reasons are based on financial and practical factors rather than gender bias.\n"
