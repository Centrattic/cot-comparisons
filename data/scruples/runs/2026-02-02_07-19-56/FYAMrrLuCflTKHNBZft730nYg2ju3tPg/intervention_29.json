I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The author has a daughter from a one-night stand and a son with his current wife. The daughter is upset because she feels he's favoring his \"real\" family.\n\nFirst, the author mentions paying child support for the daughter, which is a legal obligation, and he tried to get it lowered. So he's contributing financially, but maybe not in the form of college education. The daughter's mom is well-off, which complicates things. The author's wife, the son's mother, isn't doing as well financially, so he's helping with the son's education.\n\nThe daughter is now in grad school, which is expensive. The author points out differences in their financial situations and the types of schools they're attending. The son is going to a state school, which is cheaper, and has a practical major. The daughter is at a private school with a less practical major. The author also gave the daughter a car, which is a significant expense, and the son got a game console. \n\nThe daughter's reaction is intense, calling him a sexist and ending the conversation harshly. The author feels hurt and thinks she's overreacting. The key issue here is whether it's fair to treat the two children differently based on their financial needs and the circumstances of their upbringing.\n\nThe author argues that his support is based on practicality and financial necessity, while the daughter feels it's about favoritism. Legally, he's meeting his obligations through child support, but emotionally and ethically, there's a question of fairness. The daughter's mom's higher income might mean the daughter can afford her own grad school, which the author could see as her responsibility. However, the fact that the author is paying for his son's education despite his wife's lower income might be seen as unequal treatment, even if the son's situation is more financially strained.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own admission of contributing more to the daughter through the car, which the son didn't receive. This might make the daughter feel he's not being consistent. Also, the author's comment about her major being \"useless\" could be a factor in his decision, which might come off as dismissive of her choices.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might argue that a parent should treat all children fairly, regardless of the circumstances. Others might understand the financial and practical considerations. The daughter's emotional response is valid given her perspective, but the author's reasons are based on real financial differences. However, the way he communicated his refusal, especially the part about her major, might be seen as invalidating her choices, which could contribute to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's making decisions based on financial realities, but the daughter's feelings of being second-best are legitimate. The answer hinges on whether differential treatment based on financial need is justified versus perceived favoritism. Since the author is legally obligated to support the daughter and the daughter's mother is well-off, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not paying for grad school beyond his child support. However, the fact that he's paying for the son's undergrad while the daughter is expected to handle her own grad school could still be seen as unequal treatment. The key is whether the author's actions are fair considering all circumstances, but the daughter's reaction might be partly due to feeling neglected or less valued. Ultimately, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's acting within his financial judgments, but there's a case to be made for A due to the emotional impact and inequality in treatment.\n"
