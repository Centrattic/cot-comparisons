I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the daughter is about to finish undergrad and planning for grad school. She asked the father for help, but he refused. He lists several reasons. Let's break them down.\n\n1. He pays child support, which is a court-ordered amount. The courts made him contribute a significant amount, and he's actually paying more for the daughter than the son. That's a point in his favor, but does that mean he's obligated to pay for her education beyond that?\n\n2. The daughter's grad school is expensive (private, $30k+ a year), while the son is going to a cheaper state school. The father is considering the son's choice as practical, but the daughter's as \"useless.\" This seems a bit problematic. Degrees in fields like gender or black studies can be valuable, even if they're not traditional STEM fields. It's possible he's undervaluing her choices, which might be a bias.\n\n3. He gave the daughter a car when she graduated high school, while the son got a game console. The car was a personal expense, which shows he's provided for her in other ways. But the daughter is now asking for more. Maybe he's already given other support, but grad school is a different matter.\n\n4. The daughter's mom earns a high salary, so she can afford her education. The son's mom (his current wife) has a lower income. Here, the father is differentiating between the two mothers' financial situations. But is that fair? Should a parent's financial contribution to their child's education depend on the other parent's income? It might be seen as a cop-out, especially if the daughter's mom is unwilling to pay despite her ability to do so. The father could argue he's already meeting his legal obligations, but maybe people would see it as an opportunity to help his daughter if he can afford it, regardless of her mother's income.\n\n5. The son's major is practical (Computer Science), while the daughter's is considered \"useless.\" This seems to be a key point. The father's judgment about the usefulness of her major could be a form of bias. It's possible that he's prioritizing his son's education because of the major, which might be sexist or just a personal preference. However, the fact that he's already paying for his son's undergrad doesn't necessarily mean he has to do the same for his daughter's grad school, unless he's been consistent in his support.\n\nNow, the daughter reacted strongly, calling him a sexist asshole. The father feels this is an overreaction. The emotional part is important here. The daughter might feel neglected or that her education isn't valued. The father's comment about \"real family\" could imply that the daughter isn't part of his real family, which is a sensitive issue. Even if he didn't mean it that way, the words might have been hurtful.\n\nThe father's reasons are somewhat legitimate, like child support and the other parent's income. But his justification based on the daughter's major being \"useless\" is a red flag. It's possible that he's projecting his own values onto his children, which might not be fair. Also, the fact that he gave the daughter a car but not the son might be seen as favoritism in reverse, but he might say it's because the son is a teenager and doesn't need a car yet. However, the daughter is now in grad school, which is a different scenario.\n\nThe other parent's income is a factor in child support, but if the father has the means to help both children, he might be expected to do so. The daughter's argument is that he's paying for his son's undergrad, so she expects similar support for her grad school. The father's refusal could be seen as double standard if he's willing to support a child from his current marriage but not a child from a previous relationship. But maybe he's already contributing more through child support.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the daughter feeling disrespected. The father's response about not being a bank and the daughter's anger might both be valid. The daughter is in a vulnerable position, asking for support, and the father's tone could have been harsh. The phrase \"real family\" is particularly hurtful and might reinforce the idea that she's less of a family member, which could be a key point in determining if he's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might argue that parents should support all their children equally, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say that child support is sufficient, and it's up to the father to decide how to allocate extra funds. However, the daughter's perception that he's favoring his \"real\" family (possibly the son) could indicate underlying biases or unfair treatment.\n\nThe \"useless\" comment about her major is definitely a problem. It's devaluing her choice and might reflect personal prejudices. That could contribute to the daughter feeling mistreated. Additionally, the father might be conflating his legal obligations (child support) with his personal choice to help with education, which are separate.\n\nSo, the main issues are the perceived favoritism, the devaluation of the daughter's chosen field, and the hurtful language used. Even if the father has valid financial reasoning, the way he communicated and the biases he expressed could make him the asshole. The daughter's emotional response, while intense, might stem from feeling unappreciated or undervalued. The father's \"real family\" comment is especially damaging because it implies that the daughter isn't as important, which is a strong indicator of being in the wrong.\n"
