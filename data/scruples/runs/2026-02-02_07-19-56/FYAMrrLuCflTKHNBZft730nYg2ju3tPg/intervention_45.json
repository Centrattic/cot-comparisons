I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The author has a daughter from a one-night stand and a son from his current marriage. He's facing backlash from the daughter for not contributing to her education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he provided. He mentions child support, which is court-mandated and significant. He's already contributing more to the daughter's support through that. The daughter wants him to pay for grad school, which is expensive, while the son is going to a state school. The author also gave the daughter a car, which was a big expense, showing he's invested in her in non-educational ways. The daughter's mother is wealthy, so she can afford her education, whereas the author's wife has a modest income, making it harder to support the son. Also, the son's major is practical, which might be a factor in the author's decision.\n\nThe daughter accused him of caring more about his \"real\" family, implying he's being unfair. The author claims he supports her academically but isn't a bank. The daughter's reaction was intense, even calling him a sexist asshole. The key points here are fairness, financial responsibility, and parental bias.\n\nIs it fair to pay one child and not the other? The author has a legal obligation to support the daughter via child support, which is already substantial. The daughter is now asking for additional support for grad school, which is beyond basic needs. The son's education is being covered by the author's wife, who has limited income, which might explain why the author is covering his son's costs. The daughter's mother can afford her education, so the author might feel less obligated to contribute further. \n\nHowever, treating children differently based on their parents or financial situations could be seen as unfair. The author might be prioritizing his current family, but the daughter feels neglected. The fact that the daughter is from a different mother might lead to perceived favoritism. The author's justification about practical vs. \"useless\" majors is problematic because it's a value judgment about the worth of different degrees and could be seen as discriminatory or condescending.\n\nThe daughter's anger is understandable if she feels she's being treated less favorably. The author's dismissal of her feelings by labeling her reaction as overreacting might exacerbate the issue. The argument that he's not a bank is valid, but parents often adjust support based on their children's needs and circumstances. The key is whether the author's decision is based on fair and consistent reasoning. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision might not be entirely wrong, but his communication and the reasons he gave (like the major judgment) could be problematic. The daughter's feelings are valid if she feels unfairly treated. However, the author is within his rights to decide how to allocate his resources, especially since the daughter's mother is financially capable. The question is whether the author's actions are morally wrong, not legally. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid points about financial contributions and differing circumstances, his approach might come across as biased or dismissive. The answer hinges on whether perceived favoritism and judgmental attitudes make him the asshole. The daughter's emotional response is intense, but the author's justifications have merit. I'm leaning towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the value judgment on the daughter's major and the potential for perceived favoritism, but there's a counterargument for B (not in the wrong) due to financial realities.\n"
