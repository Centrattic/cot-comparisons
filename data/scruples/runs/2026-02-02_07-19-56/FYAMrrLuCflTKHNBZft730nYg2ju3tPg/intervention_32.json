I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The situation is a bit complicated with a one-night stand leading to a daughter, and now the daughter is upset he's not helping with her grad school when he's helping her half-brother.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he pays child support for the daughter, which is a court-ordered obligation. He also points out that he gave her a car, which cost $12k, and he's supporting his son's education at a state school. The son's major is practical, while the daughter's is considered less so. The daughter's mom is wealthier, and the author's wife (son's mother) has a low income.\n\nThe daughter accused him of caring more about his \"real\" family. The author feels this is a misinterpretation and that he's being sexist when he's trying to be fair based on financial contributions and other factors. The key points here are the financial responsibilities, the court-mandated support, and the differing educational choices.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reasoning justifies not helping the daughter with grad school. The fact that he's already paying child support, which is a legal obligation, might mean he's already contributing significantly. However, the daughter's request is for additional support for grad school, which may not be a legal obligation. The author's argument is that his contributions are already more than for the son, especially considering the child support amount. Also, the daughter's mother is financially capable, which might shift some responsibility there.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter might feel that since the author is helping the son, he should help her as well, especially given the significant cost difference between the schools. The author's mention of the daughter's major as \"useless\" could be a sensitive point, as it might imply he's undervaluing her choice, which could contribute to her feeling disrespected. His response that he isn't a bank and that his money is his own could be seen as dismissive, especially if he's willing to help the son.\n\nThe daughter's emotional reaction is understandable if she feels discriminated against. The author's use of the term \"real family\" might be triggering, even if it wasn't his intention. The question is whether his actions are justified based on the given reasons or if they're discriminatory. The financial aspects are a valid consideration, but the way he frames it might come off as unfair or biased.\n\nIn some cases, parents might choose to support children differently based on circumstances. However, the daughter could argue that the author is showing favoritism by helping the son but not her, especially since he's already paying a significant amount in child support. The key here is whether the author's reasons are genuinely about financial capability and circumstances or if there's an underlying bias towards his \"real\" family (the son's mother's family). The author's wife's lower income might also play a role in his decision, but that could be seen as a way to justify unequal treatment.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong if his decisions are based on favoring one child over another without legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. The fact that the daughter's mother is financially stable could mean the author isn't providing enough support despite being able to contribute. However, the legal obligation of child support is a strong factor in his favor. The conflict arises from the perception of fairness, and the author's handling of the situation might have been insensitive, leading to the daughter's hurtful response. So, while there are justifications, the way he's communicated his decision and the underlying biases (like calling the major \"useless\") might make him the asshole.\n"
