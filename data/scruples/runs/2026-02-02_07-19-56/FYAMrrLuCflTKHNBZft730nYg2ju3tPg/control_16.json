I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a father who is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate studies. He has several reasons listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The daughter feels she's being treated unfairly because her father is helping her half-brother but not her. The father lists several justifications: he pays child support which is higher than his son's support, the schools' costs differ, he already gave her a car while the son got a game console, the daughter's mother is financially stable, and the son's major is more practical.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support is determined by the courts and is supposed to cover the child's needs. The father is fulfilling his obligation through child support, which might mean he's already contributing adequately. However, the daughter's mother is the primary caregiver and has a higher income, which could imply she's more capable of covering educational expenses. \n\nFinancial differences between the two children's educations are a factor. The daughter's grad school is more expensive, which might be a legitimate reason for the father not wanting to fund it, especially if he's not the primary caregiver. The father also mentions the practicality of the son's major versus the daughter's, which could be a biased viewpoint, as the value of a degree can be subjective. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was intense, calling him sexist, which might be an overreaction, but her feelings of being undervalued are valid. The father's response of telling her to enjoy his \"real family\" was hurtful. The communication breakdown here is significant. Even if the father has reasons, his approach could be seen as dismissive. \n\nHowever, the father is within his rights to decide how to allocate his money, especially since he's not the primary caregiver for the daughter. The daughter's mother is the one handling day-to-day care and has the resources. So, while there might be emotional issues, legally and financially, the father isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nBut there's an ethical angle. The daughter might feel that as a parent, he should support both children equally. However, the father's contributions through child support and other gifts might be considered adequate. The key is whether the father's actions are discriminatory or based on valid financial considerations. \n\nIn conclusion, while the daughter's feelings are understandable, the father's actions aren't necessarily wrong given the circumstances. He's providing child support, which is a legal requirement, and the daughter's mother is financially capable. The father's decision to not pay for grad school, especially considering the cost difference and the mother's ability, is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong.\n"
