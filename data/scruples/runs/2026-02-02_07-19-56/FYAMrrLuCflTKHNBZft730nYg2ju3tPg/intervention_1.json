I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The author provided several reasons.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand and the daughter was born from that. He didn't want the baby but stepped up as a father. Now the daughter is upset because he's helping her brother but not her. The author lists reasons like child support already covering her undergrad, the difference in school costs, giving her a car, the mother's higher income, and the son's major being more practical.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and the reasons given. Child support is a legal obligation, so he's already contributing. But the daughter is now in grad school, which is an additional expense. He's paying for his son's undergrad, which is a different financial situation. The son's mother has a lower income, so maybe the author is helping out more there. But the daughter's mom is well-off, so the author might feel it's her responsibility. \n\nThe daughter's perspective is that she's being treated differently. The author says he didn't want to keep the baby, which complicates the situation. However, once he stepped up as a father, is it fair to treat the children differently based on circumstances? The argument here is whether the author's reasons are valid. The term \"real family\" from the daughter's side is a red flag. The author might be seen as favoring the son because he's part of the \"real family,\" which is a problematic notion. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the daughter's major as \"useless,\" which could be a bias. Even if he thinks it's a less practical major, that's his opinion and doesn't necessarily justify not supporting her. The way he handled the conversation might have come off as dismissive, especially after she got upset. \n\nSo, while there are some justifications, treating children differently based on their parentage or the mother's income might be seen as unfair. The daughter's feelings of being less loved because of being from a different mother could be hurtful. The author's response might not have addressed her emotional concerns, leading to the conflict. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because the reasons given don't fully address the emotional aspect and the potential for perceived favoritism. Even if there are financial justifications, the way he's handling it might not be fair to the daughter, especially considering he's already contributing through child support and other means.\n"
