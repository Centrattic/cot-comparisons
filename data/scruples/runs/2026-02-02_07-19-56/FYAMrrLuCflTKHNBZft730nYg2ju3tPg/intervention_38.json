I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The author has a daughter from a one-night stand, stepped up as a father, and pays child support. His daughter is now asking for help with grad school, but he's refusing and giving several reasons.\n\nFirst, the reasons he lists: he pays child support which is significant, the daughter's grad school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, the mother can afford her education, and the son's major is practical. The daughter feels he's showing favoritism, calling him a sexist. The author is defensive, saying he's not a bank and she's overreacting.\n\nI need to consider if his reasoning is fair. Paying child support is a legal obligation, but is that enough? The daughter might see the support as just covering basic needs, not education. The author's son and daughter are different in terms of expenses and majors. The author's wife has a low income, but the daughter's mother is well-off. Maybe the author feels he's contributing enough through support, but the daughter might expect more since he's paying for his son. \n\nHowever, treating the children differently could be seen as unfair, even if the financial situations differ. The daughter's anger might be because she feels unequal treatment. The author's response, telling her to \"fuck off\" after she's upset, could be part of the problem. Even if he feels justified, the way he reacted might have been harsh. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just the reaction. \n\nThe key is whether it's wrong to pay for one child's education but not the other. The author's reasons are based on financial capability and practicality, but the daughter's argument is about fairness. Depending on cultural or personal values, some might say it's okay to prioritize based on need and practicality, others might see it as favoritism. The author might be in the right if he's acting within his means and considering each child's situation, but he's in the wrong if he's being unfair or dismissive of his daughter's feelings. The text says he's a civil engineer with a decent salary, so maybe he can afford to help both? Or the daughter's mother's income is a factor. The author's son is with his wife who has a low income, so maybe he's helping there because she can't afford it. The daughter's mother can afford it, so maybe he's not helping her. That could be a valid distinction. But the daughter might feel he's still obligated as a father. \n\nThe author's argument that he's not a bank and his money is his might be valid, but the daughter's perspective is that he's showing preferential treatment. The author's own admission that he's not paying for the daughter's undergrad (only a car) and now grad school might be seen as inconsistent. The daughter's major being \"useless\" is a judgment call, which might add to the perception of bias. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the differences in treatment are justified. If the reasons are based on financial responsibility and real needs, maybe not. But if he's being unfair or dismissive of his daughter's needs, then yes. The answer could be B, not in the wrong, because he's considering different factors and his own resources. But some might argue A because of the potential for unfairness. Since the user's initial thought is A, but I need to make a balanced assessment. The author's points are valid, but the way he handled the situation (the harsh response and the daughter's hurt feelings) might not be. However, the question is about being in the wrong for the decision, not the reaction. So, if his reasons are sound, then B. If they're not, then A.\n"
