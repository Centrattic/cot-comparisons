I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a father who had a one-night stand and became a father to a daughter. He's been paying child support for her, which is a legal obligation. Now, his daughter is upset because he's paying for his son's undergrad but not her grad school. The father lists several reasons: he's already paying a significant amount in child support, the daughter wants an expensive private grad program, he already gave her a car, her mother is wealthy, and her major is considered \"useless\" compared to his son's practical major.\n\nHmm. The key points here are fairness, parental responsibility, and the daughter's perception of favoritism. The father argues that he's contributing more to the daughter through child support, but the daughter feels he's being unfair. The father is also concerned about the cost difference between the son's state school and the daughter's private grad school. But is it fair to differentiate based on the child's choices? Also, the daughter's major being deemed \"useless\" by the father seems like a value judgment that might not be fair to her.\n\nThe father mentions that he's not paying for the daughter's undergrad, relying on the mother, who is wealthy, and the son's mother is less financially stable. He's trying to support the son's practical major, which could lead to a better job. But is it right to judge the daughter's academic choices and withhold support? Also, the daughter's reaction was strong, but the father's response might have been dismissive, which could hurt the relationship.\n\nLegally, the father is meeting his obligations with child support. However, emotionally and ethically, the situation is complex. The father's decision to prioritize one child over the other might be seen as unfair, especially since both are his children. The daughter's anger stems from feeling unappreciated and overlooked. The father's reasons are valid in terms of financial considerations, but the way he framed his son's major as \"practical\" versus the daughter's as \"useless\" shows a bias that could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, parents are often expected to treat all their children equally as much as possible. The father's actions might be seen as favoritism, especially if the daughter feels he's not supporting her future adequately. Also, the father's comment about the daughter's major could be discriminatory, implying that certain fields are less valuable, which isn't a fair assessment.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the father has legitimate financial arguments, but the way he's treating his daughter's choices and the potential favoritism in support might make him the asshole. The daughter's reaction is extreme, but the father's reasoning includes judgments that could be considered unfair. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the discriminatory attitudes and not treating both children equitably despite financial constraints.\n"
