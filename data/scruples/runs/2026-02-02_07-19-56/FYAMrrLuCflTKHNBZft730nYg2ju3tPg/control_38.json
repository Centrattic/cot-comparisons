I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. The author provides several reasons, like child support already covering the daughter, the daughter's mom being wealthy, the daughter's choice of an expensive private school, and the son's more practical major. \n\nFirst, the author got into a one-night stand and didn't want the child, but stepped up as a father. Now, the daughter is upset because he's helping her half-brother but not her. The author argues that he's already contributing through child support, which is a legal obligation, and that the daughter's mom can afford it. But does that absolve him of supporting his daughter's education? Maybe not, because child support is for general needs, not necessarily education beyond that. \n\nThen, there's the argument about the son's more practical major versus the daughter's field of study. That sounds like a bias against certain fields, which could be problematic. Also, the daughter's reaction was harsh, but the author's response might have been dismissive. He called her a \"sexist asshole,\" which is a strong term and could have been hurtful. However, the daughter's initial accusations might have been unfair.\n\nThe key points are fairness between children, the role of parents in higher education, and whether the author's reasons are justifiable. Legally, he's meeting his child support obligations, but morally, is it right to prioritize one child over another? The author also gave the daughter a car, which is a significant gift, but that's different from funding education. \n\nThe daughter's mom's income versus the wife's income might play a role; if the daughter's mom can afford it, maybe the author isn't obligated. However, the author might still feel a responsibility as a father. The fact that the author is a civil engineer with a good salary means he can afford to help both, but he's not, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nThe daughter's major choice being called \"useless\" is a value judgment that's problematic. The author's reasoning here might be biased, implying that certain fields aren't valuable, which isn't true. That could contribute to the daughter feeling undervalued. \n\nOverall, while the author has his reasons, the question is whether those reasons are valid enough to justify the treatment of the daughter. The daughter's reaction was extreme, but the author's response might have been dismissive. The core issue is whether the author is being fair and supportive as a parent. Considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for prioritizing the son over the daughter, even with his justifications, and for making judgments about the daughter's field of study.\n"
