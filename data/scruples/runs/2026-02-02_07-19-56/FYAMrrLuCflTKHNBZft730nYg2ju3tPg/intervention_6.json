I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The author explains that the daughter was from a one-night stand and he's paying child support. He lists several reasons, like the daughter's mother is wealthy, the daughter chose an expensive school, and the son's major is more practical. \n\nHmm, first, the situation is that the daughter is about to finish undergrad and wants help with grad school. The author isn't paying for her undergrad but is paying for his son's undergrad. The daughter feels this is unfair because he's helping the son. The author argues he's already paying child support, which is significant, and that the daughter's mother can afford it. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are discriminatory. He's treating the two children differently, which might be seen as unequal treatment. The daughter is his legal child, and the son is from his current marriage. But the fact that he's paying child support and the daughter's mother can afford her education complicates things. \n\nThe author mentions that the daughter wants to study a \"useless\" field, but that's his own bias. Also, the daughter has already received a car, while the son got a game console. That's a big difference in support. However, the child support he's paying is court-ordered, so maybe he's fulfilling his duty there. \n\nThe daughter's reaction was intense, but the author's refusal might be perceived as favoring his biological son. However, the author is not the daughter's parent; he's a stepfather. But legally, he's the father. The key issue is whether he's being fair. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes financial and practical considerations, like the daughter's mother's higher income. But the daughter might feel his support is conditional based on her choices. The author's dismissal of her field of study could be a point against him. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is providing different levels of support based on arbitrary reasons (like field of study), that's problematic. Also, the daughter has been raised by him since birth, so treating her differently from the son could be seen as unfair, especially if the son is from a different relationship. \n\nThe daughter's anger makes sense if she feels he's shown support in the past (like the car) but not now. The author's refusal might be seen as not fully taking responsibility for her education, even though he's paying child support. However, child support is a legal obligation, not necessarily for educational expenses beyond what's ordered.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The author is making decisions that affect his daughter's education, which could be seen as discriminatory. Even if he has valid reasons, the way he's handling it might not be fair. The fact that he's using the daughter's mother's wealth as a reason might not be his decision to make. Also, the author's comment about the \"useless\" degree is judgmental and could contribute to the daughter feeling devalued. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the daughter's perspective and for treating her differently without a justifiable reason beyond what's legally required. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
