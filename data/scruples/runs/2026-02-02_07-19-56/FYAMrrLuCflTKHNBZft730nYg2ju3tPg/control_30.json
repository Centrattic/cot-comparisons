I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The daughter feels he's unfair and that he cares more about his \"real\" family, meaning his wife and son. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the reasons he gives. He mentions child support, which he's already paying a significant amount for the daughter. So he's contributing money through legal means. Then, there's the difference in their schools' costs: the daughter's grad school is more expensive than the son's undergrad. He also points out that he gave the daughter a car, while the son got a game console. The daughter's mom is wealthy, while the son's mom has a low income. Lastly, the son is in a practical major, while the daughter's is considered \"useless\" by the author.\n\nHmm. The key points here are fairness and consistency. The author is treating two children differently, even though he's both their father. The daughter feels this is unfair. Let's break down the arguments.\n\nChild support is a legal obligation, but he's already paying a significant amount. However, the daughter is in grad school now, so maybe that support isn't covering her education. The author is paying for his son's undergrad, which might be part of the child support for him? Or is the son's education separate from child support? Since the son's mother has a low income, maybe the author is supplementing beyond child support for the son. \n\nThe daughter's mom has a high salary, which the author mentions, but he's still contributing money for the daughter through child support. However, the daughter is asking for additional help for grad school, which he's refusing. The author is taking a stance that his money is his own and that he's not a bank. But does he have a responsibility to help both children equally, regardless of their parents' incomes?\n\nAlso, the daughter's major is criticized as \"useless.\" That's a subjective judgment and could be seen as dismissive of her interests or career goals. Even if the author doesn't agree with her choice, is it fair to use that as a reason to withhold financial support?\n\nThe daughter called him sexist, which is a strong accusation. The author says he didn't mean it that way, but treating a daughter and son differently in financial support could be seen as sexist, especially if the reasons aren't valid or if there's a double standard. For example, if he were to pay for a son's grad school but not a daughter's under similar circumstances, that would be a clear bias. However, in this case, the son is in undergrad while the daughter is in grad school, which might be different scenarios.\n\nAnother angle: the author gave the daughter a car, which was a significant expense, while the son got a console. That might reflect his own bias, contributing more to the daughter. Now, when the daughter asks for help, he's less willing, possibly because he feels he's already given her more. But the daughter's grad school is a different expense. If the son's undergrad is part of his responsibility, does the daughter's grad school fall under his duty as well?\n\nThe daughter's mom is able to afford her education, so maybe the author feels less obligation. But if the daughter is asking for help, regardless of the mother's income, the father's decision to help or not could be seen as a personal choice. However, the daughter might feel that since the father is paying for the son, he should do the same for her, even if the mother can afford it.\n\nThe author's response to the daughter's anger might have been harsh, calling her disrespectful. But the daughter's reaction was also strong, using expletives. Still, the core issue is whether the author's decision to pay for the son and not the daughter is fair.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is making a choice based on various factors, but the perception of fairness is crucial. Even if his reasons seem logical to him, treating children differently can lead to feelings of favoritism. If the author is paying for the son because of the son's mother's lower income, but the daughter's mother is wealthy, that might be a valid economic reason. However, the daughter's argument that the author cares more about his \"real\" family implies a deeper issue of favoritism based on marital status or biological ties, which could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on whether his actions are discriminatory. If he's treating the daughter unfairly without just cause, then yes. But if his decisions are based on financial responsibilities and the children's circumstances, then no. The problem arises if there's a pattern of favoritism without valid reasons. The author's criticism of the daughter's major as \"useless\" and the previous gift of a car to the daughter might suggest inconsistency, as he's given her more in the past. Also, the fact that he's paying child support for the daughter might mean he's already contributing more in that aspect, but not in education.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has his reasons, the way he's treating the daughter differently could be seen as unfair, especially if the criteria for support aren't consistently applied. The daughter's feeling of being treated as less important because she's from a different family might stem from the author's underlying biases. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if his actions are rooted in favoritism rather than objective financial considerations.\n"
