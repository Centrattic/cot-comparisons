I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who is paying for his son's college but not his daughter's graduate school. He explains that the daughter is from a one-night stand, and he's been paying child support for her, which he feels is a significant contribution. The daughter is upset and accuses him of favoring his \"real\" family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's reasons. He lists several points: he pays child support, the daughter's school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, the daughter's mother can afford it, and the son's major is more practical. The daughter feels he's being sexist or favoring his other family. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, even if the daughter is from a different mother, the father is her parent and has a responsibility. The fact that he pays child support might not equate to educational support. The daughter might feel entitled to the same level of support, especially if she's not aware of the financial contributions in different forms. The father's decision to give a car versus a game console could seem unequal. Also, the daughter's emotional reaction is valid because children often expect equal treatment from parents, regardless of the circumstances of their birth.\n\nThe father's reasoning about practicality versus \"useless\" majors might be a sensitive area. It could come off as dismissive of her academic choices, which might contribute to her feeling undervalued. The argument about the mother's income versus the wife's might be a point in his favor, but the daughter might feel that the father should still contribute, especially if the mother isn't doing so. \n\nHowever, the father is making a conscious choice based on his own financial considerations and past contributions. He might feel he's being fair by considering different factors. But from the daughter's perspective, it's about perceived inequality. The key here is whether the father's actions are discriminatory or just a matter of differing circumstances. \n\nThe daughter's anger and the father's defensive response might indicate a breakdown in communication rather than a clear right or wrong. But the father's refusal to support her grad school despite paying for his son's education could be seen as favoritism, especially if the daughter feels her needs are comparable. The term \"sexist\" might be too strong, but the accusation of favoring his \"real\" family could imply that he's not treating her as equally important. \n\nConsidering all angles, while the father has his reasons, the daughter's feelings of being undervalued are valid. The father's decision might be seen as unfair, even if the reasons are logical. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not treating both children equally despite the circumstances.\n"
