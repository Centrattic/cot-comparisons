I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the father is paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. He has several reasons: he pays child support, the daughter's school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom is wealthy, and the son's major is more practical. The daughter feels he's being unfair and called him sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and moral obligations. The father is legally required to pay child support for the daughter, which is a significant amount. The son's mother isn't earning much, so he's helping there. But the daughter's mom is well-off. Legally, he might not have an obligation to pay for the daughter's grad school beyond child support.\n\nThen, the financial aspects. He's contributing more through child support than he does for the son's college. The daughter's grad program is more expensive. He also gave her a car, which is a big expense. The son is going to a cheaper school, which might mean the father's contribution is more manageable there.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is strong\u2014calling him sexist and cutting off communication. But the father argues that his reasons are practical. The daughter's field of study is mentioned as \"useless,\" which is a bit judgmental, but he's not obligated to fund that. Also, the daughter's mom can afford to pay, so maybe it's not his responsibility.\n\nHowever, the father is treating the two children differently, which might be seen as unfair. Even if he's paying child support, contributing to education differently could be a point of contention. The daughter might feel he's showing preferential treatment by helping the son's education more, especially if the son's major is considered more practical. But the father is justifying it based on financial feasibility and the daughter's mother's ability to pay.\n\nAnother angle: The father is a single parent for the son, while the daughter has a mother who is financially stable. The father might be trying to balance his resources between two families. But the daughter's argument is that she's not getting the same support. Is it fair to treat them differently because of the circumstances of their marriages?\n\nAlso, the father's last comment about the daughter blowing it out of proportion and her response being emotional. But the daughter's frustration is understandable given the discrepancy. He might not be in the wrong, but there's room for empathy here. The key is whether his reasons are justifiable.\n\nLegally, he's not required to pay for the daughter's education beyond child support. Morally, some might argue that as a father, he should treat both children equally, but others might see his financial constraints and the daughter's mother's responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all points, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because his actions are based on legal obligations and financial practicality. But there's a nuance where treating children differently can cause hurt feelings, even if it's not legally required. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong, and given his explanations, the answer leans towards B.\n"
