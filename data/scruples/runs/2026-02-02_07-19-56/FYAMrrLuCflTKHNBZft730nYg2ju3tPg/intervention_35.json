I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the father had a one-night stand and became a father to a daughter. He's been paying child support, which is significant. The daughter is now asking for help with grad school, which is expensive. The father has several reasons: he's already paying child support, the daughter's school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, her mother can afford it, and the son's major is more practical.\n\nThe key points here are fairness, consistency, and the reasons given. The father is treating his two children differently. The daughter feels discriminated against, especially since the father is paying for the son's education. The father argues that he's contributing more through child support, but the daughter might see that as separate from educational support. Also, the son's major is considered practical, which might influence the father's decision, potentially showing bias.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is strong, but the father's refusal could be seen as favoring his \"real\" family, which is problematic. Even if the reasons are valid, treating children differently without clear, fair justification can be seen as unfair. The father's explanation about the son's major being more practical might imply he's valuing certain careers over others, which isn't fair. Also, the fact that the daughter's mother earns more but the father is still expected to contribute might not be a valid reason to withhold support.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the father can afford to help both, not helping the daughter could be seen as sexist or biased, especially since the son isn't his biological child. The father's own statement that he's part of the \"real\" family suggests a bias that's harmful. Even if the financials are different, the emotional impact of favoring one child over another can be damaging. The daughter's anger is justified if she feels she's being treated as less important.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the father is treating his children unequally without a fair and consistent rationale. Even if the reasons seem logical to him, the impact on the daughter's perception of fairness and parental support is significant. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
