I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. The situation involves a one-night stand leading to a daughter, and the author stepping up as a father. Now the daughter is upset that he's paying for his son's education but not hers, and he's listing his reasons.\n\nFirst, the author is paying child support for his daughter, which is significant. But he's also paying for his son's college. The daughter feels it's unfair that he's not contributing to her grad school. The author argues that his son's education is more practical, his daughter's grad school is expensive, and he's already given her a car. Also, the daughter's mother has a higher income. \n\nHmm. The key points here are the unequal treatment and the reasons behind it. The author is a civil engineer with a decent salary. He's paying child support for the daughter, which is court-ordered, but he's also using his own money for the son's education. The daughter is now in grad school, which costs a lot. The author's reasoning includes the cost difference between private and state schools, the practicality of majors, and the financial situations of the respective mothers.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is treating the two children differently based on various factors. But is that justifiable? The daughter might feel that despite the court-ordered support, the father has a responsibility to contribute to her education as he does for his son. The author might argue that the child support covers the daughter's needs, but the daughter is now seeking additional support for grad school, which isn't part of the child support calculation in many places. \n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction is strong, but the author's response could come off as dismissive. He mentions not wanting to be a bank, which could imply that financial support is a privilege rather than a right. However, the daughter might see it as a parental duty to support both children's education regardless of the circumstances of their birth. \n\nThe author's reasons include the daughter's choice of a more expensive school and a \"useless\" major. That seems like a judgment call, which could be seen as disrespectful. The father's comparison between his son's practical major and his daughter's choice might contribute to her feeling undervalued. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical obligations, child support is typically for the child's basic needs and upbringing until a certain age. College education isn't always covered unless agreed upon. The author might not have a legal obligation to pay for his daughter's college, especially since he's already paying child support. However, ethically, if he has the means, some might argue he should support both children equally. \n\nThe way the author handled the conversation might be problematic. Dismissing the daughter's feelings and calling her a \"real family\" might be hurtful. The daughter's anger is understandable if she feels unfairly treated. The author's reasons might be valid in terms of financial practicality, but the emotional aspect is important too. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider fairness and emotional impact, maybe. If we look at legal obligations and financial circumstances, maybe not. But the question is whether he's in the wrong regardless of legal aspects. The daughter might feel wronged because of unequal treatment, even if the reasons are practical. The author's justification might not fully address the daughter's feelings of being valued less. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether parental support should be equal regardless of circumstances. If the author is choosing to support one child's education over another, even with reasons, it could be seen as unfair. But the financial and practical reasons might mitigate that. However, the emotional harm caused by the author's response and the judgment on the daughter's major choice could tip the scales. The daughter's reaction might be intense, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn the end, the author might be in the wrong because he's treating the children unequally and contributing to the daughter's feelings of being less valued. The reasons are valid in a practical sense, but the emotional and ethical aspects are important too.\n"
