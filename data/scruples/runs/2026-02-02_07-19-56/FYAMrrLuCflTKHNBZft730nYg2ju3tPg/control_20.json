I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for paying for their son's college but not their daughter's grad school. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author had a one-night stand and the mother decided to keep the child, so he became a father. Now, the daughter is upset that he's paying for his son's education but not hers, especially since her mom isn't contributing. The author lists several reasons: he's already paying child support which is a court-ordered amount, his son is going to a cheaper school, he already gave the daughter a car, her mother earns a lot more, and the son's major is practical versus her grad school choice which he deems \"useless.\"\n\nThe key points here are fairness and the reasons behind his decisions. The author is a civil engineer with a decent salary, but he's already paying significant child support. The daughter's mother has a high income, which might mean the daughter has more financial support. The author's wife, the son's mother, has a much lower income, so he's helping her out. Also, the son's choice of a practical major versus the daughter's grad school in a field he considers impractical. \n\nBut wait, the daughter is upset because she feels discriminated against. The author is treating the two children differently based on various factors, which might not be fair. Even if he has his reasons, favoring one child over another can be seen as unfair, especially if the reasons are based on the children's choices (like major) or the parents' income. \n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction was emotional, but the author's response might have been dismissive. He says he's not a bank and his money is his, but as a parent, there's an expectation of equal treatment. Even if there are justifiable differences, the perception of favoritism can harm the parent-child relationship. \n\nThe author's argument that the daughter's mother can afford it might not absolve him from contributing if he's financially able. The fact that he gave the daughter a car but not the son could be seen as unequal. Also, referring to her major as \"useless\" is subjective and could be disrespectful, implying her educational goals aren't valid. \n\nIn terms of legal obligations, he's paying child support, which is separate from educational support. The court might not require him to pay for college, but if he's choosing to pay for one child but not the other, that's a personal decision. However, the emotional impact on the daughter is significant\u2014she feels unloved, which is a strong emotional response. \n\nThe author's reasoning might be rational to him, but treating children differently based on their circumstances (like major or the other parent's income) can be seen as unfair. The daughter's anger stems from feeling less valued. The author's response was to shut down the conversation, which could be exacerbating the issue. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he's showing favoritism and not treating both children equitably, even if his reasons seem logical. The emotional harm caused by his decision and response could outweigh the practical reasons he cites.\n"
