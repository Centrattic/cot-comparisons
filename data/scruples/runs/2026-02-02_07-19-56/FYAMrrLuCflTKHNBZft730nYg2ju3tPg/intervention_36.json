I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the father is paying for his son's undergraduate education but not his daughter's graduate school. The daughter is upset about this and called him sexist. The father gives several reasons for not contributing to her grad school, including financial obligations, her mother's higher income, and the daughter's choice of a \"useless\" major. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The father is paying child support for the daughter, which is a legal obligation and a significant amount. He's also given her a car, which is a substantial gift. On the other hand, he's providing for his son's education, but the daughter feels this is unequal. The daughter's mother can afford her education, while the son's mother has a lower income. The father argues that his money is his to manage, and he's not a bank.\n\nThe daughter's major is a point of contention; the father calls it \"useless\" (gender or black studies), which might imply a bias towards more practical fields. This could be a factor in his decision. However, the daughter feels dismissed and that he cares more about his \"real\" family. The father's response was to say he's not a bank and that her reaction is disrespectful, leading to a hurtful exchange.\n\nLegally, the father is already contributing through child support, which is more than what he gives his son. Financially, the daughter's mother can support her, so the father might feel less obligation. However, emotions play a role here. The daughter feels unappreciated and possibly neglected, which is a valid emotional reaction even if the father's reasoning is practical.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, even if the father has legitimate reasons, the daughter's perception of being treated differently based on gender could be problematic. The father's dismissive attitude toward her emotions and the use of derogatory terms like \"useless\" for her major might come across as sexist, regardless of his intentions. The daughter's anger and the father's defensive response indicate a breakdown in communication and empathy.\n\nAlso, the father's argument that he's contributing more to the daughter already (child support, car) compared to the son (game console) might not address the daughter's need for support in graduate school, which is a separate financial commitment. The daughter might feel that the initial contributions aren't sufficient for her higher education needs.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might argue that parents can choose how to allocate funds, treating children differently based on gender or perceived practicality of their majors could be seen as unfair. The father's justification might be based on his own priorities, but the daughter's reaction is a natural response to feeling undervalued.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the father's actions and his reasoning might be seen as contributing to the daughter's feelings of being treated unfairly. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his reasons are valid enough to justify the differential treatment. However, the way he communicated his decision and dismissed her emotions likely exacerbates the situation, making him at least partially responsible for the conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his treatment of the daughter's feelings and his dismissive attitude towards her academic choices could be seen as unjust, even if his financial reasons are understandable.\n"
