I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a father who had a one-night stand leading to his daughter. He's been paying child support and has now been asked to pay for her grad school. He's paying for his son's undergrad but not her grad school. The daughter is upset, calling him sexist. He lists reasons like financial contributions already through child support, the cost difference between schools, gifts he's given her, the mother's income, and the majors.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants others' opinions. Let's break it down.\n\nHe's a civil engineer with a decent salary. He's paying significant child support to the daughter's mother. He's also helping his son, but not the daughter for grad school. The daughter's mom is well-off, but he's still being asked to contribute. His reasons include the costs, the fact that he's already contributing via child support, and the daughter's major being \"useless.\" That last point seems problematic\u2014assuming certain majors are less valuable is a stereotype.\n\nHe also mentions that he gave the daughter a car, but the son got a game console. So there's a discrepancy in gifts. The daughter feels he's not supporting her education as much as his son. He's being accused of caring more for his \"real\" family, which he denies. But the daughter's reaction is emotional, leading to a harsh exchange.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, treating children differently can be seen as unfair, even if there are justifications. The fact that he's paying for the son's undergrad but not the daughter's grad school could create resentment. His reasoning about the majors being \"useless\" might carry gender bias, considering the daughter's choice of field. Also, the way he dismisses her feelings as an overreaction could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, he's made financial commitments through child support, which might cover some educational costs indirectly. The daughter's mother is more financially capable, which he points out. But the daughter might still expect help, especially if she believes her father is willing to help his son. The argument that the son's major is practical versus the daughter's being \"useless\" is a value judgment that could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nThe key issues here are fairness, his statements about the majors, and the emotional impact on the daughter. Even if there are financial reasons, the way he's handling it might make him the asshole. The daughter's frustration is valid if she feels he's favoring his son, especially given the context of being a one-night stand child. His response about not being a bank and that his money is his might come across as dismissive of her needs.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
