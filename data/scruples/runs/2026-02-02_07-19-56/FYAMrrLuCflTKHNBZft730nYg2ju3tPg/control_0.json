I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. \n\nFirst, the context: The author had a one-night stand that resulted in a daughter. He's been paying child support and has spent his own money on a car for her. Now, the daughter is upset that he's helping her half-brother but not her grad school. The author lists several reasons: child support is already covering a lot, the daughter's school is more expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom is wealthy, and the son's major is practical.\n\nHmm. The daughter's mom is high-earning and can afford her education, while the son's mom has a low income. The author is using his own resources to help the son, who is part of his married family. The daughter's mom is supposed to cover her expenses, but she's asking him for help now. \n\nThe author argues that he's not obligated to pay for her grad school when her mother can afford it. Also, he's already contributing through child support. The daughter feels he's being sexist, but the author denies that. \n\nBut wait, are there legal obligations here? Child support usually covers basic needs, but not necessarily higher education. If the daughter's mom is wealthy, maybe she should cover grad school. The author's reasons seem logical: he's helping the son's family (his wife's lower income) and the daughter's mom is responsible. \n\nHowever, the daughter might feel it's unfair she's being treated differently. But the author has valid points about financial distribution. The daughter's anger might be overreacting, but does that make the author right? \n\nAlso, the author's comment about the major being \"useless\" could come off as dismissive. That might hurt the daughter's feelings and contribute to her anger. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if both children are his, even if from different parents, should he treat them equally? But the circumstances are different: different parents' incomes, different schools, different stages (undergrad vs. grad). \n\nThe author isn't necessarily being sexist; he's making financial decisions based on his situation. But maybe he could have explained his reasoning better instead of making a dismissive comment. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but there's room for empathy towards the daughter's feelings. The key points are the different financial responsibilities and the daughter's mom's ability to pay. The author's actions don't seem malicious, just practical.\n"
