I didn\u2019t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who\u2019s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. \n\n\nThis weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn\u2019t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I\u2019m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my \u201creal\u201d family as opposed to her because I haven\u2019t paid anything for her college career. But, there\u2019s so many reason I\u2019m not comfortable paying for her education, including:\n\n1. I pay child support. I\u2019m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. \n2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son\u2019s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.\n3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I\u2019m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.\n4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son\u2019s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It\u2019s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.\n5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). \n\nI told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I\u2019m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don\u2019t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I\u2019m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she\u2019s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to \u201cfuck off you sexist asshole\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion. \n\n\nTl;dr: Paying for son\u2019s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter\u2019s grad degree and I\u2019m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong, right? The situation is about a father paying for his son's college but not his daughter's grad school. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The father had a one-night stand and the woman got pregnant. He didn't want to keep the baby but stepped up as a father. They have a daughter who's about to go to grad school. Now, the daughter feels he should contribute because he's paying for his son's (her half-brother) education. The father lists several reasons for not paying: child support is already a big chunk, the daughter's grad school is expensive, he already gave her a car, her mom is wealthy, and her major is less practical. The daughter got angry, called him sexist, and there was some conflict.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the key points. The father is being accused of sexism for not paying for his daughter's grad school while paying for his son's undergrad. The daughter's mom is in a higher income bracket, so maybe the father feels he's not responsible for her grad school? But wait, the daughter was his responsibility from the start. He stepped up to be a father, so why is he now differentiating?\n\nThe father mentions child support, which he's contributing significantly. But child support is usually for the child's basic needs, not necessarily education. If the daughter is asking for grad school support, maybe that's beyond the typical child support scope. But then again, if he's willing to pay for his son's undergrad, isn't there an inconsistency? Also, the daughter's mom is the one paying for her undergrad, so maybe the father feels he's not obligated. But the daughter is asking for grad school now, which is a different scenario.\n\nHe also points out the daughter's major is \"useless,\" which might be a biased judgment. That could contribute to his decision, but it's not a valid reason from a fairness standpoint. The father's argument about the car versus a game console might be about the value given before, but that's not directly related to education costs. The daughter might feel that if he's able to give her a car, he can afford grad school help. But the father is comparing different types of expenses.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is strong, but does that make the father wrong? The father is a civil engineer with a decent salary. He's paying for his son's school, which is less expensive. The daughter's grad school is more costly. But he's already contributing through child support, which is a legal obligation. Is it fair to expect him to pay for grad school on top of that?\n\nAnother angle: The father is part of the daughter's life from the beginning. If he's a father, he might be expected to support her education as well. However, the daughter is an adult now, and grad school is a personal choice. Maybe the father isn't obligated, especially if he's already paying child support. But if he's willing to pay for his son's undergrad, there's a discrepancy.\n\nThe daughter's accusation of sexism is a serious one. The father needs to consider if his decision is based on gender. If he would have paid for a son's grad school but not a daughter's, that's sexist. But in this case, the son is only in undergrad, and the daughter is in grad school. So maybe the issue is about the type of education rather than gender. However, the father's reasoning might still have underlying biases, like the major being \"useless\" or the daughter's mother's wealth, but that doesn't directly relate to gender.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if both children are his, he should treat them equally unless there are valid, non-discriminatory reasons. The father's reasons might be justifiable, but the way he's handling it could come off as unfair. Also, the daughter's perception is that he cares more for his \"real\" family, implying he's not treating her as his equal because she's from a one-night stand. That's a significant emotional factor.\n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? He's not necessarily doing anything illegal, but the perception is there. If his decisions are based on gender, even unintentionally, that's a problem. The daughter might feel he's not supporting her because she's a girl. The father's argument about cost and practicality might be valid, but the way he's prioritizing could be seen as unfair. Also, giving a car to the daughter but not the son might seem like unequal treatment. But the son's mother isn't contributing, whereas the daughter's mother is. That complicates things.\n\nIn conclusion, the father might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's a case to be made that he's not treating both children equally. The key issue is whether his decisions are based on gender. If he's paying for the son because he's part of his \"real\" family, that's sexist. But if it's about financial practicality and the son's major being more practical, maybe not. However, the daughter's accusation of sexism and the father's own admission that the daughter is from a one-night stand suggest that there's an underlying bias. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not treating his children equally and for possibly sexist reasoning.\n"
