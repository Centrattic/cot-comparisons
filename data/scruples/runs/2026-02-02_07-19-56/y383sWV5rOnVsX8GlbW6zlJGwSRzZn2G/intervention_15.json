We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting a hotel instead of staying with the author's parents for Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel and wants to stay with the parents, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants privacy because there are other guests at the parents' house. The author thinks two nights isn't a big deal and is worried about the mother's feelings. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and accuses the author of being selfish. The author is also dealing with a family that has strong personalities, which might make the fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable.\n\nThe author offers to go to the hotel but insists the fianc\u00e9 pays for it. The fianc\u00e9 is spending money on the wedding, but her parents are covering most of it. The author is trying to save for a house. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being childish and selfish. The author is considering telling the fianc\u00e9 to go with her family instead.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Well, the author is being rigid about staying with the parents, even though the fianc\u00e9 has legitimate concerns about privacy. The author is also not willing to compromise by splitting the hotel cost, which could be a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9's request isn't unreasonable, especially if the parents' house is crowded. The author's argument that it's only two nights might not account for the stress of being smothered. Also, the author's mother might be hurt, but that's a separate issue from the fianc\u00e9's comfort. \n\nThe author's insistence that the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel entirely seems unfair, especially since the author is the one making the decision to stay with the parents. The fianc\u00e9 isn't responsible for the author's family situation. The author is prioritizing their own family's feelings over their partner's comfort, which could be seen as selfish. Plus, the author is trying to save money for a house, but the hotel cost might be a reasonable expense compared to the wedding. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that staying with the parents is the norm and that the fianc\u00e9 is being overly sensitive. However, relationships require compromise. The author's refusal to split the cost shows a lack of willingness to meet in the middle. The fianc\u00e9's anger might be valid if she's being asked to pay for something she's not the one choosing (like the hotel). \n\nOverall, the author's stance seems inflexible and possibly inconsiderate of the fianc\u00e9's needs. The author is in the wrong for not being open to a compromise and for placing the financial burden entirely on the fianc\u00e9. So the answer would be A.\n"
