We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting to stay with the author's parents during Christmas and instead wanting a hotel. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and expects the fianc\u00e9 to cover the cost. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about this and feels the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that staying with the parents is the norm they've done before, and they're trying to save money for a house. The fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with the lack of privacy at the parents' house, especially since there are other guests. The author mentions that the parents might be hurt because they don't see each other often, and the family has strong personalities, which adds to the stress for the fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe author is pushing back against the hotel request because they think it's only two nights and they want to stick with the traditional plan. But the fianc\u00e9 is arguing that the author is being selfish by making her pay for the hotel herself, especially when she's already spending a lot on the wedding. The author clarifies that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, which is a huge expense, but the author is trying to save for a house. \n\nSo, the key points here are about compromise, financial responsibility, and respect for each other's feelings. The author is prioritizing saving money and not wanting to disrupt the usual plans, while the fianc\u00e9 values privacy and is uncomfortable in the parents' home. The author's stance is that if the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to stay with the parents, she should pay for the alternative. The fianc\u00e9 feels this is unfair, especially since the author's family might be upset and the author is not considering her discomfort.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. Compromise is essential in a relationship, especially when planning holidays. The author is not willing to meet halfway by splitting the hotel cost or even covering a portion of it. By making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely, the author is not showing consideration for her feelings about privacy and the potential stress of the situation. Even though the author has valid points about saving money and the short duration, the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable given the circumstances. The author's refusal to share the cost unless the fianc\u00e9 pays entirely could be seen as inconsiderate. Additionally, the author's threat to have the fianc\u00e9 go to her own family is a possible overreaction and might indicate a lack of willingness to find a middle ground.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting by accusing the author of selfishness when the author is trying to manage finances. However, the author's approach of not budging on the hotel payment and not acknowledging the fianc\u00e9's discomfort might be the bigger issue here. Relationships require mutual respect and flexibility. The author's stance could be seen as prioritizing their own preferences without adequately considering their partner's needs, which could indeed be in the wrong.\n"
