We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house during Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel and tells the fianc\u00e9 to pay for it herself. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and accuses the author of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is on a tight budget, wanting to save for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's family is paying for an expensive wedding. The author's parents have a house, but the fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with the lack of privacy. The author is also dealing with potential hurt feelings from the parents. \n\nThe main conflict is about who should pay for the hotel. The author is not willing to spend money on it, which they can't afford, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting the fianc\u00e9 to pay if she insists on the hotel.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the fianc\u00e9 is the one choosing to stay in a hotel instead of the parents' house, it's reasonable for her to cover the cost. The author isn't obligated to pay for her preference. The fianc\u00e9's argument about the wedding payments doesn't seem relevant because her parents are already paying for the wedding. The author is trying to save for a house, which is a valid financial priority.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as dismissive. Telling the fianc\u00e9 to go to her own family could be harsh, but the author's main stance is about financial responsibility. The fianc\u00e9's discomfort with the parents is a real issue, but maybe the author could have found a compromise, like a budget-friendly hotel or discussing the budget more openly. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong for expecting the fianc\u00e9 to pay for her choice. The fianc\u00e9 is the one making a preference that comes with extra cost, and the author is managing their finances responsibly. The author's priorities are valid, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction might be overstepping by conflating the hotel cost with the wedding expenses. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
