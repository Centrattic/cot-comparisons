We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, who is engaged, wants to stay with their parents for Christmas, but their fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, insisting the fianc\u00e9 cover the cost. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels abandoned, and mentions the author's previous refusal to pay for her wedding-related expenses.\n\nFirst, consider privacy. The parents' house is crowded, so the fianc\u00e9's desire for privacy is valid. Two nights might seem short, but if the environment is stressful, it's a reasonable request. The author's stance on not spending money on the hotel could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's comfort and emotional needs. \n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The author is saving for a house, which is a significant life goal. However, the fianc\u00e9's parents are covering most of the wedding costs, which the author brings up as a counter. But the key point here is that the author is asking the fianc\u00e9 to pay for the hotel, not the wedding. The fianc\u00e9 is not the one paying; her parents are. The author's argument about the wedding might be a red herring or a way to justify their stance, but it's not directly relevant. \n\nEmotionally, the author is dismissing the fianc\u00e9's feelings about privacy and the stress of family interactions. The fianc\u00e9 feels that the author is prioritizing their parents' preferences over their own relationship's comfort. The author's threat to cancel the trip might be a result of feeling cornered, but it's a harsh response. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a shared aspect in a relationship. While saving for a house is important, so is respecting each other's needs. The author's refusal to compromise here could be seen as selfish, especially if it causes significant distress. The fianc\u00e9's anger and feeling of abandonment suggest that the author's actions are hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid point about the short duration and the desire to avoid extra costs. However, the way it's handled\u2014demanding the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel\u2014might be the issue. A compromise, like splitting the cost or finding a middle ground, might be more balanced. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. The author's response seems to lack understanding of the fianc\u00e9's perspective, focusing more on their own financial goals and the parents' feelings. The fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about privacy and comfort are not adequately addressed, leading to conflict. \n\nOverall, the author's insistence on the fianc\u00e9 paying for the hotel, despite the fianc\u00e9's valid reasons, and the dismissive attitude towards her feelings might place them in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and flexibility, and the author's approach here lacks that.\n"
