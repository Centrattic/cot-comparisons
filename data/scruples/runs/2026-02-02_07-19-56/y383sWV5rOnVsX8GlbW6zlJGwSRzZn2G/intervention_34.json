We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong for making his fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel. The situation is about Christmas plans where the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy instead of staying with his parents. The author refuses to pay for the hotel and insists the fianc\u00e9 pay for it herself.\n\nFirst, looking at the dynamics: the author is arguing that two nights isn't a big deal and that staying with his parents is more important. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about privacy, which is a valid concern, especially if the parents have other guests. The author also mentions his mother's feelings, which adds emotional pressure. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 accuses the author of being selfish and a child. The author counters by saying the fianc\u00e9 isn't contributing financially, as her parents are paying for the wedding, which is expensive. The author is trying to save for a house. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, compromise is key. The author is refusing to spend money on a hotel, which is his right, but making the fianc\u00e9 pay for it herself could be seen as unfair. If the fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable staying with his parents due to privacy issues, the author's insistence might be dismissive of her feelings. The author's response to the fight is to tell her to go to her family, but he hasn't done that yet. \n\nThe key point is that both sides have valid points. The author is concerned about tradition and finances, while the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about privacy and comfort. However, making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself after she's already expressed discomfort might be seen as shifting the cost and responsibility onto her, which could be unfair. The author's main point is that it's only two nights, but if privacy is a significant issue, that two nights could be stressful. \n\nAlso, the author's mention of financial priorities (saving for a house vs. the wedding) adds context. The fianc\u00e9's family is paying for an elaborate wedding, which the author feels is a burden. But the author's solution is to make the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel, which might not be fair if they are supposed to be a team in finances. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider each other's needs and find a middle ground. The author's stance might be seen as rigid and not accommodating his fianc\u00e9's needs, hence being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to stay with his parents and insists on privacy, the author's refusal to share the cost could be seen as reasonable. However, making her pay entirely might come off as punitive. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's not considering his fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about privacy and is making her handle the costs, which could be seen as selfish. The compromise would be to either split the cost or find a middle solution, but he's not offering that. Instead, he's taking an all-or-nothing approach, which is where he might be in the wrong.\n"
