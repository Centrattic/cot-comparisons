We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of at the author's parents for Christmas, and the author insisting that if she wants the hotel, she should pay for it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and fianc\u00e9 are visiting his parents for Christmas, which they've done before. This time, the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights because she feels there's no privacy, and she's complaining about the author's mom's feelings. The author is reluctant to spend money on a hotel, especially since his in-laws are pushing for an expensive wedding, and he wants to save for a house. He makes the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants to go, leading to a fight where she feels he's being selfish.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In many Western cultures, visiting family during Christmas is common, and staying at the parents' house is expected, especially if it's a tradition. However, the fianc\u00e9's comfort is also a factor. If the parents' home is crowded and the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered, maybe her request is reasonable. The author is in a position where he's trying to save money for a house, which is a big commitment. But making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself might seem unfair, especially if they're a couple. Typically, shared expenses in a relationship, especially for events like Christmas, are split or handled jointly. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's only two nights, and the fianc\u00e9 is getting upset over something minor. But the fianc\u00e9's perspective is about her need for privacy and comfort during a stressful time. The author is also concerned about his mother's feelings, which could add to the tension. However, the way he's handling it by making her pay might come off as dismissive. \n\nThe fact that the author's in-laws are covering most of the wedding costs might be a point. The fianc\u00e9 could feel entitled to some expenses being covered by the author, but in this case, the hotel is a separate matter. The author's stance is about saving money, which is understandable, but the approach of making her pay the entire bill could be seen as selfish, especially if they have a shared financial plan. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author didn't want a hotel due to cost and tradition, but the fianc\u00e9 has a valid reason. Instead of making it a financial ultimatum, maybe discussing compromises would be better. The author's response of saying she should pay the whole bill if she wants to go to the hotel might have been too harsh, leading to the fight. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if they are a couple with shared future plans (like a house), splitting the hotel cost might be more reasonable than making her pay all. But the author is trying to save, so maybe he has a point. However, the way he's enforcing it could be the issue here. \n\nSo, the author's justification for making her pay is about saving money for a house, but the fianc\u00e9's needs are also important. The author is not wrong in wanting to save, but the method of handling the disagreement might be where he's in the wrong. Insisting on her paying all could be seen as prioritizing his own financial goals over her comfort without considering it's a shared experience. \n\nI think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because while saving money is important, expecting the other person to cover the entire cost of their choice for privacy might be selfish. A better approach would be to find a middle ground, like splitting the cost or discussing why he's unwilling to spend money. His response was more about making her pay rather than understanding her perspective, which leads to the conflict.\n"
