We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author and their fianc\u00e9 disagreeing on where to stay for Christmas. The author wants to stay with their parents, while the fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel for privacy. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, so the fianc\u00e9 is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a big life goal. They might feel that staying with parents is cheaper. But the fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with the parents and wants privacy. The author's parents might be having other guests too, which could make the stay more crowded. The author mentions that the parents have strong personalities, which the fianc\u00e9 finds smothering. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's only two nights and they don't want to spend money on a hotel. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset about the lack of privacy and feels the author is being selfish. The author is also concerned about the mother's feelings because they don't see her often. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is not the one paying for the wedding; her parents are. The author is trying to save money, but the fianc\u00e9 feels like the author isn't contributing to her comfort. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Maybe, but they have valid reasons too. They're trying to save money, which is important for their future. However, the fianc\u00e9's feelings about privacy and comfort are also important in a relationship. The author's refusal to compromise by splitting the cost or finding a middle ground might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nThe key points are communication and compromise. Relationships require both parties to consider each other's perspectives. The author's stance is firm, but maybe not considering the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy as much as they should. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting to a short stay. \n\nI think both have some responsibility here. The author could have offered to share the hotel cost if the fianc\u00e9 values it that much, instead of making her pay entirely. The fianc\u00e9 might be expecting the author to prioritize her comfort over saving money, which could be a reasonable request. However, the author's financial goals are also valid. \n\nIn the end, the author's refusal to split the cost and the way they framed it (making her pay entirely) might be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because a relationship requires compromise and supporting each other's comfort, even if it costs a bit. But maybe there's a middle ground they didn't explore.\n"
