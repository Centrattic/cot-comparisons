We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay in a hotel instead of visiting the author's parents for Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and is saying that if the fianc\u00e9 wants to stay there, she should pay for it herself. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and says the author is selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's arguments: they've stayed at their parents' house before, which is fine. They mention that the hotel is expensive and they want to save money for a house. Also, there's the issue of the fianc\u00e9's parents paying for most of the wedding, which they can't afford, while the author is trying to save. The author feels that the hotel is unnecessary since it's only two nights and the parents are expecting them to stay with them.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and feels smothered by the author's family, especially since there are other guests. The author's mother might be hurt because they don't see each other often. The author is being accused of being selfish for not wanting to pay for the hotel and for not compromising.\n\nNow, thinking about fairness. Compromise is usually important in relationships. The author is standing their ground on not paying for the hotel, but the fianc\u00e9 has a valid reason for wanting privacy. The author's argument about saving money for a house is understandable, but marriage often involves shared expenses. If the author is willing to let the fianc\u00e9 stay with her parents, maybe that's a better solution. However, the author is suggesting that the fianc\u00e9 should pay for the hotel herself, which could be seen as a compromise, but maybe not a fair one if they are supposed to share expenses after marriage.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding. The author is trying to save for a house, which is a major life expense. The fianc\u00e9 is not paying for anything herself, which might create some resentment. The author's stance on the hotel could be seen as trying to be fair by not spending unnecessary money, especially when the fianc\u00e9's family is already spending on the wedding.\n\nHowever, the author's response to the situation\u2014refusing to budge and making the fianc\u00e9 pay herself\u2014might come off as selfish because they are not considering the fianc\u00e9's comfort and feelings. The two nights might be short, but privacy issues can be significant. The author is also making their mother feel hurt, which is another factor. The author is caught between their family expectations and their fianc\u00e9's needs.\n\nIs the author wrong for not compromising? Maybe. Relationships require give and take. If the author is unwilling to pay for the hotel but also doesn't want the fianc\u00e9 to stay with her parents, perhaps they should find a middle ground, like splitting the cost or looking for a cheaper option. By making the fianc\u00e9 pay in full, the author is not showing flexibility, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the author is threatening to split the holiday, which is a big deal. While the fianc\u00e9 might overreact, the author's ultimatum could be seen as harsh. The author's reasoning about saving money is valid, but the way they handled the situation might be the issue. They didn't offer alternatives or try to find a solution that works for both parties.\n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe the author is not entirely wrong because they have valid financial concerns. However, the approach taken could be the problem. Not being open to compromise and not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings might make the author at fault. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and flexibility.\n"
