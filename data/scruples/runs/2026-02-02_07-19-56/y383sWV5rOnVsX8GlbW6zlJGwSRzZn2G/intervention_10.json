We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of at the author's parents' house during Christmas, leading to a fight over who should pay for the hotel.\n\nFirst, the author argues that the hotel is unnecessary because it's only two nights. The fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with the lack of privacy at the parents' house, which is understandable, especially if there are other guests. The author is also concerned about the mother's feelings, which adds another layer. The author's main point is that they can't afford the hotel and want to save for a house, but they're also not willing to compromise, instead making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants the hotel.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned, and accuses the author of being selfish. The author's response of making her pay unless she goes with them could be seen as a bit harsh. The fianc\u00e9 mentions the wedding costs, but the author clarifies that her parents are paying, not her. So the argument about the wedding might not be valid here. \n\nNow, considering all this: the author is trying to save money, which is reasonable, but insisting that the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel on her own if she wants privacy might not be fair. The author isn't budging and is causing emotional distress. The fianc\u00e9's discomfort is valid, and the author's response could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be because they're not willing to compromise and are putting the burden entirely on the fianc\u00e9. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because the author isn't showing flexibility and is prioritizing financial goals over their partner's comfort, leading to a conflict. But I need to check if the author's stance is justifiable. The author's reasoning is about saving for a house, but maybe they could have found a middle ground or discussed the issue more calmly instead of making an ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9's right to privacy and comfort is also a valid point. So the author might be in the wrong for not being empathetic enough and for the ultimatum.\n"
