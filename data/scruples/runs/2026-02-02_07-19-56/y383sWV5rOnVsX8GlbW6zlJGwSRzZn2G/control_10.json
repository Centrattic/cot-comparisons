We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about their fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of with his parents for Christmas. The author said she has to pay for the hotel herself because he's not willing to spend the money. She got mad and thinks he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is trying to save money for a house, and maybe staying with his parents is cheaper. His fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is uncomfortable with his family, which is valid. The author's parents are getting hurt feelings, but the fianc\u00e9's discomfort is also real. \n\nHe argues it's only two nights and that they've stayed with his parents before. She wants privacy, which is a reasonable request. But he's not budging and is making her pay, which might seem unfair. The fianc\u00e9 mentions her parents are paying for the wedding, but she's not actually paying, so maybe she's using that as a point in the argument. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Well, he's standing by his decision to save money, but maybe not considering her feelings enough. However, he's trying to be responsible with their finances. The fianc\u00e9 is asking for a reasonable accommodation (privacy) which isn't unreasonable. Making her pay for the hotel might not be fair, especially if they're a couple and should share expenses. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to set a boundary. Maybe they should have discussed this earlier. The fact that there's a fight suggests that communication is an issue. Maybe the author could have offered a compromise, like splitting the cost or finding a middle ground. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable, and he's making her pay without considering shared responsibility, then maybe he's being selfish. But if saving for a house is a shared goal, maybe he's just prioritizing that. The answer isn't clear. \n\nBut in these AITA scenarios, people often look at fairness. Making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel when it's a shared trip might be seen as unfair. So the author could be in the wrong for not being flexible and making her bear the cost. Also, the parents' hurt feelings are on his side, but the fianc\u00e9's comfort matters too. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her needs and is using the financial savings as a reason to make her uncomfortable. Couples usually share expenses, and forcing her to pay might be unfair.\n"
