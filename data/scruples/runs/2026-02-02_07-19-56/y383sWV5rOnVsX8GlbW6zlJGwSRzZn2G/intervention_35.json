We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 couple planning to visit the author's parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel instead of with the parents, and the author is refusing to pay for it, making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author thinks staying with the parents is fine, even though there are other guests and it's only two nights. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she wants privacy and feels smothered. The author is already worried about their mother's feelings. The author mentions not wanting to spend money on a hotel and is willing to split the cost if needed, but when the fianc\u00e9 insists, he makes her pay the entire bill. The fianc\u00e9 then accuses him of being selfish and acting like a child. The author is considering cutting things off but hasn't.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's only two nights and they've stayed with the parents before. The fianc\u00e9's issue is about privacy and the family's strong personalities. The author is also saving money for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding. The author is trying to be frugal here.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require compromise. Insisting on staying with the parents despite the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about privacy might not be considerate. The author is making a financial argument, but the fianc\u00e9's emotional needs (feeling smothered) are important too. Making her pay the entire hotel cost if she wants privacy might be seen as punishing her for her preference. The author could have suggested a middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a cheaper hotel. By refusing to budge and forcing her to pay, he's not showing flexibility. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be strong, but the author's response is also rigid. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more understanding and for making the financial ultimatum. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
