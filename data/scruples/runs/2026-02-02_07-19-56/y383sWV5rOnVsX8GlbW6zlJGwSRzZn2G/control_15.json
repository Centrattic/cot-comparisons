We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the fianc\u00e9 should pay for the hotel. The user says they want to visit their parents for Christmas, which they've done before by staying there. This time, the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel because of privacy issues, but the author refuses to pay for it, making the fianc\u00e9 pay herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that staying with parents is the norm they've used before, and they don't want to spend extra money on a hotel. They mention that their fianc\u00e9 is complaining about privacy, but it's only two nights and there are other guests. The author is also concerned about their mother's feelings because they don't see their parents often. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is upset about the author not being willing to spend on a hotel. She accuses the author of being selfish and acting like a child. The author pushes back by making her pay if she wants the hotel. Also, there's a mention that her parents want a big wedding that's not affordable, and the author is saving for a house. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that since her parents are paying for the wedding, the author should contribute to the hotel. \n\nI need to assess if the author is being unreasonable. The key points are financial responsibility, compromise in a relationship, and respecting each other's needs. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a significant life goal. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid, but maybe she's expecting the author to cover the cost without considering his financial priorities. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting her to pay if she wants the hotel? They did agree to visit the parents, so maybe splitting the cost or finding another solution would be better. However, the author is making a stand on their financial priorities. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be over the top if she's not actually paying for anything herself and is expecting the author to foot the bill despite their financial plans. \n\nAlso, the author's concern about their mother's feelings adds another layer. Prioritizing family traditions versus personal comfort is a common issue. But forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with the parents against her wishes might not be fair either. The author's ultimatum to let her go with her family if she doesn't want to compromise could be a harsh solution but might be necessary if the arguments aren't resolved. \n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships require negotiation. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially regarding finances. However, maybe they could have found a middle ground, like splitting the hotel cost or choosing a different time for the visit. The fianc\u00e9's expectations might not align with the author's financial situation, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're standing up for their financial goals and making a request for the fianc\u00e9 to take responsibility if she wants the hotel. However, the situation could have been handled better with more communication and compromise. But based on the information given, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
