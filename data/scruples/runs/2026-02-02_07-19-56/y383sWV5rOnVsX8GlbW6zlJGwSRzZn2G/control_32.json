We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 and their partner planning to visit his parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel instead because of privacy issues, but the author (the fianc\u00e9) is making her pay for the hotel herself, and she's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is not willing to pay for the hotel, so if the fianc\u00e9 wants to stay there, she has to cover the cost. The main arguments are about privacy versus family time and financial responsibility. The author mentions that they've stayed at his parents before, but this time the fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable. The author is also concerned about his mother's feelings and the family dynamics, which are complicated with strong personalities. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she's spending a lot on the wedding through her parents, so the author feels he's being asked to contribute to something he's not paying for anyway. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author is setting a boundary by saying he's not paying for the hotel, which is his right. However, he's choosing to leave his fianc\u00e9 to handle the expenses alone, which might not be considerate. The fianc\u00e9's reasons for wanting privacy are valid, especially with multiple family members present. The author's response could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, even if he's trying to save money for a house. \n\nBut then, the author's mother's feelings and the fact that they've done this before might make the situation more complex. The author is trying to balance family expectations and financial planning. However, by making his fianc\u00e9 pay, he's not compromising. Maybe the right approach would be to find a middle ground, like splitting the cost or discussing why privacy is such an issue. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 accuses the author of being selfish, which might be an overreaction, but the author's stance could also be rigid. The question is whether the author is wrong for not budging. Since the author is not forcing his fianc\u00e9 to stay with his parents, just not covering the hotel cost, it's more about financial responsibility and mutual respect. If the author is okay with staying at his parents and the hotel is her preference, then he's not necessarily in the wrong for not paying. However, by creating a divide where she's forced to choose, there might be a lack of compromise. \n\nIn the AITA context, it's often about empathy and shared responsibility. The author's reasoning is about saving money and respecting family traditions, but the fianc\u00e9's comfort is also important. The author's solution (she pays) is a non-negotiable stance, which might be seen as the problem. So, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but there's room for better communication. Alternatively, if the author is being inflexible without considering the situation, maybe A. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is whether the author is wrong for not compromising. Since he's allowing his fianc\u00e9 to choose the hotel but not paying for it, it's a matter of financial responsibility. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the author isn't supporting her choice financially, but the author is prioritizing his financial goals. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not forcing her to stay, just not covering the cost. However, the way he handled the argument might be part of the issue. But since the question is strictly about being in the wrong, not about the argument's tone, the answer is likely B.\n"
