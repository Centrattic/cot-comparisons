We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting to stay at the author's parents' house for Christmas, preferring a hotel instead. The author is saying they can't afford the hotel and made their fianc\u00e9 pay for it herself. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's parents have a house, and they've stayed there before. The fianc\u00e9 feels smothered due to the strong personalities and lack of privacy. The author is already worried about their mother's feelings because they don't see her often. The hotel is for two nights, which the author thinks is short. However, the author is also concerned about money because they want to save for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding. \n\nThe author's stance is that they can't afford the hotel, so if the fianc\u00e9 wants to stay there, she should pay. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels abandoned and that the author isn't contributing. The author is defensive about the money, pointing out that the fianc\u00e9's family is covering the wedding costs.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are about financial responsibility, respect for each other's feelings, and compromising. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a big investment. The fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy, which is a valid concern. By making her pay for the hotel, the author is trying to avoid financial strain. But maybe the author could have approached this differently, like discussing the budget and finding a middle ground, such as splitting the cost or finding a more affordable hotel. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author isn't considering her comfort and that the financial argument is not entirely fair since her parents are contributing to the wedding. The author's response of not splitting the cost and making the fianc\u00e9 pay in full might come across as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not being willing to compromise or find a solution that addresses both their concerns. The author is prioritizing their financial goals over the fianc\u00e9's comfort, which could be seen as selfish. However, the author is also trying to save for a house, which is a significant life decision. The fianc\u00e9's request is for two nights, which might not be too costly if they found a budget hotel. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate their financial constraints earlier or consider alternative solutions. \n\nAlternatively, if the author truly can't afford it and the fianc\u00e9's request is a luxury, then the author isn't wrong. But the way the situation was handled\u2014refusing to budge and making the fianc\u00e9 pay in full\u2014could be seen as cold. There's a lack of empathy or willingness to meet halfway. \n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about compromise and understanding. The author's position is firm, but maybe they could have been more flexible. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's feelings and didn't find a middle ground, instead making an ultimatum that caused tension. They should have discussed the financial part more and perhaps found a way to accommodate both their needs.\n"
