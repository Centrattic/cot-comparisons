We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself because she doesn't want to stay with his parents on Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy because the parents' house is crowded. The author is unwilling to pay for it, thinking it's just two nights and that they've stayed at the parents' before. The author mentions that staying with the parents might upset the mother, and there's tension about the wedding costs and financial priorities.\n\nSo, the main point of conflict is financial responsibility and differing priorities. The author is trying to save money for a house, while the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author isn't being considerate. The author expects the fianc\u00e9 to pay if she wants the hotel, which could be seen as holding her accountable. However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that splitting costs is fair, especially since they're a couple. The author's stance could be seen as inflexible if the hotel is a reasonable request for comfort. On the other hand, the author has valid reasons about budgeting and previous arrangements. \n\nThe key factors here are communication, mutual respect, and understanding. The author might not be in the wrong if they're standing by their financial decisions, but could be wrong if they're not compromising. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is understandable, so the author's refusal without negotiation might be the issue. Since the author is willing to go to the hotel only if she pays, but not compromising on splitting costs, that could be where they're wrong. Alternatively, if the fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable, the author is justified. The answer likely depends on whether the hotel is a fair expense for privacy versus the parents' house being a traditional, cheaper option. Given the situation, the author's rigidity might be the problem, so the answer is A.\n"
