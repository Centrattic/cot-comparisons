We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if they are in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because she doesn't want to stay with his parents over Christmas. The main points here are about the conflict between staying with family, privacy concerns, financial responsibilities, and how both parties are handling the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel to avoid staying with the parents. The author's parents have a strong personality, and the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered. The author is resistant because it's only two nights and they've done it before. But now, the author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself. The key here is that the author is not spending money on it, so the fianc\u00e9 is left to handle the cost. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 accuses the author of abandoning her and acting like a child. The author mentions that his in-laws want an expensive wedding, but they are actually the ones paying for most of it, not the fianc\u00e9. The author is trying to save for a house. So, the financial aspect is part of the argument. The author is not willing to share the cost of the hotel, even though the fianc\u00e9 is contributing to the wedding expenses, which are being covered by her parents. \n\nI need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. On one hand, visiting family is a common tradition, and the author is trying to save money. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's comfort and privacy are valid concerns, especially if the parents' home isn't ideal for their stay. Making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel might be seen as unfair if the author is not contributing at all. However, the author is not in a position to pay for the hotel if they're trying to save for a house. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The author is not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with his parents; he's saying that if she wants the hotel, she should pay. But it could come off as dismissive of her feelings. The author's reasoning is that it's only two nights, but the fianc\u00e9's discomfort is real. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a factor here. If the author can't afford to contribute to the hotel, maybe they should have discussed that earlier. However, the author is saving for a house, which is a significant financial goal. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, which is a separate issue. \n\nIt seems like the author is not wrong in wanting to save money for a house, but perhaps the way he's handling the situation is causing unnecessary conflict. He's not making her stay with his parents, but he's not willing to share the hotel cost. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that since they're a couple, they should share expenses and that the author is being selfish by not contributing. \n\nSo, there's a balance between respecting the fianc\u00e9's wishes and managing finances. The author's stance is firm, but maybe he should have tried to find a middle ground. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her to stay with his parents and is offering an alternative where she pays for the hotel, maybe he's not wrong. But the way he's making her pay without compromise could be an issue. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for expecting his fianc\u00e9 to cover the hotel cost if that's her preference. However, their communication might be lacking, and the author could be more considerate in his approach. But in terms of right or wrong, it's about shared responsibility. If the author can't afford to contribute, it's not necessarily wrong for him to say so. The main issue is the fight and the accusation of selfishness, but the author's intention is to save for a house. So, AITA-wise, the author isn't the one in the wrong.\n"
