We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants to stay there. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side is that staying with the parents is a tradition they've done before, and they're trying to save money for a house. They mention that the fianc\u00e9 is getting a huge wedding paid for by her parents, which they haven't complained about. The author feels that two nights isn't a big deal for privacy issues and is concerned about their mother's hurt feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is uncomfortable with the family dynamics. She's upset because she feels the author is being selfish and not considering her needs. She's also bringing up the wedding expenses as a point, even though she's not the one paying for it. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for making her pay for the hotel if she wants that option.\n\nSo, are there any cultural or social norms here? Staying with in-laws can be a touchy subject. Privacy is a valid concern, especially with other guests. The author is trying to balance family traditions and their own financial goals. But at the same time, respecting the fianc\u00e9's comfort is important in a relationship. Maybe the author could have offered a compromise, like splitting the cost or finding a middle ground. \n\nThe key point is that the author is not willing to pay for the hotel unless the fianc\u00e9 does. Is it reasonable to expect one person to cover the cost of a choice that the other is making? The author is standing by their decision to save money, but maybe they should have discussed this more before getting angry. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's reaction might be over the top, but her feelings of being smothered are valid. The author might be prioritizing their parents' feelings over the fianc\u00e9's comfort. Financial responsibility is important, but so is emotional support in a relationship. Maybe the author is being a bit rigid here. \n\nIn terms of fairness, is it wrong to ask your partner to cover the cost of a choice they're making? If the author is okay with staying with their parents, then making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants a hotel isn't inherently wrong. But the way the argument escalated might be where the issue is. Communication and understanding both perspectives are key. The author might be in the right in terms of financial responsibility but possibly missing the emotional side. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because they're standing by their decision to save money and not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay. But maybe A because they're not considering the fianc\u00e9's needs enough. Hmm. This is tricky.\n"
