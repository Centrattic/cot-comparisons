We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants to go that route.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they've stayed with their parents before, and this is a short two-night visit. They don't want to spend money on a hotel and are concerned about their mother's feelings. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, wants privacy and is upset about the lack of it at the parents' house. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 is part of a family with strong personalities, so maybe the parents are a bit overwhelming. \n\nThe author is also under financial strain because the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for an expensive wedding, which the author can't afford. The author is trying to save for a house. They're asking the fianc\u00e9 to pay for the hotel if she insists, which seems like a reasonable compromise. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and accuses the author of being selfish. \n\nNow, considering the key points. The author is not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with the parents; they're just saying they won't pay for the hotel. The fianc\u00e9 has a valid point about privacy, but the author is setting a boundary about their own financial responsibility. The author's parents might be hurt, but the author's right to set limits is important in a relationship. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument about the wedding costs doesn't seem fair because the author isn't asking for financial help with the wedding. The author is just being asked to cover the hotel, which they can't afford. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key, but so is respecting each other's boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the hotel, especially when they're saving for a house. The fianc\u00e9 needs to accept that if she wants the hotel, she has to cover the cost. The author isn't being selfish by refusing to spend their money on something the fianc\u00e9 wants but the author doesn't. \n\nSo, the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
