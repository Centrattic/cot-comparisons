We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel during a Christmas visit to the author's parents instead of staying there, and the author is refusing to pay for the hotel, making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants to go.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's argument is that staying with the parents is normal (they've done it before), and it's only two nights. They mention that the fianc\u00e9 is upset about lack of privacy because there are other guests, but the author finds that a small issue. Also, the author is concerned about the fianc\u00e9's parents wanting an expensive wedding, and the author is trying to save money for a house. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels that the author is being selfish by not accommodating her preference for privacy and is making her pay for the hotel, even though her parents are paying for the wedding. The author is considering cutting off contact but hasn't done so yet.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about compromise in a relationship, financial considerations, and mutual respect. Staying with family can be stressful for some people, and privacy is a valid concern. The author is expecting the fianc\u00e9 to stay with their parents, which is a common practice in some families, but the fianc\u00e9's discomfort is real. The author is not wrong for wanting to save money for a house, but is it fair to make the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she prefers it? The author is saying if she wants the hotel, she pays for it. That seems like a compromise, but maybe not a fair one if the relationship is supposed to be shared expenses, especially for a short stay. \n\nHowever, the author is also navigating family expectations. The mother's feelings might be hurt, but the fianc\u00e9's comfort is also important. The author's reasoning that two nights is short might be valid, but if the fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable, the author should consider their feelings. Also, the fianc\u00e9 is upset about the author not contributing to the hotel cost, even though the author is saving for a house. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, which is a different expense. The author's stance might be seen as pragmatic but could be perceived as not valuing the fianc\u00e9's needs enough.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships require negotiation. The author could have offered to split the hotel cost as a middle ground, but instead, they're making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely. That might be the point where the author is being inflexible. The author's argument is about saving money, but the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy could be a valid reason for the hotel. The author's response to the fianc\u00e9's concerns by making her pay in full could be seen as dismissive of her needs. The author's mention of the mother's feelings is also a factor, but that's on the author's side of the family, while the fianc\u00e9's comfort is about their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not finding a middle ground and for not being considerate enough of the fianc\u00e9's needs, despite the author's own financial goals. Relationships often require compromises, and the author's refusal to contribute to the hotel without a clear reason (other than saving for a house) might not be fair. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is reasonable, and the author's response could be seen as selfish, even if they have their own priorities. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. For example, if the author's financial situation is dire and they can't afford the hotel, but the post doesn't indicate that. It just says they want to save for a house, which is a future goal. So, maybe the author is being too rigid. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
