We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should pay for a hotel room so their fianc\u00e9 can avoid staying with the author's parents during Christmas.\n\nFirst, the author is saying that the fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel because she feels there's no privacy with the author's parents. The author thinks it's just two nights and doesn't want to spend the money. They offered to stay with the parents and made the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself if she wants to go that route. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and thinks the author is being selfish, especially since her parents are paying for the wedding. The author is considering telling her to stay with her family instead.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The author's main argument is that they don't want to spend the money and that staying with the parents is more cost-effective. The fianc\u00e9's main issue is about privacy and comfort. The author mentions that the parents have strong personalities and that the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered. So, the fianc\u00e9's request is for her own comfort. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a future goal. But the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author isn't considering her feelings or the stress of being with his family.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to pay for the hotel? Maybe. The author is being practical about money but might not be considering the emotional aspect. The fianc\u00e9 could feel that her needs are being dismissed. Also, the author's parents might be hurt if the couple chooses a hotel, which adds another layer of stress. The author is trying to avoid that by saying \"two nights,\" but the fianc\u00e9's discomfort might still be valid.\n\nOn the flip side, the author is trying to be responsible with finances, especially since the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for an expensive wedding. The author might feel it's unfair to spend more when they're saving for a house. However, the author's solution was to make the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself, which could come off as stingy or not supportive of her needs. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is not standing by her, making her choose between her comfort and the author's financial plans.\n\nIs the author being selfish? It depends on perspective. If the author is prioritizing their financial goals over the fianc\u00e9's emotional well-being, that could be seen as selfish. However, if the author is being realistic about their budget and trying to avoid unnecessary expenses, that's different. But the way the author handled the situation\u2014refusing to compromise and making the fianc\u00e9 foot the bill\u2014might have been hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about the fianc\u00e9's parents paying for the wedding could be a point. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that since her parents are spending money on the wedding, the author should cut her some slack with the hotel. The author's response about saving for a house might be valid, but the way it's framed could make the fianc\u00e9 feel like her needs aren't a priority.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not being more flexible and empathetic. The situation requires balancing financial responsibility with emotional support. Making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself might not be fair if the issue is about her comfort in the relationship. The author should consider that shared experiences and emotional well-being are important in a relationship, even if it costs a bit more. The fianc\u00e9's feelings about privacy and stress from the family might outweigh the cost of a hotel for two nights.\n\nBut then again, the author is also trying to manage their finances responsibly. If the hotel is a significant expense, they might have a point. However, the key is communication and compromise. The author could have suggested a middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a cheaper hotel option. Instead, the author took a hardline stance, leading to conflict. That approach seems less than ideal.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A\u2014author is in the wrong. They could have been more understanding and found a solution that respects both their financial goals and their fianc\u00e9's feelings.\n"
