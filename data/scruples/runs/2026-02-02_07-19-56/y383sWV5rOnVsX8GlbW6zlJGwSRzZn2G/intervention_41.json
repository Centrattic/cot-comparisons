We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of at the author's parents' house for Christmas, and the author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for it herself.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wants to stay with his parents, which he's done before, and the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to stay there because there's no privacy and the family is loud. The author is saying it's only two nights and he's not willing to pay for a hotel. He's asking the fianc\u00e9 to cover the cost if she wants to stay elsewhere. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and that he's being selfish. She also brings up the wedding costs, but it's clarified that she's not actually paying for the wedding; her parents are. The author is saving money for a house.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is not in the wrong if he's standing by his decision to stay with his parents and not pay for a hotel. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is willing to pay, but he's making her pay. The author is firm about his stance, but is that fair?\n\nBut wait, maybe the author is being too inflexible. The fianc\u00e9's request is for privacy, which is a valid concern. The author is prioritizing family time over her comfort, but maybe that's his choice. However, by making her pay for the hotel, he's enforcing his choice without considering her feelings. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author isn't supporting her needs, leading to the conflict. \n\nThe author mentions that the hotel is just two nights, but the fianc\u00e9's discomfort is significant. The author's response to make her pay the entire bill might be seen as dismissive of her valid concerns. Even though the author is saving money for a house, the fianc\u00e9's issue is about privacy and emotional comfort. \n\nAdditionally, the fianc\u00e9's anger might stem from feeling that her preferences aren't respected. The author's refusal to compromise could be seen as selfish, especially if the fianc\u00e9 has a legitimate reason. However, the author is also within his rights to choose where he wants to spend Christmas. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being reasonable in his stance. If the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable and the author is forcing her to pay, maybe he's not wrong in terms of cost but is wrong in not finding a middle ground. However, if the author is firm on staying with his parents, he's not wrong in not wanting to pay for a hotel. But by making her pay, he's not showing support, which could be the problem. \n\nIn terms of the AITA context, the community often looks at fairness and mutual respect. If the author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for her own choice of accommodation, maybe he's not wrong about the cost, but he's wrong in not being flexible. However, if the author is not budging on staying with his parents, he's not necessarily wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the author is choosing his parents' house and making the fianc\u00e9 cover the hotel cost, which she's willing to pay, maybe he's not wrong. But the way he's handling it might show a lack of consideration. However, the core issue is that the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his preference and the fianc\u00e9 is choosing her own arrangement. The cost is on her, so he's not wrong in that sense. But maybe the community would see it as him being inconsiderate, thus in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the author is not wrong if he's standing by his choice. The question is whether he's in the wrong for making her pay. If she wants a hotel, and he's not willing to pay, then she can pay for herself. That's a valid approach. So maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). However, if the community thinks that he should compromise and pay for the hotel for her comfort, then he's in the wrong. But given that he's not budging and she's choosing the hotel herself, he's not wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
