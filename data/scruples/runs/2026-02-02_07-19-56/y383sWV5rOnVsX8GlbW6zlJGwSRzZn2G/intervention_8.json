We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of visiting the author's parents for Christmas, and the author insisting that the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their fianc\u00e9 usually stay at the author's parents' house, but this year the fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel. The main reasons given are lack of privacy because there will be other guests, and the author's mother is hurt because they don't see her often. The author is resistant to the hotel idea, thinking it's only two nights. The fianc\u00e9 got angry, accused the author of being selfish and childish, and mentioned the wedding costs, though the author clarifies that the fianc\u00e9's parents are covering most of the wedding expenses. The author is considering telling the fianc\u00e9 to go to her family instead but hasn't because of the fear of conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me think. The author's stance is about not wanting to spend money on a hotel, which they see as unnecessary for two nights. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy, which is a valid concern, especially if the family is large or has strong personalities. The author is also considering the mother's feelings, which is a family obligation or responsibility. But the author is refusing to compromise and is making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely if she wants the hotel. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy isn't trivial. Even if it's only two nights, family gatherings can be stressful, and a hotel might be a way to recharge. The author is imposing their preference on the fianc\u00e9, which could be seen as selfish. However, the author is also trying to save money for a house, which is a future goal. But refusing to budge entirely and making the fianc\u00e9 pay might be the issue here. Compromise could be possible, like splitting the cost or choosing one night in the hotel. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's anger might stem from feeling her needs are being dismissed. The author's argument that it's only two nights could be valid, but maybe not considering the emotional weight the fianc\u00e9 places on privacy. The author is also worried about the mother's feelings, but that's their family dynamic, not necessarily the fianc\u00e9's responsibility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether they are being overly rigid and not respecting their fianc\u00e9's valid request. By making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel entirely, the author is not compromising. The user's initial thought is yes, and I can see that reasoning. The author is prioritizing their own financial goals and family expectations over the fianc\u00e9's comfort, which might not be fair. The right answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are not being flexible and are making the fianc\u00e9 cover the cost when they could split it or find a middle ground. The argument about the wedding isn't relevant here since the parents are covering the wedding, and the author's financial planning for a house is important, but shouldn't come at the expense of the fianc\u00e9's well-being. The key is compromise in a relationship. The author's response was too adamant without considering shared responsibility.\n"
