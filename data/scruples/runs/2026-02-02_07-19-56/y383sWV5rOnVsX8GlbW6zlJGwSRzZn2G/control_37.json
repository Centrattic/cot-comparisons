We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay in a hotel instead of visiting the author's parents for Christmas. The author says they've done this before, staying at the parents' house, but this time the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about the lack of privacy and the author's mother's feelings. The author is frustrated because it's only two nights and they don't want to pay for the hotel. The fianc\u00e9 then gets angry and accuses the author of being selfish, and there's some mention of the wedding costs and financial stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is that staying with parents is the norm and they don't want to spend money unnecessarily. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is uncomfortable with the parents' strong personalities. The author is also dealing with their mother's feelings and family dynamics. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a reasonable request, which is a hotel stay for two nights, and the author is making her pay for it. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a big part here. The author mentions saving for a house, which is a long-term goal, but the fianc\u00e9 is spending money on the wedding. The author's stance is that they should stay with the parents to save money, but the fianc\u00e9 feels that the author isn't considering her comfort and feelings. \n\nI think the key points are about mutual respect and compromise. The author might be seen as not accommodating the fianc\u00e9's needs, especially since the hotel is a reasonable request. However, the author is also trying to manage finances. But the fact that the author made the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself might be the issue here. It's one thing to not want to spend money, but making the other person pay could come off as selfish. \n\nAlso, considering that the author's mother will be hurt and the family has strong personalities, the author might be under pressure to stay. However, the fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid too. The author's response to the situation by making the fianc\u00e9 handle the hotel cost might have been too harsh, especially given the emotional context. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author could have tried to find a middle ground, maybe suggesting a different arrangement or discussing the finances together. By making the fianc\u00e9 pay alone, it could seem like the author is not willing to share responsibilities, hence being in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their fianc\u00e9's needs and instead made her pay, which could be seen as selfish despite their own financial goals.\n"
