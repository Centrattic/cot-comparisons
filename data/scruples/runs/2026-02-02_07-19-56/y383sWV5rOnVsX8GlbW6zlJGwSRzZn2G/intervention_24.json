We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is the fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay with their parents during Christmas, but their fianc\u00e9e refuses and wants a hotel instead. The author is offering to pay for the hotel if she insists, but she's mad and thinks he's being selfish. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side: they're used to staying with parents, it's only two nights, and they don't want to spend extra money. They're also planning to buy a house, so saving is important. Their parents might feel hurt if they don't visit, and the author is trying to stick to their budget.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's side: she's asking for privacy, which is a valid request. The author's parents have other guests, making the stay potentially uncomfortable. Also, there's a mention of her parents paying for the wedding, which might be a point of tension. She might feel that the author isn't considering her needs for a more comfortable holiday.\n\nThe author's decision to make her pay for the hotel herself seems harsh. While they have a right to set boundaries, making her pay when she's the one requesting the change could be seen as unfair. The author's fianc\u00e9e might feel that the cost should be shared, especially if she's choosing this option for a good reason (privacy and comfort). \n\nThe author is prioritizing their own financial goals and family traditions over their partner's comfort. While it's okay to have differing priorities, the way the author is handling it by not compromising and making her pay the full cost could be seen as inconsiderate. Relationships often require mutual compromise, and this situation seems like it's testing that. \n\nAdditionally, the author's fianc\u00e9e feels smothered, which is a valid emotional concern. The author might not be acknowledging her emotional needs, focusing instead on the short duration and cost. The fact that the author is even considering sending her to her own family is a red flag in terms of communication and empathy.\n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to save money and stay with parents, the way they're handling the situation\u2014refusing to share costs and not considering the emotional impact\u2014could make them at fault here. The key issue is the lack of compromise and the ultimatum given to her. The answer seems like it's leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they're not meeting her needs in a fair way.\n"
