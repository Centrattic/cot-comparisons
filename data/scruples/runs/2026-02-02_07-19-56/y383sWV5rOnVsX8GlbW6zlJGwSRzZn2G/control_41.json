We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of with his parents for Christmas. The author says he's not willing to pay for the hotel and insists they stay with his parents. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about it, saying he's abandoning her and acting like a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main points are that it's only two nights, and they've stayed with the parents before. He's also concerned about his mother's feelings and the cost, especially since he's trying to save for a house. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, wants privacy and feels the parents' house is smothering. She's also bringing up the wedding costs, where the author's side isn't contributing much, even though it's mentioned that her parents are paying for the wedding, not her. \n\nSo, the author is standing his ground on the hotel cost, saying she should pay for it if she wants that. The question is whether he's being selfish or if she's overreacting. From his side, he's trying to be practical, saving money, and honoring his family's tradition. From her side, she's seeking comfort and privacy, which is understandable. But is he wrong to expect her to pay for her preference?\n\nI think the key points are about compromise and communication. The author could have tried to find a middle ground, maybe like splitting the cost or discussing why she needs the hotel. But he's taking a hard line, refusing to spend any money, which might come off as inflexible. However, given that he's saving for a house and the parents are paying for the wedding, maybe his stance isn't unreasonable. It's a cultural thing too\u2014some people prefer family holidays together, others want privacy. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's being rigid without considering her feelings, maybe. But if he's standing up for his financial priorities and family traditions, maybe not. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling him selfish might be an overreaction, but so might his refusal to budge. The answer likely depends on whether mutual compromise is happening. Since the author isn't budging and is making her pay for her choice, maybe he's not entirely wrong. So, perhaps answer B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. Need to check if there's a clear right or wrong here.\n"
