We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their fianc\u00e9 disagreeing about where to stay during Christmas visits. The author wants to stay with their parents, which they've done before, but the fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel for privacy. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, making the fianc\u00e9 cover the cost if she wants to stay there. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and accusing the author of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main points are that staying with parents is the previous norm, the visit is only two nights, and they're trying to save money for a house. The fianc\u00e9's side is about wanting privacy, especially with others present, and possibly feeling smothered by the author's family. The author also mentions the fianc\u00e9's family planning an expensive wedding that they can't afford, which might be a point of contention.\n\nThe author is firm about not spending money on a hotel, which is their prerogative, but making the fianc\u00e9 pay the entire cost if she wants to stay there could be seen as a bit of a ultimatum. The key here is whether the author is being reasonable. Staying with in-laws can be stressful, and two nights might not be too long, but the lack of privacy is a valid concern. The author is also considering their mother's feelings, showing they care about family dynamics.\n\nHowever, the author's response of making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants to avoid the parents could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Communication is key in such situations. Instead of an ultimatum, discussing compromises might have been better. The author's refusal to budge and the threat to leave the fianc\u00e9 with her own family could escalate tensions further.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting to a two-night stay. But if the family environment is indeed overwhelming, her request for a hotel is reasonable. The author's financial considerations are valid too, especially if they're saving for a house. The mention of the fianc\u00e9's family's expensive wedding might be a red herring or a way to justify the author's stance, but it's not directly related to the current issue.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both have valid points. The author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to stay with parents and being frugal, but their approach\u2014making the fianc\u00e9 pay the whole bill\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. It's a matter of balancing personal preferences and financial responsibility while respecting each other's needs. Since the author is standing their ground without finding a middle ground, it's possible they are contributing to the conflict. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
