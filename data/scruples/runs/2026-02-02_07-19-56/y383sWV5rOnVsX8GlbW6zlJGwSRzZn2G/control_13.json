We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 couple planning a Christmas visit. The author is saying they want to stay with the fianc\u00e9's parents and not pay for a hotel, while the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy. The author argues it's only two nights and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels abandoned, and there's a financial argument too, since the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding and the author is trying to save for a house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that staying with parents is cheaper and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9 feels smothered and wants privacy. The author is not willing to pay for the hotel, leading to conflict. The fianc\u00e9 is accusing the author of being selfish. The author is frustrated because the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, which is expensive, and the author wants to save for a house.\n\nIs the author wrong for expecting the fianc\u00e9 to stay with their parents? Maybe not entirely, since it's a common practice to visit the partner's family. But the author is being rigid. The fianc\u00e9 has a valid point about privacy, especially if others are coming too. The author is not budging, insisting the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel. The financial argument adds another layer. The author is saving for a house, but the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding regardless. So, the author might be prioritizing their savings over the fianc\u00e9's comfort, leading to the conflict.\n\nBut the author is also considering their parents' feelings and the short duration. The fianc\u00e9's frustration is about feeling abandoned. Maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like splitting the cost or suggesting a compromise. By not being flexible, the author might be seen as selfish. However, the fianc\u00e9 is not contributing to the hotel cost, which the author is standing their ground on. \n\nSo, considering the points, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have valid reasons (cost, tradition, parents' feelings). But the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy is also valid. The author's refusal to find a compromise might be the issue. But since the author is not willing to pay for the hotel and is asking the fianc\u00e9 to do so, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset about it, maybe the author is not wrong but could have handled it better. However, in the context of AITA, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're trying to manage finances and have done this before. The fianc\u00e9's demands might be seen as unreasonable given their own parents are covering the wedding costs. So, answer B (No).\n"
