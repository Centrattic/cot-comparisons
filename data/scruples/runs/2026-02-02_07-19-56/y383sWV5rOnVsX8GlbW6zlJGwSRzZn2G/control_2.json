We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) in a situation where they made their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel during a Christmas visit to their parents. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 planned to visit the author's parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel for two nights instead of at the parents' house. The author resists, saying they won't pay for the hotel and will stay with the parents instead. The fianc\u00e9 gets upset, accuses the author of being selfish and abandoning them, and even brings up the wedding costs where the author's parents are paying for a big wedding while the author is trying to save for a house.\n\nThe key points here are about compromise and financial responsibility. The author is concerned about spending money on a hotel for just two nights, especially since they've stayed at the parents' house before. The fianc\u00e9 is wanting privacy, which is valid, but the author is pushing back because of the cost. The author also mentions that the fianc\u00e9's parents are covering most of the wedding expenses, which is a separate issue, but the author is trying to save for a house. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The story says the author is asking the fianc\u00e9 to cover the hotel cost if she wants it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about this financial arrangement, but the author's reasoning is about being responsible with their shared finances. The argument here is about financial priorities. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a significant long-term investment. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might value privacy and mental health during a visit to a family that can be overwhelming. \n\nBut the main question is about making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel. The author is not forcing them to stay with the parents, but instead saying that if the fianc\u00e9 wants the hotel, she should pay for it. That seems like a logical stance if the author is not willing to spend the money. However, the author might be seen as not being considerate of the fianc\u00e9's comfort and privacy needs. The fianc\u00e9's complaint about privacy is valid, especially if there are other guests and the family is loud. The author is prioritizing saving money over their partner's well-being, which could be selfish from the fianc\u00e9's perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a position where they want to be financially responsible, especially given the wedding's high costs. They might feel that their partner is not appreciating their efforts to save. But is it fair to make the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel? If the fianc\u00e9 is against the idea of the big wedding and the author's parents are covering it, maybe the author is trying to balance that by not spending on the hotel. However, the argument could also be that the couple should split the expenses, or that the author is being inflexible by not offering a middle ground, like sharing the hotel cost if it's necessary for the fianc\u00e9's well-being. \n\nSo, the author's action (making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel) isn't inherently wrong, but the way the issue is framed might affect the perception. The author is standing their ground on financial matters, which is reasonable, but not considering the emotional aspect of their partner's request. The fianc\u00e9's need for privacy could be a legitimate concern that the author should address, perhaps by finding a compromise. The author's threat to have the fianc\u00e9 go to her own family might be seen as an ultimatum, which is not helpful. \n\nIn terms of AITA, it's a bit of a toss-up. The author is not wrong for wanting to save money, but they might be wrong for not valuing their partner's emotional needs equally. The fianc\u00e9's anger might be justified if the author is unwilling to even consider splitting the cost or finding a cheaper option. The author's justification about the wedding and the house is a valid point, but the way the conflict is handled (fighting and ultimatums) could be the issue here. \n\nSo, if the author is in the wrong, it's because they are prioritizing financial concerns over their partner's need for privacy and comfort without a middle ground. But if not, it's because they are being responsible with their money. The answer might depend on cultural norms or how the couple usually shares expenses. However, since the author is in a relationship, mutual respect and compromise are essential. Making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel to avoid the parents might be seen as selfish if the author is not willing to meet them halfway. Therefore, the answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are not allowing for compromise and are making their partner feel unsupported.\n"
