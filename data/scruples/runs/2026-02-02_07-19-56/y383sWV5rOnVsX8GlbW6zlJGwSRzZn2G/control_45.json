We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel during Christmas instead of at the author's parents' house. The author thinks two nights isn't a big deal and doesn't want to pay for the hotel. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about not having privacy and feels the author is being selfish. The author is also dealing with family dynamics, like his mother's feelings and a large, strong-willed family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's fianc\u00e9 is asking for privacy, which is a valid concern. Even if the stay is only two nights, not having privacy can make the experience stressful, especially with other guests around. The author, on the other hand, is concerned about money and wants to save for a house, which is also a reasonable goal. He's also considering his parents' feelings, which shows he values family time.\n\nThe author's decision to make the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants to stay there seems like a way to compromise. But maybe the problem is that the author isn't acknowledging the validity of her request. Insisting that she pay might come off as dismissive, even if he's trying to save money. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that her needs are being ignored, especially since she's already stressed about family expectations and the wedding costs. \n\nAlso, the author's threat to have her go to her own family might be seen as extreme. While he's frustrated, cutting off contact entirely could be hurtful and isn't a constructive solution. The arguments about money and priorities might be contributing to the tension here. The fianc\u00e9 could feel that her needs aren't being prioritized when she's already dealing with her parents' extravagant wedding plans.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to manage finances responsibly. He's saving for a home, which is a big investment. His parents are part of his life, and he might feel that staying with them is the norm based on past experiences. He's also dealing with the stress of family expectations and his mother's potential hurt feelings. \n\nBut maybe the key point is communication. The author could have tried to understand the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy better and found a middle ground instead of making a firm financial decision. Making her pay might not resolve the underlying issue and instead creates a power struggle. The fianc\u00e9's frustration might stem from feeling that her partner isn't supportive of her need for space during a stressful time.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's stance on saving money is valid, but so is the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy. The problem arises when the author's solution (her paying for the hotel) turns into a conflict. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because he's not compromising effectively. Instead of finding a solution that respects both their needs, he's forcing her to bear the cost, which might not be fair or supportive of their relationship's harmony.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison to her parents' wedding costs. If her parents are spending a lot on the wedding, but the author is focused on saving for a house, perhaps there's a deeper issue about shared values and priorities. The author's fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner isn't considering her well-being in the present moment (Christmas privacy) in favor of future financial goals. \n\nIn conclusion, while both sides have valid points, the author might be in the wrong because he's not adequately addressing the fianc\u00e9's emotional needs. The financial decision is one aspect, but the way it's handled could be seen as dismissive. Relationships require compromise, and the author's approach might not be fostering that. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not effectively balancing his fianc\u00e9's needs with his own.\n"
