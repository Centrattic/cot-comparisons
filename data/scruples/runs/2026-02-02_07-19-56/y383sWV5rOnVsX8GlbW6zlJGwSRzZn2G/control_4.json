We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for a hotel instead of staying with their parents on Christmas.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple plans to visit the author's parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel for two nights because of lack of privacy. The author thinks staying with the parents is fine, especially since they've done it before, and the parents are upset about not seeing them often. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, says they're abandoning her, and argues about money related to the wedding and house savings.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider. They're both adults in a relationship. The author's parents are hosting, which can be stressful, and the author might be trying to maintain family traditions or avoid conflict. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid, but two nights is a short time. The author's stance is that they don't want to spend money on a hotel, which is their prerogative. However, asking the fianc\u00e9 to pay if she wants privacy could be seen as a fair compromise. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about money and feels slighted, but the author is also saving for a house, which is a future goal.\n\nConflict arises from differing priorities: the author values family time and saving money, the fianc\u00e9 values privacy and possibly feels the author is not supportive. The author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with the parents; they're offering to go to the hotel if she pays. That seems fair. But the fianc\u00e9 might see it as the author not being considerate of her needs. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're making a reasonable request to save money, especially with financial goals in mind. The fianc\u00e9's frustration is valid, but the author isn't obliging the hotel stay. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
