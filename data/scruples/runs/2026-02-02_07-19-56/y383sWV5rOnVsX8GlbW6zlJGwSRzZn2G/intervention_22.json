We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their fianc\u00e9 arguing about staying with his parents during Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy, but the author refuses to pay for it. He makes her pay herself if she wants the hotel, and they fight about it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and that the author is being selfish. The author is frustrated that she's overreacting to two nights and mentions his mom's feelings. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the fianc\u00e9's request for privacy versus the author's financial responsibility. The author is trying to save money for a house, while the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel. The author is essentially saying she can have the hotel if she pays for it. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting her to pay if she wants that option? Well, it's their money, as they're engaged. But then again, maybe they should have discussed this earlier. The author might be being inflexible. Two nights might not seem long, but if the parents' house is crowded, the fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid. The author is also considering his mom's feelings, which is important. However, maybe he's not considering the fianc\u00e9's comfort enough.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset because he's making her choose between her comfort and his parents' feelings. The author's stance is that he's saving money, but maybe he's not being empathetic. The argument about the wedding costs\u2014she's not paying for it, so that part might be a red herring. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have suggested a middle ground, like a cheaper hotel or a compromise. By making her pay but not offering another solution, he's putting her in a tough spot. Also, accusing her of overreacting might hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to manage his finances, especially if they're planning to buy a house. But maybe there's a lack of understanding here. Both sides have valid points, but the author's approach might be too rigid. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not being flexible and is causing conflict over a reasonable request. He should have found a way to address both the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy and his own financial concerns. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
