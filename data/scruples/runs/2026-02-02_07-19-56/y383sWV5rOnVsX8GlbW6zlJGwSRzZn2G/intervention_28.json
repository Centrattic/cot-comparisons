We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for a hotel by herself during Christmas. The situation involves staying with the author's parents versus getting a hotel. \n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel because there's no privacy at the parents' house. The author refuses to pay for it, insisting on staying with the parents. The author's reasoning is that it's only two nights and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and that the author is being selfish. The author mentions financial issues, wanting to save for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for an expensive wedding.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's stance is about saving money and maintaining tradition. The fianc\u00e9's stance is about wanting privacy and feeling the author isn't supportive. The author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because they don't want to spend money on it. But is it fair for the author to make the fianc\u00e9 foot the bill just because they disagree with the expense? \n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship can be tricky. The author is prioritizing their own goals (saving for a house) over the fianc\u00e9's comfort. However, the fianc\u00e9's parents are covering the wedding costs, which the author doesn't have to worry about. That might be a point in the author's favor, but it's not directly related to the hotel situation. \n\nThe author's refusal to compromise could be seen as selfish, especially if the fianc\u00e9's main concern is valid (privacy issues). The author is not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings and is insisting on their own way, which could strain the relationship. Making someone pay for their own choice when it's a shared expense (like a trip) might not be fair, even if the author is saving money. The fianc\u00e9 is paying for the hotel to avoid an uncomfortable situation, but the author is not supporting that choice financially, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be right about the two-night stay not being a big deal, but the emotional impact on the fianc\u00e9 is significant. Relationships require compromise, and the author's stance seems rigid here. They could have suggested alternative solutions, like splitting the cost or finding a cheaper option, but instead forced the fianc\u00e9 to pay fully or not go. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible and making the fianc\u00e9 bear the cost alone when the fianc\u00e9's concern is valid. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
