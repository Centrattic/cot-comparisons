We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for a hotel because she doesn't want to stay with his parents over Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy, but it's only two nights. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and says she should foot the bill if she wants to stay there. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and that he's acting childish. She's also bringing up the wedding costs and her parents paying for it, while he's trying to save for a house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's stance is that staying with parents is the norm, especially for just two nights, and he doesn't want to spend money on a hotel. He's also concerned about his mom's feelings and the family dynamics, which he mentions are already complicated. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is looking for privacy and comfort, which is understandable, especially if the parents' house is crowded. She's also frustrated that he's not considering her needs and is making her pay for the hotel, even though she's not the one funding the wedding.\n\nThe author's argument is that the hotel is unnecessary, but privacy is a valid concern. Two nights might not seem long, but if the fianc\u00e9 feels uncomfortable due to the family's strong personalities, it's a real issue. The author is also using the hotel cost as leverage, which could be seen as a tactic to pressure her into staying with his parents. The fianc\u00e9's anger comes from feeling unconsidered and maybe feeling like her needs are being dismissed. \n\nAnother point is the mention of the wedding costs. The author's fianc\u00e9 is not paying for anything, her parents are covering most of it, which the author is okay with. However, he's trying to save for a house. The fianc\u00e9 is bringing up the wedding costs as a counterpoint, which might indicate she feels her contributions (or lack thereof) aren't being acknowledged. The author's response is to shift the financial responsibility of the hotel to her, which might not be fair since they are a couple and should be sharing expenses.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author is not willing to compromise on the hotel, which might be seen as selfish. He's not considering her needs and is using the fight as a way to make her stay with his parents. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, while maybe intense, is a reaction to feeling unheard. The author's ultimatum to let her go to her family is extreme, but he hasn't followed through yet. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not wrong entirely because wanting to stay with family is normal, but he's not being flexible. The fianc\u00e9 is also not wrong for wanting privacy. However, the author is making her pay for the hotel, which could be seen as unfair, especially if they usually split costs. The fact that he's using the hotel as a bargaining chip might be the issue. He's not considering her feelings and is being rigid. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
