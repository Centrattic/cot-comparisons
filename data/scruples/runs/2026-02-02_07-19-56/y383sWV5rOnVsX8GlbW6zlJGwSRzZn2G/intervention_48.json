We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their fianc\u00e9 disagreeing on where to stay during Christmas when visiting his parents.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy, even though it's only two nights. The author is willing to stay at his parents' house but insists the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants to stay there. The fianc\u00e9 gets upset, accuses him of being selfish and a child, and brings up the wedding costs. The author is frustrated because his parents' house is crowded, and he's saving for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding.\n\nHmm. So, the author is setting a boundary by saying he's not spending money on the hotel and is willing to split up if needed. But is that fair? On one hand, the author is within his rights to set financial boundaries. He's trying to save money for a home, which is a significant life goal. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is voicing a legitimate need for privacy, which is understandable, especially in a relationship where such needs are valid. \n\nThe author's response is to make the fianc\u00e9 pay the entire bill if she wants the hotel. That could be seen as a reasonable compromise if they can't agree. However, the author's tone comes across as dismissive of her concerns, maybe minimizing the two-night privacy issue. The fianc\u00e9 feels smothered by the author's family, and while the author acknowledges that the family has strong personalities, he downplays it by saying it's only two nights. \n\nAlso, the author mentions his mother's feelings, which adds another layer of emotional complexity. The fianc\u00e9 might feel like her needs are being sacrificed for the author's family dynamics. The argument about the wedding costs might be a red herring, but it shows the fianc\u00e9 feels the author isn't contributing as much as he should, which could be a point of contention. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the author is unwilling to compromise and insists on his terms without considering his fianc\u00e9's emotional needs, that's a problem. However, if he's trying to manage finances and set boundaries, he has a point. The key issue is communication and respect. The author's approach might be seen as selfish if he's not showing empathy towards his fianc\u00e9's needs. But if he's standing by his financial decisions and being clear, maybe not. The answer might hinge on whether the author is being reasonable in expecting her to pay for the hotel while also not wanting to stay with his parents. Maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how he handled the situation. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries, but there's a nuance here. Wait, but if the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable, and he's not budging without considering alternatives... Hmm. Maybe A? I'm a bit torn. The initial thought was the author is in the wrong, but upon reflection, maybe not. The fianc\u00e9's need for privacy is valid, but the author's right to set financial terms is also valid. So maybe B.\n"
