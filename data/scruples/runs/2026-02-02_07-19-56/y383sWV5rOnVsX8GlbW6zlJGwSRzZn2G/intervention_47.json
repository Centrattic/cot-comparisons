We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author says they've done this before and stayed at the parents' house, but this time the fianc\u00e9 is refusing. The main points are about privacy, cost, and family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because there's no privacy at the parents' house, and there are other guests. The author thinks it's only two nights and is reluctant to pay for a hotel. The author then tells the fianc\u00e9 she has to pay for it herself if she wants to stay in a hotel. They argue, and the fianc\u00e9 accuses the author of being selfish. The author is considering telling the fianc\u00e9 to go to her own family but is hesitant.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Privacy is a valid concern. Even two nights without privacy can be stressful, especially if the family is loud or has strong personalities. The author's parents might be well-meaning, but the fianc\u00e9's comfort is part of the relationship. The author is prioritizing saving money for a house, which is a long-term goal, but maybe underestimates the importance of the fianc\u00e9's emotional needs during a holiday. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is already dealing with their mother's feelings. The fianc\u00e9 is not paying for the wedding; the author's in-laws are. The author is trying to save, which is understandable. But maybe the author is being inflexible. Compromise might be needed here. Offering to split the hotel cost, or finding a way to make the parents' stay more private (like a separate part of the house, maybe) could be solutions. Instead, the author is taking a firm stance that the fianc\u00e9 must pay, leading to a fight. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's only two nights, but the fianc\u00e9's stress about privacy might outweigh that. Relationships require giving and taking. The author could be seen as not being considerate of the fianc\u00e9's feelings, especially since the fianc\u00e9 is already stressed about the wedding costs. The author's response is a bit harsh, making the fianc\u00e9 pay, especially when the author is the one saving for a house. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not being flexible and for making the fianc\u00e9 bear the cost, leading to a fight. The answer should be A.\n"
