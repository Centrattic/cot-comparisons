We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (ITA) for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself because she doesn't want to stay with the author's parents during Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's side: They usually stay with their parents, which the fianc\u00e9 has done before. This time, the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights, cites lack of privacy, and the author is reluctant to spend money. The author is also concerned about their mother's feelings and the family's strong personalities causing stress. They offer to go to the hotel if the fianc\u00e9 can pay for it, which leads to a fight. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being selfish, especially since the author's parents are hosting a big wedding that's expensive, while the author is trying to save for a house.\n\nOn the fianc\u00e9's side, she might feel that privacy is important, even if it's just two nights. Family dynamics can be tough, especially with \"strong personalities\" and potential smothering. She might expect the author to share the cost since they are a couple and planning a wedding. The author's refusal to split the cost could be seen as not considering her comfort, especially during a holiday. The mention of the wedding's cost and the author's savings for a house adds complexity\u2014maybe she feels the author is prioritizing their house over her comfort now, even if the wedding is being paid by her parents.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's only two nights, and they want to avoid extra expenses. But the fianc\u00e9's discomfort and the potential for a stressful holiday with her future in-laws might be valid. The key point is whether the author was selfish in not compromising. Since the author is in a relationship, mutual respect and compromise are important. Refusing to pay for the hotel might be seen as not being considerate of her feelings, especially if the parents' wedding plans are already causing financial strain. The author might be trying to save, but the fianc\u00e9 could feel she's being made to choose between her comfort and the author's financial goals without a middle ground.\n\nAlso, the author's parents are paying for the wedding, so maybe there's an expectation that the author is contributing less, but the author is saving for a house. However, the fianc\u00e9's argument is that she's spending on the wedding, so the author should contribute to the hotel stay. It's a bit of a conflict between current financial priorities and the partner's comfort. The author's solution of making her pay for the hotel might be a way to avoid spending money, but could it be unfair? The answer might depend on the couple's usual financial arrangements. If they're supposed to be a team, the author might be in the wrong for not sharing the cost, even if it's minimal. The fact that the author is willing to go to the hotel if she pays could be seen as a bit of a loophole, making the fianc\u00e9 feel like she has to cover it alone. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not being more accommodating and for not sharing the cost of the hotel, even if the reason is financial. Relationships require giving and taking, and the hotel is a small expense compared to the wedding. The answer is probably AITA, so the choice would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
