We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nSo the setup is that the couple is going to visit the author's parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel instead of at the parents' house, citing lack of privacy. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, insisting on staying with the parents, and offers to go to the hotel only if the fianc\u00e9 pays. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels abandoned, and there's a bigger fight about money and the wedding. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a significant financial goal. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is choosing to stay with the author's parents but is upset about it. The author's parents are hosting, which is common in many cultures, and the author is probably trying to be considerate of their parents' feelings. The fianc\u00e9's complaint is about privacy, which is valid, but the stay is only two nights. The author is willing to compromise if the fianc\u00e9 pays, which might be a fair stance since it's her choice to opt out of staying with the in-laws.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's anger seems to stem from feeling that the author is being selfish, but the author's position is that they're trying to manage finances responsibly. The mention of the wedding costs adds another layer\u2014perhaps the fianc\u00e9 feels the author isn't contributing as much as expected, but it's clarified that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, not her. The author is handling their own financial priorities.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is being unreasonable. Insisting on staying with family to save money isn't inherently wrong, especially when they've done it before. Offering to go to the hotel if she pays is a compromise. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be overblown, especially if the author is being firm in their financial planning. The author's concern about the mother's feelings and the extended family's dynamics also plays a role here. \n\nHowever, it's possible that the author isn't considering the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy enough. Two nights might seem short, but if the situation is particularly stressful or uncomfortable, that could justify the hotel. The author's refusal to split the cost or find a middle ground might come off as inconsiderate, especially if the fianc\u00e9 is genuinely stressed about the stay.\n\nBut given the financial context\u2014saving for a house\u2014and that the author is the one covering the hotel cost unless the fianc\u00e9 chooses to pay, the author isn't necessarily wrong. It's a matter of priorities. The author is setting boundaries around their finances, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's frustration might be more about feeling that her needs aren't being met rather than the author being outright wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether there's a clear wrongdoer. Here, the author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with the parents; they're giving her the choice to pay for the hotel herself. That seems fair. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their financial goals and being honest about it. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be an overreaction based on her own stress or expectations.\n"
