We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged and plans to visit their parents for Christmas, which they've done before by staying at the parents' house. This time, their fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel instead, citing lack of privacy since other guests will be there. The author thinks two nights isn't long enough to justify a hotel and doesn't want to pay for it, so they told the fianc\u00e9 to pay if she wants to go that route. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and accuses the author of being selfish. The author is considering cutting things off but hasn't because they think it might escalate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy, which is a valid concern. Family dynamics can be stressful, and if the parents have strong personalities, that could make the stay uncomfortable. The author's point about it being only two nights is valid too, but that doesn't negate the other person's feelings. \n\nThe author's stance is about not spending money on a hotel and insisting the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants it. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels her needs aren't being considered. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a costly wedding, while the author is saving for a house. There's a sense of financial responsibility here, but maybe the author isn't considering emotional needs.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author is rigid in their position, not offering a middle ground. For example, maybe splitting the hotel cost or finding a more affordable option. By not being flexible, the author is prioritizing their own preferences and financial concerns over the fianc\u00e9's comfort. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be intense, but the author's refusal to budge could be seen as selfish, especially if staying with the parents is causing significant stress.\n\nAlso, the author's threat to send the fianc\u00e9 to her own family is a possible overreaction. It might be a way to avoid conflict, but it's not a mature solution. The author should address the issue without ultimatums. The fact that the author is trying to save for a house is commendable, but relationships require balancing practicality with emotional support.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both have valid points, but the author's refusal to meet in the middle might make them at fault. The fianc\u00e9's desire for privacy is understandable, and the author's strict stance could be seen as not valuing her feelings. The financial aspect is a red herring; the main issue is about mutual respect and compromise. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
