We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author and their fianc\u00e9 disagreeing on where to stay for Christmas\u2014either at the author's parents' house or in a hotel. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and is telling the fianc\u00e9 to pay if she wants that, while the fianc\u00e9 is upset and thinks the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have stayed at the parents' house before, which worked for two nights. The fianc\u00e9 feels there's no privacy because there will be other guests. The author is concerned about the mother's hurt feelings and saving money for a house. The fianc\u00e9 mentions that her parents are paying for the wedding, which the author is trying to save money on, but the author's parents have never complained about their financial contributions. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and the author is considering cutting ties temporarily but doesn't want to risk conflict.\n\nSo, the author's stance is that it's only two nights, and they don't want to spend extra money on a hotel. The fianc\u00e9 wants the privacy and is upset about the cost. The author is trying to save for a house, while the author's parents are covering the wedding costs. The main conflict is about who should pay for the hotel. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, it's important to consider both partners' needs and feelings. The fianc\u00e9's request for a hotel is about privacy and comfort, which are valid concerns. The author's argument is about minimizing expenses and not wanting to upset the mother, but two nights in a hotel might be a reasonable expense for the sake of the relationship. The author's refusal to even consider splitting the cost or compromising could be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, but that's a different matter. The author's mention of saving for a house is a personal financial goal, but it's not necessarily the fianc\u00e9's issue. \n\nThe author might be prioritizing their own financial savings and their parents' feelings over their fianc\u00e9's comfort and well-being. While it's only two nights, if the fianc\u00e9 is truly uncomfortable and this is leading to a major fight, the author might be being too inflexible. The fact that they have a history of staying at the parents' house doesn't mean the fianc\u00e9 can't have a legitimate reason to want a different arrangement this year. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also trying to manage their finances and not see their parents hurt. However, the way the author is handling it\u2014by making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely and considering cutting her off\u2014could be seen as extreme. Compromise is key in relationships, so if the author is unwilling to meet halfway, that might be the issue. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's anger is understandable if she feels that the author is not respecting her needs or the effort she's making. The author's response to the financial aspect (mentioning the wedding costs) might not be relevant here, as the hotel is a separate expense. \n\nSo, in this case, the author's rigidity and the way they're assigning blame to the fianc\u00e9 for wanting privacy might be the problem. They could be in the wrong if their approach is causing unnecessary strain in the relationship. The answer is probably A, but I need to check the reasoning again. The author is prioritizing their own priorities (saving money, not upsetting parents) over their partner's, which can be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely and threatening to split up if she doesn't comply is a red flag. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise. So yes, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
