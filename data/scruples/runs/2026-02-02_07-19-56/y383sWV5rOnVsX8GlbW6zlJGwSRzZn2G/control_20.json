We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because she didn't want to stay with his parents during Christmas.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9 are visiting his parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights because she feels uncomfortable with the lack of privacy at the parents' house, especially since there are other guests. The author is against the hotel, arguing it's only two nights and they've done this before. He also mentions his mother's feelings might be hurt. He insists the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants to go that route. She gets angry, accusing him of being selfish and childlike, and brings up the wedding costs where her parents are covering most, while the author is saving for a house. Now, they're fighting, and the author is considering cutting her off during the holiday.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. \n\nThe author is standing by their decision to stay with the parents, which is a valid choice. However, when he says the fianc\u00e9 should pay for the hotel, that's where conflict arises. The fianc\u00e9's request is about her comfort and privacy, which is understandable. The author seems dismissive of her feelings, especially given the family's strong personalities. His response of making her pay could come off as punitive, especially if he's not willing to compromise. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's complaint about the wedding costs is mentioned. The author points out that her parents are paying, but she's not contributing. However, the author is saving money for a house. This might be a red herring, but it shows there's underlying tension about financial contributions from both sides. \n\nThe key issue here is communication and compromise. The author is not wrong in wanting to be with his family and saving money, but he might be inconsiderate of his fianc\u00e9's needs. Making her pay could be seen as shaming her for her preferences, especially if the hotel is a reasonable compromise. The author's refusal to budge and insistence on her covering the cost could be the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is also intense, accusing him of abandonment and childishness. But her feelings about privacy are valid. The author might not be entirely wrong, but his approach is likely part of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to find middle ground. The author could have suggested finding a balance, like splitting the hotel cost or finding a nearby hotel for her to have some alone time while he visits his parents. Instead, he took a hard stance, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, while the author has his reasons, his method of handling the situation\u2014demanding she pay without considering compromise\u2014might make him at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
