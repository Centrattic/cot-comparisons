We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house during Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and is making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants to go that route.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've stayed at their parents' house before. This time the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights, mainly because of privacy issues and the presence of other guests. The author's parents are likely hosting multiple guests, which is why the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered. The author is frustrated because it's only two nights and they don't want to spend the money. They also mention that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding, which the author is trying to counter by saving for a house.\n\nThe author stands their ground by saying if the fianc\u00e9 wants the hotel, she has to pay. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and accused the author of being selfish. The author is considering cutting things off but is hesitant.\n\nNow, considering the points: The fianc\u00e9's request is for her own comfort, which is valid. The author's concern about cost is understandable, especially if they're saving for a house. However, making the fianc\u00e9 pay for her own choice might be seen as unfair, even if the author isn't willing to spend the money. The author is prioritizing their parents' preferences and their financial goals over the fianc\u00e9's comfort. The fianc\u00e9's parents are already covering the wedding costs, so maybe the author's stance on splitting the hotel cost is inconsistent if they're not contributing to the wedding.\n\nBut the author is also within their rights to set boundaries about their finances. However, the way they handled it\u2014threatening to leave the fianc\u00e9 there\u2014might be seen as harsh. The key issue is whether the author is respecting the fianc\u00e9's needs versus their own. Since it's a mutual decision, the author's refusal to compromise could be problematic. The fianc\u00e9's feelings about privacy and comfort are valid, and the author's insistence on staying with parents despite her discomfort might be the issue here. So, the author might be in the wrong because they're not considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective enough and are being rigid about the finances when it's their own choice to stay with the parents. Answer A.\n"
