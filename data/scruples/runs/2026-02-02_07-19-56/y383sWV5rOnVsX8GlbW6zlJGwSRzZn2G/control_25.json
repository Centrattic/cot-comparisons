We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9 who insisted on staying at the hotel and made his fianc\u00e9e pay) is in the wrong. So, first, I need to look at both sides.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they've stayed at the parents' house before, and this is only two nights. He's worried about his mom's feelings and the family's strong personalities making the fianc\u00e9e uncomfortable. But he's not willing to pay for the hotel, making her pay if she wants it. He also mentions financial stress because the fianc\u00e9e's parents are paying for an expensive wedding, while he's trying to save for a house.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that she wants privacy and doesn't want to stay with in-laws. She's upset that he's making her pay for the hotel, especially since her parents are already spending on the wedding. She feels he's being selfish, not considering her comfort. The author is now questioning if he's wrong for that stance.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships require compromise. He's being firm on his stance but not considering her need for comfort. Making her pay for the hotel when she's already spending on the wedding might seem unfair. Also, the fact that the parents have different priorities (his vs hers) adds another layer. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, like splitting the cost or finding a middle ground, that could be seen as selfish. But maybe he's just trying to manage finances. However, the way he's handling it by making her pay entirely might come off as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the comment about abandoning her on Christmas is a red flag. Even if staying with parents is traditional, respecting her comfort is important. The fact that she's already stressed about the wedding and the family's expectations might make his refusal to compromise look worse. So, maybe the author is in the wrong here because he's not showing flexibility and is prioritizing his own preferences over her needs, especially when there's a way to meet in the middle. But I need to check if there's any justification. He's saving for a house, which is a big deal. But again, in a relationship, both partners' needs should be considered. The key is whether he's being overly rigid without empathy. Probably yes, he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
