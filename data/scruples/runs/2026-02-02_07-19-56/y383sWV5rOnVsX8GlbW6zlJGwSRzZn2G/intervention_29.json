We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel and insists on staying with the parents, even making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants the hotel. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and accusing the author of acting like a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that staying with parents is traditional, and it's only two nights. They also mention wanting to save money for a house since the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, wants privacy and feels smothered by the author's family, which has strong personalities. The author's parents might be hurt because they don't see them often, adding to the stress.\n\nThe author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants it, which seems selfish. Even though they mention trying to save money, the fianc\u00e9 is not paying for anything else, like the wedding. The author is being inflexible and not considering the fianc\u00e9's needs for privacy and comfort. Relationships require compromise, and by not budging, the author is causing conflict. Also, the author's threat to tell the fianc\u00e9 to go to her own family is extreme and could be seen as dismissive. \n\nHowever, the author is also trying to manage finances. But making the fianc\u00e9 pay for a hotel she wants is not fair. The key points are about respect, communication, and compromise. The author isn't being unreasonable in wanting to stay with family, but their approach is rigid and not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid, especially if the family is smothering. The author's refusal to split the cost or find a middle ground shows a lack of willingness to meet halfway, which is important in a relationship.\n\nSo, while both have valid points, the author's inflexibility and the way they're handling the financial aspect might make them at fault. The fianc\u00e9's feelings about privacy and the author's dismissive attitude towards her concerns could mean the author is in the wrong.\n"
