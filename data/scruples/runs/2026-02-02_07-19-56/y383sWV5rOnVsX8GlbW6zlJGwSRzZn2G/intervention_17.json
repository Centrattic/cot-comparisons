We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel during Christmas instead of the author's parents' house, leading to a conflict over who should pay.\n\nFirst, the author is not spending money on the hotel and insists on staying with his parents. His fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is upset about the arrangement. She wants him to pay for the hotel, but he refuses, saying she should cover it if she prefers that. She then accuses him of being selfish, and he's considering cutting her off but hasn't.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's two nights, and he's trying to save money for a house. He's also dealing with his family's dynamics, which might be stressful. The fianc\u00e9's main issue is privacy and feeling smothered. She might feel that the hotel is necessary for their comfort, even if it's a short stay.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not responsible for the hotel cost if she doesn't want to stay with his parents. However, in a relationship, especially close to marriage, shared expenses and mutual consideration are important. The fact that her parents are paying for a lavish wedding while the author is trying to save could add tension here.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being practical about finances and sticking to his family's traditions. On the other, the fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid, especially if the family is large or loud. The author's refusal to compromise might come off as dismissive of her needs. By making her pay, he's shifting the financial burden onto her, which she might not be okay with, especially if she's not the one paying for other things like the wedding.\n\nThe key points are communication and compromise. The author could have suggested a middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a hotel closer to his parents to minimize expenses. Instead, he took a rigid stance, leading to conflict. His fianc\u00e9's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a reaction to feeling ignored. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's refusal to share the hotel cost without any compromise might be seen as inconsiderate. While saving for a house is important, relationships also require flexibility. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his fianc\u00e9's feelings and needs adequately, and his approach to the financial aspect was seen as selfish.\n"
