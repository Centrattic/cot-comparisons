We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting to stay with the author's parents for Christmas and instead wants to stay in a hotel. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, so they're arguing about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author thinks staying with the parents is fine, even though there's not much privacy and others are there. They mention that it's only two nights, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset about privacy. The author's mom might be hurt because they don't see each other often. The author is also trying to save money for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding. The author is asking the fianc\u00e9 to pay for the hotel if she wants that.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are about respect, compromise, and financial responsibility. The author is standing their ground about not wanting to pay for the hotel, which could be seen as reasonable if they have financial goals. However, maybe they should have tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid too, especially if the parents are smothering. \n\nBut the author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with their parents, just saying they won't pay for the hotel. The author is also concerned about the fianc\u00e9's family's financial contributions to the wedding versus their own. The author's stance might be seen as selfish if they're dismissing the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy just to save money. On the flip side, the fianc\u00e9 could be overreacting to a short two-night stay. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have their own priorities. However, the way the argument escalated might be an issue. The author could have been more understanding of the fianc\u00e9's feelings. But the core issue is about differing priorities. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason to be frugal, but there's room for both to compromise. However, the author's refusal to consider the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns could be problematic. But since the question is if the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is B.\n"
