We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 and their partner planning to visit the fianc\u00e9's parents for Christmas. The partner wants to stay in a hotel instead of the parents' house because there's no privacy. The author (the fianc\u00e9) refuses to pay for the hotel, insisting on staying with the parents, and then makes the partner pay if they want to go to the hotel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that it's only two nights, so the privacy issue isn't that big. Also, the author mentions that the partner's parents are paying for a huge wedding they can't afford, and the author is trying to save for a house. That might explain why the author is reluctant to spend on a hotel. However, the partner is upset because they feel smothered and that the author isn't considering their feelings. The author even says they don't see their parents often, so maybe there's pressure to stay with them, leading to the mother's hurt feelings.\n\nI wonder if it's reasonable to expect a partner to stay with one's family for a couple of days. Privacy is important, and even two nights without privacy could be stressful, especially if the family is large or has strong personalities. The author's response of making the partner pay for the hotel themselves might be seen as unfair because they're not actually covering the cost themselves; instead, they're shifting the financial burden to the partner. The partner might feel that the author isn't willing to compromise or share the expense for their well-being.\n\nAlso, the argument about the wedding versus the hotel is a bit conflicting. The author mentions that the partner's parents are covering the wedding costs, so maybe there's a sense of imbalance. However, the author is now asking the partner to pay for the hotel, which could be seen as inconsistent. The partner might feel that the author isn't supporting them emotionally, even if financially they're not paying. The author's ultimatum to go with their parents or the hotel at the partner's expense seems harsh. It's possible the author isn't seeing the partner's perspective and is being rigid about an issue that affects the partner's comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might think they're being practical, saving money for a house, and trying to maintain family traditions. But in a relationship, compromise is key. If the partner is genuinely uncomfortable and the author isn't willing to meet in the middle, like splitting the hotel cost or finding a middle ground on where to stay, then the author might be at fault here. The author's response seems more about not wanting to spend money than about respecting the partner's needs. Making the partner pay might come across as selfish, especially since the partner isn't the one paying for the wedding.\n\nAnother angle: the author is suggesting that the partner could go to their own family, but that's not a solution if the partner wants to spend Christmas with the author. By not offering another option, the author is forcing the partner into an either/or situation, which isn't helpful. The author might be in the wrong because they're not being flexible and are prioritizing their own preferences and savings over the partner's comfort and emotional needs. Relationships require give and take, and the author's approach here seems to lack that balance.\n"
