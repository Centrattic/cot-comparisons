We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author and their fianc\u00e9 having a disagreement about where to stay for Christmas. The author wants to stay at their parents' house, which they've done before, but the fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel for privacy. The author insists that the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants to go that route. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and accuses the author of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that staying at their parents' place is the norm and they don't want to spend money on a hotel. They also mention that their mother will be hurt because they don't visit often. The fianc\u00e9's side is that she wants privacy, and she's upset that the author isn't willing to share the cost of the hotel, even though her parents are paying for the wedding, which is expensive.\n\nThe key points here are about compromise and financial responsibility. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a big financial goal. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, values her privacy and is willing to pay for it. The author's main argument is that if she wants a hotel, she should cover the cost, which seems fair because it's a preference she's insisting on. However, the author is also being rigid, not considering that maybe splitting the cost could be a middle ground. \n\nBut then again, the author is also in a position where they have to manage their finances carefully. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding, which might be a separate issue, but the author is trying to save. The author's stance is that the hotel is an unnecessary expense, especially since it's only two nights. However, the fianc\u00e9's feelings about privacy and the stress of dealing with family dynamics are valid too.\n\nI think the author isn't completely wrong because they have a right to set boundaries on their spending. However, the way the author approached it by making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely might come off as dismissive of her needs. The ideal situation would be a compromise, like splitting the cost or finding a cheaper option. But since the author didn't offer any middle ground and instead made it an all-or-nothing deal, that could be seen as selfish. But the fianc\u00e9 also didn't consider the author's financial goals when pushing for the hotel. \n\nOverall, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to pay, but they could have handled it better by finding a compromise. The answer might be B (No), as the author is standing up for their financial priorities, even if the approach was a bit harsh. But maybe there's a nuance where the author should have considered both sides more. Hmm, tricky. I think the author is not in the wrong because they are prioritizing their financial goals and are willing to let the fianc\u00e9 pay for her preference. So answer B.\n"
