We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is the fianc\u00e9 who's arguing with their partner about staying at their parents' house versus a hotel during Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, saying it's only two nights and the partner should just deal with their parents. The author's reasoning is that the partner is being overly sensitive about privacy and that the partner's own family is spending a lot on the wedding, so they should handle their own expenses.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about shared expenses and compromise in a relationship. The author is taking a stance on not paying for the hotel, which the partner wants. The author is being rigid, not considering the partner's feelings about privacy and comfort. Even though the stay is short, personal space is important, and the partner's discomfort is valid. The author is also bringing up the wedding expenses, which seems like a deflective argument. The partner isn't paying for the wedding themselves, so that comparison doesn't hold. \n\nThe author's main point is about saving money for a house, which is a future goal, but relationships require present compromises. The author isn't showing empathy towards the partner's stress about family dynamics and privacy. The fight escalated because the author didn't offer a middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a cheaper alternative. By making the partner pay entirely, the author is forcing them into a choice between their comfort and the author's budget, which isn't fair. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make concessions. The author's refusal to budge on such a specific issue might be seen as inconsiderate. While saving for a house is important, the immediate emotional impact and the partner's need for space should also be prioritized. The author is in the wrong here for not being flexible and not acknowledging the partner's feelings adequately.\n"
