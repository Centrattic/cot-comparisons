We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting to stay with the author's parents for Christmas and insisting on a hotel instead. The author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself because they don't want to spend the money, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's parents have hosted them before, and this year the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy. The author thinks two nights isn't a big deal and is okay with the parents' feelings being hurt. The fianc\u00e9 argues that the author is being selfish and not supportive, leading to a fight. The author is considering cutting off the visit entirely but hasn't yet.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. Now, I need to evaluate that. The key points are about compromise, respect in a relationship, financial responsibility, and family dynamics. \n\nThe author is prioritizing their own feelings about family visits and financial savings over the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy. The fianc\u00e9's request is about feeling comfortable and having space, which is understandable, especially with a large family with strong personalities. The author's response is to make the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel, which could be seen as a way to avoid the expense but also as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a factor here. The author is saving for a house, which is a long-term goal, but the fianc\u00e9's current need for privacy might be a short-term expense. However, in a relationship, shared expenses and mutual respect are important. The author's refusal to contribute to the hotel might be seen as selfish, especially if the fianc\u00e9 is willing to pay but feels it's unfair that the author won't contribute anything. \n\nThe mention of the wedding also adds context. The author's fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a large wedding, so there's a dynamic where the author is covering more of the immediate costs (like the hotel) while the fianc\u00e9 isn't contributing. The author is saving, which is practical, but expecting the fianc\u00e9 to bear the entire cost of the hotel could be seen as unfair, especially if they're planning to live together after the wedding. \n\nIn terms of communication, the author's ultimatum (\"you pay or I stay with my parents\") might not be a mature way to handle the situation. A better approach would be to discuss the budget and find a compromise. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered and the author dismisses it as \"two nights\" could indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. They're not respecting the fianc\u00e9's emotional needs and are prioritizing their own financial goals over the relationship's harmony. The author's stance might come across as selfish, especially given the context of the previous wedding expenses and the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about family dynamics. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong). The key factors are the lack of compromise, dismissive attitude towards the fianc\u00e9's needs, and the ultimatum that caused conflict.\n"
