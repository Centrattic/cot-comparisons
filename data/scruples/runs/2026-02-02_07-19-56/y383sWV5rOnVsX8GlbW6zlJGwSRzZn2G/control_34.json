We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for making his fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because she doesn't want to stay with his parents on Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is saying that they usually stay with his parents, but this time his fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel. He's frustrated because it's only two nights and he's worried about his mother's feelings. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because there's no privacy at his parents' house and he's making her pay for the hotel.\n\nSo, the main points are about privacy, financial responsibility, and family dynamics. The author is trying to save money to buy a house, while the fianc\u00e9 is spending a lot on her parents' wedding. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for making her pay.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting costs is common for shared expenses. However, the author is making her pay the entire bill, which might be seen as unfair if they were planning to split it. But maybe he's standing his ground because he doesn't want to spend money on a hotel. \n\nEmotionally, the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered by his family, which is valid. The author is prioritizing family traditions and saving money. There's a conflict between their values. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If the fianc\u00e9 agreed to the terms before the trip, maybe not. But if he unilaterally changed the plan and forced her to pay, that could be inconsiderate. Also, the author is using the fact that her family is paying for the wedding as a counterpoint, which might be a red herring.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe they should have discussed and compromised earlier. The author's stance is rigid, not considering her feelings about privacy. He's also dismissing her concerns by saying it's only two nights, which might minimize her valid stress.\n\nSo, the answer could be A because the author isn't showing enough empathy and is making her pay without compromise. But some might argue that he's being reasonable to save money. However, forcing her to pay the full amount without negotiation seems unfair. Hence, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
