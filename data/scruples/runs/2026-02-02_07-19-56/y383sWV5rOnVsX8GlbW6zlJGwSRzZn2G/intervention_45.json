We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting to stay with the author's parents over Christmas and instead wants a hotel. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and is making the fianc\u00e9 cover the cost.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights because of privacy issues with the parents' house. The author is against it, not wanting to spend money, and says she should pay. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned and that the author is being selfish. Also, there's context about the fianc\u00e9's parents wanting an expensive wedding that the author can't afford, but they're paying for most of it. The author is saving for a house.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me think. The author is making a financial decision, but is it fair? The fianc\u00e9 has a valid reason for wanting privacy, even if it's just two nights. The author's stance that she should pay if she wants the hotel might be seen as reasonable, but maybe the approach was harsh. Also, the author mentioned that the fianc\u00e9 isn't actually paying for the wedding, her parents are, so maybe that's a red herring. \n\nThe author's motivation is saving for a house, which is understandable. However, insisting that the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel when she's not the one spending money on the wedding might be seen as unfair. The author could be being selfish by not compromising. The fianc\u00e9's complaint about being smothered by the author's family might be valid too. \n\nBut then, the author is trying to save money. However, relationships require compromise. The author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for her preference, but maybe that's not the right way to handle it. If the author is unwilling to spend money on the hotel, maybe they should have found a middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a cheaper option. \n\nOn the flip side, the author's parents are important, and maybe the author feels obligated to stay with them. But the fianc\u00e9's comfort is also a factor. The author's response of making her pay might be seen as selfish because it's a shared holiday. The author is prioritizing their own savings over the fianc\u00e9's comfort, which could hurt the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're enforcing a financial responsibility on the fianc\u00e9 without considering the relationship's need for mutual support. The fact that the author is saving for a house is a good reason, but the way they're handling it by making the fianc\u00e9 pay could be seen as unfair. The answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because they're not compromising and are placing the financial burden on the fianc\u00e9 for a valid reason.\n"
