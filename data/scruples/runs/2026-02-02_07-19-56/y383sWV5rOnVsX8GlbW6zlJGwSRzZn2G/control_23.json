We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house during Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and is insisting on staying with their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is planning to visit their parents for Christmas, which they've done before. This year, the fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel due to lack of privacy. The author argues that it's only two nights and that they don't want to spend money on a hotel. The fianc\u00e9 gets upset, accuses the author of being selfish and abandoning her. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 isn't paying for the wedding but her parents are, while the author is saving for a house. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they might feel that since they're the ones saving for a house and the parents are already covering the wedding, they shouldn't have to pay for the hotel. They might see staying with parents as the more economical choice, especially since they've done it before. Also, the author is concerned about their mother's feelings, which adds another layer of family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is seeking privacy and a more comfortable holiday experience. The author's refusal to pay for the hotel could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's needs, even if the author has financial reasons. The author's response of making the fianc\u00e9 pay herself might come across as punitive, especially if the fianc\u00e9 is already under stress about the wedding costs.\n\nI should consider the balance between financial responsibility and respecting a partner's emotional needs. The author's stance is about saving money, but the fianc\u00e9's desire for privacy and comfort is valid. The author's decision to make the fianc\u00e9 pay could be seen as selfish if it's causing unnecessary stress during the holidays. However, the author's financial situation (saving for a house) is also a valid point.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have effectively communicated their financial priorities to the fianc\u00e9, leading to misunderstandings. The fianc\u00e9 might feel unheard if the author is rigid in their stance without considering her feelings. The author's mention of the fianc\u00e9's parents paying for the wedding might be a point of contention, but it's different from the hotel situation.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about the mother's feelings shows that they value family time, but the fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is about her own comfort. It's a conflict between two valid perspectives. The author's response of threatening to let the fianc\u00e9 go to her family might be extreme and hurtful, even if not explicitly stated.\n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting the cost or finding a compromise could be a middle ground. But the author insists the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely, which might not be fair if the hotel is the author's responsibility for the trip. Since the author is the one making the plans (visiting their parents), perhaps they should have more say, but the fianc\u00e9's comfort is also important.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a key factor here. If the author is saving for a house, they might have a legitimate reason to avoid extra expenses. However, prioritizing financial goals over the partner's emotional needs during a holiday can strain the relationship. It's a balance between practicality and empathy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not offering a compromise and for making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely, which could be seen as selfish. However, their financial situation adds context. But since the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable (privacy during a holiday), the author's rigid stance might be the issue. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
