We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong. The situation is about planning Christmas: the author wants to stay with their parents, but the fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, so the fianc\u00e9 has to pay herself. They had a big fight about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is prioritizing saving money for a house and staying with family they don't see often. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is stressed about family dynamics. The author argues it's only two nights, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's important enough to pay for a hotel. \n\nThe author says they've done this before at the parents' house, so maybe this is a new request. The fianc\u00e9 is paying for the hotel herself, so she's taking initiative. But the author is frustrated because the fianc\u00e9 is upset about the author not paying, even though the author is contributing elsewhere (like the house). \n\nIs it fair for the author to expect the fianc\u00e9 to stay with his parents? It's a holiday, and privacy is a valid concern. The author's stance is about financial responsibility, but maybe he's being inflexible. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's request isn't unreasonable. The author's ultimatum (\"you pay, I go with you\") could be seen as a way to avoid compromise. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a lavish wedding, which the author can't afford. The author is saving for a house, so he's in a different financial position. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to save, but the way he's handling it might be. Forcing the fianc\u00e9 to either go with his family's plan or pay could be selfish. \n\nThe key points: the author's priorities (saving, family time) vs. the fianc\u00e9's needs (privacy, comfort). The author's refusal to compromise might be the issue here. Even if the author's reasoning is valid, the approach taken could be hurtful. The fianc\u00e9 is making a reasonable request, and the author's response (making her pay or not going) is a harsh ultimatum. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not making an effort to meet her halfway. Even if he has valid reasons for saving money, the way he's enforcing it without considering her feelings is problematic. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
