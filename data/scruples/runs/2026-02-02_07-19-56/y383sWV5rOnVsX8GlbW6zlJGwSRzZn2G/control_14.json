We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because she doesn't want to stay with his parents during Christmas.\n\nFirst, the context: They've stayed with his parents before. This year, the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights due to privacy issues. The author refuses to pay, insisting she covers the cost if she wants that. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels abandoned, and argues about the wedding costs, though she's not actually paying for it. His parents are already hurt, and the author is concerned about the family dynamics and finances.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's reasoning is that staying with parents is the norm, and since she's the one not wanting to, she should pay. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about the cost and feels her needs aren't being considered. The author mentions the wedding is being paid for by her parents, but he's saving for a house. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Well, he's trying to save money and avoid his parents' feelings. But maybe he's not considering her need for privacy. On the other hand, two nights might be a small expense for a hotel. However, if she's the one insisting on it, perhaps it's fair for her to pay. But then again, if it's a matter of privacy and the family is smothering, maybe it's a valid concern. \n\nThe author's stance is that if she wants the hotel, she should pay. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels the author isn't supporting her. But the author is trying to balance his family's feelings and finances. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a tight spot. The author isn't wrong for wanting to save money and avoid his parents' hurt feelings, but maybe he's not being considerate of her need for space. However, since she's the one changing the plans, it's reasonable to expect her to cover the cost. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the fianc\u00e9 is also stressed about the wedding costs. But the author clarifies that she isn't actually paying for it, so maybe her argument is a red herring. That could be a point against her. \n\nOverall, the author has valid reasons, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction might be overblown. But the author could have handled it better, maybe by compromising or discussing it more. However, the core issue is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not the one changing the arrangement and is willing to go to the hotel if she pays, it's a bit of a gray area. I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. So answer B.\n"
