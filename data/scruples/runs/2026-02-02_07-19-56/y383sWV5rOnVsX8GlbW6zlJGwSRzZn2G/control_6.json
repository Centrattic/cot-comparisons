We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel instead of with their parents for Christmas, and the author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author and fianc\u00e9 have stayed with the parents before, but this time the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to. The problem is the author is refusing to pay for the hotel. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels the author is being selfish, and is mad about the cost. The author is also considering splitting up with her by telling her to go to her own family, but hasn't done it yet.\n\nSo, the key points here are about compromise, financial responsibility, and family dynamics. The author is arguing that two nights isn't too long and that staying with parents is what they've done before. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about privacy and the stress of dealing with the author's mother and other family members. The author is also frustrated because the fianc\u00e9's family is paying for an expensive wedding that they can't afford, while the author is trying to save for a house.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's position is that they've done this before, it's only two nights, and they don't want to spend extra money. The fianc\u00e9's position is that she needs privacy, the family dynamics are stressful, and she feels the author isn't considering her needs. The author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay the hotel, which might be seen as unfair, especially if they're supposed to be a team. However, the author is also dealing with their mother's feelings and family expectations, which adds complexity.\n\nThe author mentions that the fianc\u00e9's family is paying for the wedding, but the author is saving for a house. That could be a point where the author feels financial pressure, but maybe the hotel is a small expense compared to the wedding. The author's stance is that the fianc\u00e9 should accept staying with the parents, but the fianc\u00e9 is requesting a different option for her well-being. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the author is refusing to budge on the hotel cost because of financial reasons, but the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a reasonable request (privacy), maybe the author is being too rigid. However, the author is also trying to manage their finances responsibly. There's a balance between personal comfort and financial priorities. \n\nBut the author's threat to tell the fianc\u00e9 to go to her family is a red flag. That's a harsh reaction and could be seen as selfish. However, the author is under stress from both the fianc\u00e9's demands and family expectations. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel or if they're justified in their position. \n\nConsidering that the author is not in the wrong for wanting to avoid unnecessary expenses, but perhaps could have approached the situation with more empathy. However, making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself might not be fair if it's a shared responsibility in the relationship. On the other hand, if the author is saving money for a house and the hotel is an expense they can avoid, it's understandable. \n\nIn the end, the author is not necessarily in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. The fianc\u00e9's need for privacy is valid, but the author is also within their rights to manage their finances. The main issue is the lack of compromise. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in how they handle the situation.\n"
