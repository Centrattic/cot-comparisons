We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of at his parents' house for Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, so the fianc\u00e9 has to pay herself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author thinks staying at his parents' is fine, even though there's no privacy and other family members. He's concerned about the cost and his mom's feelings. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about privacy and feels the author is being selfish. The author is trying to save money for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for an expensive wedding.\n\nSo, the main issue is about financial responsibility and personal preferences. The author is making his fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel, which he might see as fair since he's saving for a house. But the fianc\u00e9 feels she's being made to sacrifice her comfort (privacy) for his parents' plans and the wedding. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners should consider each other's needs. The author is prioritizing his savings and family traditions, but his fianc\u00e9's comfort is also important. The fact that she's staying with his parents in the first place is part of the plan they agreed on. By forcing her to pay for the hotel, he's making her choose between her comfort or her own expenses. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, which might add to her feeling that she's not being supported. The author's response to the fight seems harsh by suggesting she go to her family, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to his financial priorities. But the problem is that he's not finding a compromise. Maybe a middle ground, like splitting the hotel cost or finding a cheaper option, could have worked. Instead, he's rigid, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong, but he could have handled it better. However, the answer depends on whether the fianc\u00e9's needs were considered. Since the author is making her pay for her own preference (privacy) even though they were planning to stay with his parents, he might be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong), but I need to check if the reasoning holds.\n"
