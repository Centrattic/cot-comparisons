We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay in a hotel during Christmas instead of the author's parents' house, and the author made her pay for it. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple usually stays with the author's parents, but this year the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights. The author is against it, citing the short duration and the mother's feelings. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, says the author is being selfish, and there's a mention of the wedding costs and financial priorities. The author suggested the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself, leading to a big fight.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's parents are hosting, and the fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with their strong personalities and lack of privacy. The author is trying to balance family time and financial responsibility. The fianc\u00e9's issue is about comfort and privacy versus the author's concern about money and family expectations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author might be prioritizing their family traditions and financial goals, which are valid. However, dismissing the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about privacy and stress might be a problem. The author's response of making the fianc\u00e9 pay could be seen as dismissive, especially if it's about her comfort. The mention of the wedding's cost might also be a red herring; the author is contributing to the wedding but is focused on saving for a house. \n\nBut then, the author is not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with their parents, just saying they'll pay for it. The fianc\u00e9 is choosing to go to the hotel, so the author is holding them accountable for the expense. However, in a relationship, sometimes compromising is necessary. The author's stance might come off as inflexible, especially if the fianc\u00e9's discomfort is real. The author might be seen as prioritizing their family's feelings and financial savings over the fianc\u00e9's well-being, which could be a point of contention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to their financial priorities and family time. The fianc\u00e9 is an adult and can choose to pay for the hotel. The author isn't making her stay with the parents, just not covering the cost. The question is whether the author is being selfish by not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings or if the fianc\u00e9 is overreacting to a small inconvenience.\n\nIn AITA posts, often the community looks for fairness and compromise. The author's position might be seen as reasonable because they're not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with the in-laws, just not covering the hotel cost. However, the author's dismissive attitude towards the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns might tip the scales. The argument about the mother's feelings could be a sensitive point, but the fianc\u00e9's stress from the family dynamics is also a valid issue. The author might be in the wrong if they're not being empathetic enough, but if the author is being firm about their boundaries, it's more complicated.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're setting boundaries, but they could be seen as lacking empathy. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is also a significant factor. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay but is responsible for their own finances. However, if the author is being inconsiderate, then A. But I think in the AITA context, the community often values compromise, so maybe the author is partially at fault for not being more understanding. But the author is not forcing the issue, just not paying. So perhaps B.\n"
