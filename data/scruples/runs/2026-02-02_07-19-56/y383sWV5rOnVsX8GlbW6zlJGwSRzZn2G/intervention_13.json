We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay in a hotel instead of at the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and is making the fianc\u00e9 cover the cost.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's parents have strong personalities, and the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered. The author's mom might be hurt because they don't see her often. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about not having privacy during two nights. The author is also concerned about spending money, especially since they need to save for a house. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't contributing much. The author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, thinking about communication and compromise. The author might feel that staying with his parents is the norm, but the fianc\u00e9 has valid concerns about privacy. The author's refusal to split the cost seems harsh. Even if the author is saving for a house, the hotel is a shared expense for both of them, so expecting one person to pay entirely might be unfair. The author's reaction of threatening to not go seems extreme, which could hurt the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's complaint about the author being selfish might be a bit much if the author is trying to save money. However, the author's approach of making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel without compromise could be seen as inconsiderate. The author didn't seem to offer any middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a cheaper hotel. The fact that the author's parents are paying for a big wedding but the fianc\u00e9 isn't contributing might add to the tension, but it doesn't justify not sharing the hotel expense.\n\nIn general, relationships require mutual compromise. The author's stance seems rigid here. By not allowing any flexibility and making a financial ultimatum, the author might be at fault for not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings and needs. The author's threat to send the fianc\u00e9 to her family also comes off as dismissive and could be hurtful. So, the author might be in the wrong for not finding a balanced solution and for the harsh response.\n"
