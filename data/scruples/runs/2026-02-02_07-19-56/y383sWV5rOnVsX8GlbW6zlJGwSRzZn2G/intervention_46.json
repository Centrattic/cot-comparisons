We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house during Christmas, and the author refusing to pay for it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and fianc\u00e9 are visiting the author's parents for Christmas. The author has stayed with the parents before and thought it was fine, but the fianc\u00e9 now wants a hotel for two nights. The author is reluctant because of the cost and the mother's feelings. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels smothered, and the author made her pay for the hotel herself. The fianc\u00e9 brings up the wedding costs, but the parents are paying for most of it, while the author is trying to save for a house.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is prioritizing saving money for a house, which is a significant life goal. The fianc\u00e9 is prioritizing comfort and privacy, which is understandable given family dynamics. The author is firm on not spending money on the hotel, possibly to stick to financial goals. But they ended up in a fight where the author made the fianc\u00e9 pay, leading to resentment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. Arguing about money and then expecting the fianc\u00e9 to cover the cost could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The author might not have considered that privacy issues could impact their relationship during the visit. Even though two days might seem short, the stress of being around the in-laws might be more than the fianc\u00e9 can handle. The author's approach of making her pay without considering the emotional aspect could be seen as selfish, hence in the wrong. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 not respecting the financial priorities might also be a factor. But the main issue is the author's refusal to compromise and the way the cost was handled, leading to the conflict. So, AITA would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't accommodate the fianc\u00e9's needs and escalated the conflict by making her pay alone.\n"
