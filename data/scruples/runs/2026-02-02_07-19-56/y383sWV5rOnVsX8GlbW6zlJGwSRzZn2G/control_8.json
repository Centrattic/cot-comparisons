We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong for making his fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel instead of staying with his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9 are planning to visit his parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy because there are other guests, and the author refuses to pay for it. The author is frustrated because it's only two nights and his mother might be hurt. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned, and argues about the wedding costs. The author's stance is that if she wants the hotel, she should pay for it, and they're fighting over it.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is wrong. Key points: the author is trying to save money for a house, the parents are paying for the wedding, so the fianc\u00e9 isn't actually paying much. The author is prioritizing saving over spending on a hotel. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy, which is a valid concern, but the author is not willing to pay for it. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's only two nights. But maybe privacy is a legitimate need. The author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay, which could be seen as him not compromising. Also, the author's parents might be hurt, but the author's fianc\u00e9's feelings are also a factor. \n\nIs the author being selfish? He's not budging and making her pay, but he's also trying to save for a house, which is a long-term goal. The fianc\u00e9's argument about the wedding might not be valid since her parents are covering it. The author's position is that he's not willing to spend money on something he doesn't want to do (hotel) instead of staying with parents. \n\nBut making the fianc\u00e9 pay for her preference might be a point against him. Maybe he should be more flexible. However, he's not forcing her to stay with his parents; he's just saying he won't pay for the hotel. So if she wants to go to the hotel, she has to pay. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the key is whether the author's actions are unreasonable. If he's standing his ground because of financial priorities, but not making her stay with his parents, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's making her pay for her own choice, that could be seen as a bit harsh. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's right because he's not spending his money on a choice she's making. Privacy is important, but so is respecting the partner's wishes. The author's parents might be hurt, but the fianc\u00e9's needs are also valid. \n\nI think the author's position is reasonable because he's not forcing her to stay with his parents, just not paying for her choice. However, the fact that he's making her foot the bill could be seen as not compromising. But since he's not paying for her choice, and she wants to do it, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer might be B (No). But I'm a bit conflicted. The author is standing up for his financial priorities and not budging, but he's not making her stay with his parents. So maybe B is correct.\n"
