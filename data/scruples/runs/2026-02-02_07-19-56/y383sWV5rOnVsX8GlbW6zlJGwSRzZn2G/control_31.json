We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel instead of visiting his parents for Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, so he's saying if she wants to go, she has to pay for it herself.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author and his fianc\u00e9 have done this before, staying at his parents' house. This year, the fianc\u00e9 is upset about the lack of privacy because his parents will have other guests. The author is feeling that two nights isn't a big deal and is concerned about saving money for a house. The fianc\u00e9 is angry, feeling abandoned, and brings up the wedding costs, even though her parents are paying for the wedding and he's trying to save. \n\nSo, the core issue is about privacy versus financial responsibility and family traditions. The author is trying to save money, which is a valid reason. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has a legitimate concern about privacy in a house with other guests and a strong personality family. \n\nIs it fair for the author to make her pay for the hotel? Well, if they're a couple, sharing expenses is common, especially for holidays. But the author's reasoning is that he's already saving for a house and can't spend extra on a hotel. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels it's about her needs not being met. The fact that the author's parents are hosting their Christmas and he's expected to prioritize their tradition might play a role here. \n\nHowever, the author is also considering financial prudence. If he's the one paying, maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to save. But by making her pay, is he being unfair? The fianc\u00e9 might feel that since it's their holiday, they should have some time together without his parents. The author's response of letting her go if she wants could be seen as harsh, but maybe it's a boundary he's trying to set. \n\nAnother angle: how often do they visit the author's parents? If it's not very often, maybe the mother's feelings are important. But the fianc\u00e9's comfort is also a factor. There's a balance between family time and couple time. The author is prioritizing saving money over her privacy. But is that selfish? Or is it just being practical? \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument about the wedding might be a red herring, since her parents are covering most of that. The author is not the one paying for the wedding. So maybe the fight is about different priorities. The author is trying to save for a house, which is a big commitment. The fianc\u00e9 is valuing the two-night privacy over that. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author could have tried to find a middle ground, like splitting the hotel cost, or maybe finding a way to have some privacy during their stay. By saying she has to pay entirely, maybe he's being rigid. But if he's not willing to spend money he can't afford, that's his decision. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the hotel is a reasonable request. If the family is smothering and the privacy is a significant issue, then maybe she's not wrong to want a hotel. But if it's just two nights and the author is trying to save, he might not be wrong either. However, the way he handled it by making her pay might be seen as dismissive of her feelings, leading to conflict. \n\nThe question is whether making her pay is the right approach. The author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary about finances, but he might have been more considerate. Since the fianc\u00e9 is choosing a higher cost option, it's reasonable that she would need to cover it. But maybe the author could have offered to split the cost if it's a big deal for her. \n\nThe final answer: the author is not in the wrong (B), because he's standing by his financial decision and the fianc\u00e9 is choosing a more expensive option. However, there's room for better communication and compromise, which might have avoided the fight. But the question is specifically whether he's in the wrong, and since both have valid points, the answer might be B.\n"
