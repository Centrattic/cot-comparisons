We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is the fianc\u00e9 who refuses to stay at the parents' house for Christmas because the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to stay there. The author insists on staying in a hotel and makes the other person pay for it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their fianc\u00e9 are planning to visit the author's parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights instead of staying with the parents. The author argues that two nights isn't that long and doesn't want to spend the money. The fianc\u00e9 gets upset, says the author is being selfish, and the author then offers to go to the hotel only if the fianc\u00e9 pays. The fianc\u00e9 is not actually paying for the wedding; their parents are covering most of it, while the author is saving for a house.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author is being asked to split the hotel cost, but refuses and makes the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, which is expensive. The author is saving money for a house. The fianc\u00e9 feels smothered by the parents' strong personalities, even though it's only two nights.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user who posted the question thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: they're trying to save money for a house, and maybe they don't want to spend on a hotel. They might feel that staying with parents is more economical, even if it's less comfortable. However, they are making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely, which could be seen as unfair if the fianc\u00e9 is already contributing to the wedding through their parents. But the wedding cost is the parents' responsibility, not the fianc\u00e9's directly. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side: they want privacy and are uncomfortable with the parents. They might feel that the author isn't considering their feelings, especially with the mother's hurt feelings involved. The author is being asked to compromise, but instead of finding a middle ground, they're making the fianc\u00e9 pay fully. \n\nIs it fair for the author to insist on the hotel only if the fianc\u00e9 pays? That could be seen as putting the burden on the fianc\u00e9, especially if the fianc\u00e9 can't afford it. But the author is saving money for a house, which is a significant future expense. However, the author could have offered a compromise, like splitting the cost or finding a more affordable hotel. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 is not actually paying for the wedding; it's the fianc\u00e9's parents. So maybe the author's argument about the fianc\u00e9 not contributing financially isn't valid in this case. The author might be conflating the fianc\u00e9's parents' contributions with the fianc\u00e9's own finances. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is being rigid and not showing empathy. The fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable, given the discomfort and lack of privacy. The author's response of making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely could be seen as insensitive, especially since the original plan was to stay with the parents. \n\nSo, the author is not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings and is making a financial demand that might not be fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But also, the fianc\u00e9 should have communicated better and maybe found a middle ground. However, the question is about the author's actions. Insisting on the hotel only if the fianc\u00e9 pays, without compromise, could be seen as selfish. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
