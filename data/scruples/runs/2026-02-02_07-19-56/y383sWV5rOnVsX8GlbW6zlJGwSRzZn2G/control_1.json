We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay in a hotel instead of at the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, making the fianc\u00e9 cover the cost if she wants to stay there. They ended up in a fight, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's side: they're visiting their parents, have done this before, and believe staying at the parents' house is better. They mention that the parents might have other guests, so privacy is an issue, but it's only two nights. The author is concerned about their mother's feelings and the family's strong personalities. They're also trying to save money for a house, which is important for their future. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side: she wants privacy, feels smothered by the family, and is upset that the author isn't paying for the hotel. She mentions the wedding costs, implying the author should contribute more, but actually, her parents are paying for the wedding, which the author is trying to save for their home. The author's stance is that if she wants to stay in a hotel, she should pay for it herself. \n\nNow, considering fairness. The author is setting a boundary about finances, which is reasonable. They're not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with the parents; they\u2019re just not covering the hotel cost. The fianc\u00e9 is choosing her preference and expecting the author to pay, which the author is resisting. The author's argument is about shared responsibility and financial priorities. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's complaint about the author abandoning her on Christmas might be a misunderstanding. The author is willing to stay with her in the hotel but expects her to pay. The author isn't avoiding the holiday; they\u2019re just choosing their parents' house unless the fianc\u00e9 covers the alternative. \n\nThe key points are financial responsibility, respect for each other's preferences, and communication. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to spend money they can't afford, especially for future goals like a house. The fianc\u00e9's frustration is valid if she feels the author isn't considering her comfort, but the author has their own valid reasons. \n\nHowever, the author's final threat to tell her to go with her family is a bit harsh, but maybe that's part of the emotional tension. The main issue is whether the author is being selfish. Since they're setting a boundary and not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with the parents (just not paying for the hotel), it's more about mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong here because they\u2019re making a reasonable request based on their financial situation and priorities.\n"
