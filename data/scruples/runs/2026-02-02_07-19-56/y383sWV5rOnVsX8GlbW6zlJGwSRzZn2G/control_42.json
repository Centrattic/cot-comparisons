We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay at a hotel instead of with his parents during Christmas, and he made his fianc\u00e9e pay for it. They had a fight about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author thinks it's only two nights and wants to stay with his parents. His fianc\u00e9e is upset about the lack of privacy and the author's mom's feelings. The author is trying to save money for a house, while her parents are paying for a big wedding. The author offered to stay with his parents and insisted she pay for the hotel if she wanted to go that route.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. Is it fair for the author to make his fianc\u00e9e pay for the hotel? Well, they're engaged, but not married yet. Typically, in relationships, splitting costs is common, but the author is refusing to pay for the hotel, making her cover it. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, feeling abandoned and that he's being selfish. The author's reasoning is about saving money for a house and not wanting to spend on a hotel for two nights. But his fianc\u00e9e has valid concerns about privacy and stress from his family. \n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e's parents are paying for the wedding, which is a different context. The author is trying to save, but making her pay for the hotel might not be fair, especially if they're a couple. Even if it's two nights, the author is making her choose between his parents or paying for a hotel. That could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the author is dismissing her feelings about privacy and the stress of the family dynamics. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that since the wedding is being paid by her parents, he doesn't need to be considerate financially. But that's a separate issue. The main point here is about the hotel. The author's approach could be seen as not supportive of his fianc\u00e9e's needs. Compromise might be necessary here. The author's stance seems rigid, not allowing for mutual compromise. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the author's actions are causing conflict. Making the fianc\u00e9e pay for the hotel when she wants to avoid his parents could be seen as selfish, even if the author's intention is to save money. Relationships require giving and taking, and the author isn't offering a middle ground here. He's not considering her emotional needs, which are valid. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n\nWait, the author did offer to stay with his parents and only go to the hotel if she pays. That's a key point. He's not forcing her to stay with his parents, but he's not sharing the cost. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but he's not entirely right either. However, in a relationship, expecting the other person to handle the cost of a shared expense might be unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9e is left in a difficult position where she either has to pay out of pocket or stay with his parents. \n\nConsidering AITA standards, the author is in the wrong (A) because he's making her pay for a hotel which is a shared expense, not considering her perspective, and not compromising. Even though his reasoning is about saving money, the way he's handling the situation is causing unnecessary conflict and could be seen as selfish. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about privacy and family stress are valid, and the author isn't addressing them adequately. So the answer is A.\n"
