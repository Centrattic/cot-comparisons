We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author argues that it's only two nights and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about privacy and the author's mother's feelings. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants to go that route. The fianc\u00e9 then gets angry, saying the author is being selfish, especially considering her parents are paying for the wedding.\n\nHmm. I need to consider both sides. The author wants to stay with parents, maybe because of tradition or not wanting to spend money. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy, which is valid. The author is concerned about costs and saving for a house. But by making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself, is the author being unreasonable?\n\nWait, the author is not in the wrong if they set boundaries. It's their money, right? But maybe the author should be more considerate. The fianc\u00e9's request isn't unreasonable because privacy is important. However, the author's stance on not wanting to spend money might be seen as selfish, especially during a holiday. But the fianc\u00e9 is also not contributing to the wedding costs, which adds complexity. The author is trying to save for a house, which is a big life goal. \n\nIs the author wrong for not compromising? Maybe they should have discussed alternatives, like splitting the cost or finding a budget-friendly hotel. By making it an all-or-nothing choice, the author might have caused unnecessary conflict. But then again, the author is within their rights to decline the expense. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unfair. The author's reasoning is about financial responsibility, but the fianc\u00e9 feels unconsidered. The author's mother's feelings are a factor too. The answer might depend on the relationship dynamics and how communication is handled. Since the author is not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with their parents but is offering to go alone if she insists on the hotel, maybe it's a matter of perspective. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on finances and tradition. However, the way they handled the situation could be improved. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not if they could have handled it better. So the answer might be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. The fianc\u00e9's privacy concerns are valid, but the author's financial priorities are too. The author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with their parents; they're just not paying for the hotel. So maybe the author isn't at fault here.\n"
