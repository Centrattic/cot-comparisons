We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation.\n\nSo the situation is about the author and their fianc\u00e9 disagreeing on where to stay during Christmas. The author wants to stay with their parents, which they've done before, but the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel room for more privacy. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, so the fianc\u00e9 is upset and thinks the author is being selfish. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 is not actually paying for the wedding, which is being covered by her parents, while the author is saving money to buy a house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is that staying with their parents is cheaper and they don't want to spend money on a hotel. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and feels smothered by the author's family. The author also mentions that their mother might be hurt because they don't see her often. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a big expense, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset that the author isn't paying for the hotel even though the author's parents are spending money on the wedding. Wait, no\u2014the fianc\u00e9 isn't paying for the wedding; her parents are. The author is the one saving money for a house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset that the author is making her pay for the hotel.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and mutual understanding. The author is prioritizing saving money and not wanting to upset their mother, while the fianc\u00e9 prioritizes privacy and comfort. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she insists on not staying with the parents. \n\nI need to think about fairness in relationships. Both partners should consider each other's needs. The author's financial concerns are valid, especially wanting to save for a house. However, the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy and comfort is also valid. The author's solution of making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel might seem like a way to avoid the cost, but it could be seen as not respecting the fianc\u00e9's needs. The author is using financial responsibility as a justification, but maybe there's a middle ground. \n\nIs the author wrong? They are standing their ground on not wanting to spend money, but maybe not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings enough. The fight seems to be about conflicting priorities. The author's fianc\u00e9 feels that the author is being selfish by not compromising, even though the author is saving money. The author's response of making the fianc\u00e9 pay might be a way to avoid the financial burden but could come across as dismissive of her needs. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a balance. The author could have tried to explain their financial situation more clearly and perhaps found a compromise, like splitting the cost or choosing a cheaper hotel. Instead, the author took a rigid stance, leading to the argument. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being flexible and for making the fianc\u00e9 pay, especially when the decision affects her comfort. The author's fianc\u00e9's request for privacy might be reasonable, and the author's refusal without finding a compromise could be seen as selfish. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
