We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of their parents' house during Christmas, and the author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because they don't want to spend the money. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's reasoning is that it's only two nights and they want to save money for a house. They also mention that the fianc\u00e9 isn't actually paying for the wedding, her parents are, which is a big expense. The author feels that the hotel is unnecessary given the short stay and their financial goals.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is uncomfortable with the author's parents, especially since others are coming. The author's mom might be hurt because they don't see each other often. The fianc\u00e9's request for a hotel is about comfort and personal space. The author's response was to make her pay for the hotel, which she found unacceptable, especially when her parents are already spending on the wedding.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are unreasonable. Making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because they don't want to spend the money could be seen as selfish, especially if the request is reasonable. Privacy is a valid concern, and two nights might not be too long, but if the fianc\u00e9 is genuinely uncomfortable, it's a valid choice. The author is prioritizing their financial goals, but maybe not considering the emotional and relational aspects here.\n\nThe author's mom's feelings are also a factor. The author is caught between their parents' expectations and their partner's needs. However, the fianc\u00e9's request is about her own comfort, which is important in a relationship. The fact that the author is willing to separate during the holiday if necessary shows some conflict, but holding the fianc\u00e9 responsible for the hotel cost might be harsh.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 isn't paying for the wedding, her parents are. The author is saving for a house. But in relationships, shared expenses often require compromise. The author's refusal to contribute to the hotel could be seen as not being considerate of their partner's needs, even if the financial aspect is a priority.\n\nSo, the author is making a financial decision but not considering the emotional impact on their partner. Relationships require compromise, and perhaps the author is not being flexible here. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is reasonable, and the author's response of making her pay might be inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
