We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of with the author's parents during Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants to go that route.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and fianc\u00e9 have stayed with the parents before, and the fianc\u00e9 is now uncomfortable due to lack of privacy. The author feels staying with parents is more economical, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset. The author is also under financial stress because the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for an expensive wedding, while the author wants to save for a house.\n\nThe author's reasoning: two nights isn't long, and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9 feels smothered, especially with other family members. The author is prioritizing saving money over the fianc\u00e9's comfort. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and feels the author is being selfish.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both partners should consider each other's needs. The author is saving money, which is understandable, but the fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid. The author's response\u2014making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel\u2014might be seen as a way to enforce their own preference without considering the fianc\u00e9's discomfort. Compromise could involve splitting the cost or finding a middle ground, like a cheaper hotel or staying with the author's parents but arranging some privacy.\n\nHowever, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing financial stability, especially for a future home. But by not offering to split the cost and instead making the fianc\u00e9 pay in full, it could be seen as dismissive. The fianc\u00e9's feelings about being smothered are important, and the author might be underestimating the emotional impact of the situation.\n\nAlso, the context of the fianc\u00e9's parents paying for the wedding adds to the tension. The author is trying to balance their own financial goals against the fianc\u00e9's immediate comfort. However, the author's refusal to compromise might be the issue here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the general advice is about communication and compromise. The author could have discussed the financial concerns and perhaps found a solution that both can agree on, rather than making the fianc\u00e9 choose between her comfort and the author's financial priorities. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being more flexible and understanding.\n"
