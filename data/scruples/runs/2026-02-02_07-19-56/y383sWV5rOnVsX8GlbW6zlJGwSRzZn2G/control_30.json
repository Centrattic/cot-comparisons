We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their fianc\u00e9. The scenario is about whether the author should make their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because she doesn't want to stay with his parents during Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author and fianc\u00e9 usually stay at his parents' house, but this year the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel. The author thinks two nights isn't long enough for privacy issues. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about the parents' strong personalities and lack of privacy. The author isn't willing to pay for the hotel, so he says she has to cover the cost. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, accusing him of acting like a child and abandoning her, and bringing up the wedding costs where her parents are paying for it, while the author is trying to save for a house.\n\nNow, determining fault. The author's reasoning is that staying with parents is traditional, and he doesn't want to spend money on a hotel. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is about privacy and comfort. Both have valid points. The author is trying to save for a house, which is important for their future. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about the two days with his family, which might not be ideal for her. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting her to pay if she insists on the hotel? Well, he's not forcing her to stay with his parents; he's saying if she wants a hotel, she pays. That might be fair, but maybe he's being inflexible. On the other hand, she's asking to spend extra money on a hotel when they have to fly out. The author's point about his mother's feelings is another layer\u2014maybe the fianc\u00e9 isn't considering the impact on his family's feelings. \n\nThere's also the mention of the wedding finances. The fianc\u00e9 brings up that her parents are paying for the wedding, implying the author should cover other expenses. But the author is saving for a house. That might be a separate issue, but it could be affecting their current dispute. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's standing his ground about not wanting to spend on a hotel, which is his right. However, the way the conflict escalated might be his fault. By being rigid and not compromising, he's causing tension. The key is whether he's being unreasonable in expecting her to pay for the hotel if she wants it. \n\nAlternatively, the fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting by bringing up the wedding costs. The author's stance is about splitting costs based on preference. It's a common issue in relationships where both partners have different priorities. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks at whether both parties have valid points. Here, both have valid concerns. The author isn't forcing her to stay with his parents, but he's not budging on the cost. The fianc\u00e9's privacy concerns are valid, but maybe she's not considering the author's financial goals. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. The author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for compromise. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he's not forcing her to stay with his parents, maybe the answer is B (No). The key is that he's not obligated to pay for the hotel if she doesn't want to stay with his parents, so it's fair for him to expect her to cover the cost if she wants the hotel. However, his rigid stance might be problematic, but in terms of being in the wrong, it's more of a mutual issue. Since the question is about AITA, the author might not be the asshole here.\n"
