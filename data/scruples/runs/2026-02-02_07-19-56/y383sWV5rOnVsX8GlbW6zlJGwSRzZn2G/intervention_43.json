We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement over staying with the author's parents for Christmas versus getting a hotel room. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, insisting on staying with his parents. His fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy because there are other guests, and he's not budging unless she pays. The author argues it's only two nights and he doesn't want to spend money, while she feels he's being selfish and not considering her comfort.\n\nI should consider the points raised. The author mentions his mother's feelings will be hurt because he's not staying with them. He also mentions financial concerns, trying to save for a house. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and feels smothered by his family's strong personalities. The author accuses her of wanting a big wedding she's not paying for, which might be a sore point. \n\nIs the author wrong to not compromise? Maybe. Staying with his parents is a tradition and he's concerned about family feelings and finances, but the fianc\u00e9's comfort is also valid. The author's refusal to share the expense unless she pays entirely might be seen as inflexible. He's essentially making her choose between her comfort and the author's financial priorities. \n\nFinancial responsibility is important, but relationships require compromise. The author's stance could come across as dismissive of her needs. Also, the fact that she's the one with parents paying for the wedding might add to her frustration, feeling that her contributions aren't valued. \n\nIn arguments about family traditions versus personal comfort, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. However, the author's approach seems rigid. A more balanced solution, like splitting the hotel cost or finding a middle ground, might have been better. By making her pay the entire bill, he's not showing willingness to meet her halfway, which could be why she feels wronged. So, the author might be in the wrong here for not compromising and prioritizing his own preferences over her feelings.\n"
