We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the fianc\u00e9 should pay for a hotel instead of staying with the author's parents for Christmas. The author isn't willing to spend the money on a hotel, so he's making the fianc\u00e9 pay herself if she wants to stay there. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and thinks he's acting selfishly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that staying at the parents' house is cheaper, and they've done it before. He mentions that the parents are getting hurt feelings because they don't see him much, and he wants to spend time with them. Also, he's trying to save money for a house. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels uncomfortable with the lack of privacy and wants a hotel for two nights. She's upset because she feels abandoned and that the author isn't considering her needs. Plus, she's pointing out that her parents are paying for the wedding, which is expensive, so she thinks the author should contribute more.\n\nNow, is the author wrong for expecting his fianc\u00e9 to pay for the hotel if she wants to stay there? Well, he's not forcing her to stay with his parents; he's giving her a choice. If she wants privacy, she can pay for the hotel herself. That seems fair. But maybe the problem is that he's not considering her feelings and the stress of dealing with his family. The author is prioritizing his parents' feelings and financial goals (saving for a house), while the fianc\u00e9 is prioritizing her comfort and privacy. \n\nAnother angle: the author's parents have a strong personality, and the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered. Even if it's only two nights, privacy is important. The author is making a financial decision but not taking into account her emotional needs. However, the author is also trying to manage his finances responsibly, and it's reasonable to expect that if someone wants a more expensive option, they pay for it. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction might be over the top, but her feelings are valid. The author could have been more empathetic and discussed compromises, like maybe staying one night at the hotel and one at the parents' house. Or splitting the cost. Instead, he's taking a hard line, which could be seen as selfish because he's prioritizing his parents' feelings and his financial goals over her comfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong for wanting to balance his priorities. The fianc\u00e9 is also not paying for anything herself; her parents are covering the wedding costs. But that's a different issue. The key here is whether making her pay for the hotel is unreasonable. If the author is okay with staying with his parents, then it's his choice. However, by not offering a middle ground, he might be in the wrong because he's not showing flexibility for her needs. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and is being rigid. But there's also a financial argument. However, since it's about their relationship and comfort, empathy is important. So, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A), but maybe not entirely. Wait, but the question is binary: A for yes, B for no. So if the author is in the wrong, answer A. If not, B. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B. Because he's not wrong for expecting her to pay if she wants the hotel. He's making a choice based on his priorities. The fianc\u00e9's issue is that she feels he's being selfish, but he's not forcing her to stay with his parents. He's saying if you want the hotel, you pay. That's fair. The problem is their communication and maybe the author not understanding why privacy matters. But in terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a reasonable choice. So answer B.\n"
