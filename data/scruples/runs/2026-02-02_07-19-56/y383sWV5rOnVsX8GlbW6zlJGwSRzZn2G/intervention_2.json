We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong after making their fianc\u00e9 pay for a hotel because the fianc\u00e9 didn't want to stay with the author's parents during Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is planning to visit their parents, which they've done before. This time, the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights. The author refuses to pay, so the fianc\u00e9 has to cover the cost. The author's reasoning is that it's only two nights and they're already worried about their mother's feelings. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling smothered by the family and accused the author of being selfish.\n\nThe author mentions that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding, while the author is trying to save for a house. That seems like a financial tension. The author is not in the wrong if they are making a decision based on their own financial priorities. However, the way the author handled the situation might be questionable. Telling the fianc\u00e9 she has to pay for the hotel and threatening to split up could be seen as harsh, especially during the holidays. The author might be being selfish by not considering their partner's feelings about the family dynamics. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting to two nights without a strong reason. \n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author didn't seem to acknowledge the fianc\u00e9's discomfort with the parents, even if it's only two nights. Marriage involves making compromises, and by not finding a middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a nearby hotel that's cheaper, the author might be at fault. Also, the author's comment about the wedding costs could be a red flag, suggesting they're using financial issues as leverage in the argument. That's not healthy in a relationship. So while the author has valid concerns about finances, their approach was probably wrong. They should have discussed it more respectfully and found a solution that respects both their needs.\n"
