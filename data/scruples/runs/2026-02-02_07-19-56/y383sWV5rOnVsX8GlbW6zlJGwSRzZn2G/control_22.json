We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself because she doesn't want to stay with his parents during Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple usually stays at the author's parents' house when they visit. This year, the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel instead because of privacy issues. The author is resistant, saying the hotel costs money and they've only done it for two nights. The fianc\u00e9 got upset, called him selfish, and mentioned the wedding expenses. The author is considering cutting things off but is hesitant because of potential backlash.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy versus family tradition, financial responsibility, and communication. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a significant life goal. The fianc\u00e9 is paying for most of the wedding, which the author acknowledges is a big expense. However, the author is asking for a small financial compromise here\u2014staying at the parents' house instead of a hotel. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel. From a traditional standpoint, maybe the author expects the fianc\u00e9 to compromise since they're part of the family now. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is within her rights to want privacy, and the author's insistence on her paying for the hotel could be seen as passive-aggressive, especially since the main issue is about staying with his parents. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the hotel is an unnecessary expense for just two nights. But the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered by the family and the author's mother is hurt. The author is caught between his family's expectations and his fianc\u00e9's comfort. \n\nFinancially, the author is saving money, which is important for their future. However, making the fianc\u00e9 pay for her own stay to avoid family time might come off as selfish, especially if the main conflict is about the stay itself rather than the cost. The argument about the wedding might be a red herring\u2014her parents are paying for the wedding, so the author's own contribution is separate. \n\nThe author's response to the fianc\u00e9's request was to say she has to pay for the hotel if she wants to go there. That's a valid approach to compromise, but the way it's presented could be the issue. The fianc\u00e9 might feel it's her being forced to choose between her comfort and the author's savings. Also, the author's consideration of telling her to go to her family instead might seem like a harsh ultimatum, which could be seen as the author being inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's position is understandable for saving money, but the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy is also valid. The author could have offered alternatives, like splitting the cost or finding a middle ground. By making it a \"you pay entirely\" situation, the author might be seen as not valuing the fianc\u00e9's feelings. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the main issue is financial, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the problem is the lack of privacy and the author isn't addressing that, just pushing for cost-saving, then maybe the author is not considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective enough. \n\nThe answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to manage finances and have a valid reason to want to save. However, the situation might require better communication or compromise. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the financial aspect is a personal choice, the answer would be B (No).\n"
