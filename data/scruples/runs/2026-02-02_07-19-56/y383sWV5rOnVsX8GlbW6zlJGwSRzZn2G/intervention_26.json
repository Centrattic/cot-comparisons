We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author and their fianc\u00e9 planning to visit his parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel instead of with the parents, citing a lack of privacy. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, so the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that staying with the parents is more cost-effective and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about privacy and not wanting to feel smothered. The author is also dealing with his mother's potential hurt feelings because they don't visit often. He's trying to save money for a house, which is a common financial priority.\n\nThe key points here are communication, compromise, and mutual respect. The author is taking a firm stance on not wanting to pay for the hotel, which could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's feelings about privacy. However, the fianc\u00e9 is also being asked to stay with a family she finds overwhelming, which is a valid concern. The author mentions that the hotel is for two nights, which is a short time, but privacy issues might still be significant in that duration.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author is saving money, and the fianc\u00e9's family is paying for the wedding. The author's request for the fianc\u00e9 to pay for the hotel could be seen as fair since they have the means (as her family is handling the wedding costs). However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is not considering her emotional needs, which are important for a healthy relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are selfish. The author is standing his ground on the financial decision, possibly not acknowledging the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is emotional, which is understandable given the situation. The author's threat to only see her after Christmas is a strong move, which might be seen as harsh, but it's a response to a conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because financial planning is important. However, the way he handled the situation could be improved. Not being flexible on the hotel request without understanding the fianc\u00e9's perspective might make him partially at fault. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid, and the author could have tried to find a middle ground, like splitting the cost or negotiating the duration of the stay.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong (B), but there's room for improvement in communication and compromise. However, if the fianc\u00e9's privacy needs are significant and the author is unwilling to accommodate them at all, that could tip the scales. But given the context, the author's stance on finances is reasonable, so maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
