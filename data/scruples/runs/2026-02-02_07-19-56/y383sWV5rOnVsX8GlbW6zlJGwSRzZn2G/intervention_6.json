We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house during Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel and makes the fianc\u00e9 pay herself if she wants to stay there. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 complains about no privacy because there are other guests. The author's side is that it's only two nights and they've done it before. But the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered. The author is also worried about their mother's feelings because they don't see them often. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't afford to spend money on a hotel and wants to save for a house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the author is being selfish and abandoning her on Christmas. The author is considering telling the fianc\u00e9 to go with her family instead. \n\nNow, considering both sides. The author is trying to save money for a house, which is a long-term goal, but Christmas is a holiday that's supposed to be spent with family. The fianc\u00e9 wants more privacy and comfort, which is understandable. The author is not allowing the hotel if they have to pay for it, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to pay herself because she's already spending on the wedding. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting the fianc\u00e9 to pay if she wants the hotel? Maybe. It's a compromise issue. The author is prioritizing their parents' feelings and their savings, but maybe not considering the fianc\u00e9's comfort. Also, the fianc\u00e9's desire for privacy might be valid, especially if the previous experience wasn't pleasant. \n\nBut the author is in a position of expecting the fianc\u00e9 to either stay with the parents or pay for the hotel. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author isn't being considerate of her needs. The author's response of making the fianc\u00e9 pay could be seen as pushing back too hard, leading to the fight. \n\nSo maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not meeting the fianc\u00e9 halfway. They could have suggested a cheaper hotel or found a middle ground instead of an all-or-nothing approach. The author's stance on not spending money is valid, but the way they handled it might be too rigid. \n\nAlternatively, the author has a right to set boundaries about spending money, especially for future goals like a house. But the fianc\u00e9 is also in a relationship where both partners' needs should be considered. It's a bit of a balance. \n\nHmm. I think the author is partially wrong because they didn't offer a compromise. They could have found a more affordable hotel that both could agree on or discussed the budget more. Making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely might seem unfair, especially if the author is the one who will be staying with the parents and not getting the privacy benefit. \n\nSo the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
