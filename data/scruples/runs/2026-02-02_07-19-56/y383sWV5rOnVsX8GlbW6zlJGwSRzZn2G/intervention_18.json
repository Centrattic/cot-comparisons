We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the author's fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel during their Christmas visit to his parents instead of staying at the parents' house. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, so the fianc\u00e9 has to pay herself if she wants that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is that it's only two nights, and they've stayed at the parents' house before. He's also worried about his mother's feelings and the strong personalities in the family causing stress. But the fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with the lack of privacy and feels smothered. That's a valid concern. People have different needs for personal space, especially during holidays which can be overwhelming.\n\nThen there's the money aspect. The author is trying to save to buy a house, so he's not willing to spend on a hotel. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because her parents are paying for most of the wedding, implying she feels the author isn't contributing enough. But the author is making it clear that he's contributing to their future by saving. However, he's putting the burden of the hotel cost on her if she wants it, which might be seen as unfair because he's the one who controls the finances in the relationship. \n\nThe author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants it, but she's arguing about the costs. Maybe the author is being rigid here. Even if he doesn't want to pay, insisting that she must pay without compromise might be seen as selfish. The fact that their family dynamics are causing stress for the fianc\u00e9 is a legitimate reason to consider her needs. Two nights isn't long, but if the environment is stressful, maybe the hotel is a reasonable request. \n\nThe author is also not showing much empathy towards her discomfort. Instead of finding a middle ground, he's taking a hard stance, leading to a fight. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, while maybe over-the-top, is a response to feeling neglected. The author's suggestion to have her go to her own family is a bit harsh and could be seen as dismissive. \n\nI think the key points are about compromise and empathy. The author is being rigid in his position without considering that the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy is valid. Also, the financial argument might not be the main issue here. The author is prioritizing his savings and his parents' feelings over his fianc\u00e9's comfort. While saving for a house is important, relationships also require flexibility and understanding. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not being supportive of his fianc\u00e9's needs and is making her pay for her comfort, which could set a precedent for future conflicts. The answer would be A (in the wrong) because he's not compromising and is putting the financial burden on her without considering her feelings.\n"
