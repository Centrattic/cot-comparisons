We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting to stay with the author's parents for Christmas and instead wants a hotel. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants that.\n\nFirst, the main points: They\u2019ve stayed with the parents before, but this time the fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to. The author is okay with staying at the parents' but doesn't want to pay for a hotel. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and thinks the author is being selfish. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for most of the wedding, and the author is saving for a house. The conflict is about who should pay for the hotel.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the author is trying to be frugal. They want to save money for a house, which is a big life goal. The fianc\u00e9 is asking for a hotel, which is a personal preference for privacy. The author is willing to stay with the parents but not pay for the hotel. The fianc\u00e9 wants the author to pay, but the author is refusing. \n\nThe author is not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with the parents; they are saying if she wants a hotel, she pays. The author is being honest about their financial priorities. The fianc\u00e9 might feel this is unfair, but the author isn't obligated to pay for her preference. However, maybe the author could have been more considerate in the way they presented their stance. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author is within their rights to decide how to spend their money. The fianc\u00e9's complaint is about the author's refusal, but the author isn't doing anything unethical. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any other angle. The author is also considering their parents' feelings, but that's their own consideration. The fianc\u00e9's issue is about the cost. The author isn't wrong for wanting to save money for a house. So yes, answer B.\n"
