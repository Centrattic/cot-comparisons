We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to stay in a hotel instead of at the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel and makes the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants to go that route.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author thinks staying with parents is fine, especially since it's only two nights, and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with the lack of privacy and the family dynamics, so she wants a hotel. The author is also worried about his mom's feelings and the family's strong personalities making her feel smothered. \n\nThe author is concerned about money, especially since the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for an expensive wedding, while the author is trying to save for a house. The fianc\u00e9 gets upset and accuses the author of being selfish. The author is now questioning if he's wrong for not paying for the hotel.\n\nSo, is it fair for the author to make the fianc\u00e9 pay? Well, the fianc\u00e9 isn't paying for anything else, but in this case, the author is setting a boundary about money. The author might be in the right because he's trying to save money for a house, and it's reasonable to expect that shared expenses be split unless agreed otherwise. However, maybe the author could have been more considerate of the fianc\u00e9's comfort. But she's the one who initially asked for the hotel, so the responsibility could be on her to cover the cost if it's her preference. \n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding doesn't directly relate to this situation, but it does add to the financial stress. The author is trying to prioritize their future home, which is a significant investment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's parents might be hurt if they're not hosting. But the author is also balancing their own needs with his partner's. The key point is that the author is not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with his parents; he's saying if she wants a hotel, she has to pay for it. That seems fair because he's not making her stay somewhere uncomfortable, just not covering the cost. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing by his financial priorities and setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9's discomfort is valid, but she made the choice to prefer a hotel. Asking her to cover that cost if it's her preference isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
