We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself during Christmas. The author wants to stay with their parents, while the fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel due to privacy concerns. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that staying with the parents is the norm, and they're saving money for a house. The fianc\u00e9 feels smothered and wants privacy. The author suggests the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel, which she resists, bringing up the wedding costs. The author's parents might be hurt, but the fianc\u00e9's feelings are also valid.\n\nIs the author being selfish? They\u2019re not willing to compromise on the hotel cost, which might seem inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9 has a reason to want privacy, even if it's just two nights. The author's stance could be seen as not respecting their partner's needs. However, the author is also trying to save money for a house, which is important for their future. \n\nBut the main issue is splitting the cost. If the author is insistent on not paying and the fianc\u00e9 can't afford it, then the author is being inconsiderate. The argument about the wedding might be a red herring since the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for most of it. The author's refusal to contribute to the hotel could be seen as prioritizing their own financial goals over their partner's comfort. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author's solution of making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely might be seen as unfair, especially if the fianc\u00e9 can't afford it. However, if the author is genuinely unable to spend the money, there's a valid point there. But given the context, the author might not be in the wrong because they're standing by their decision to save for a house, but the approach could be better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong, but the way they handled it could be improved. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The fianc\u00e9's desire for privacy is valid, but the author's financial responsibility is also important. The key is whether the author is wrong for making the fianc\u00e9 pay. If the author is not willing to contribute, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a grey area. So, leaning towards B.\n"
