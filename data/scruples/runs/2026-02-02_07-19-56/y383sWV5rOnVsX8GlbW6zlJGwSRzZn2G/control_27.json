We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself because she doesn't want to stay with his parents on Christmas. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wants to stay with their parents, which they've done before, but the fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel for privacy. The author is refusing to pay for a hotel, so they split the costs by each staying where they prefer. The fianc\u00e9 got upset, feeling abandoned and that the author is being selfish. \n\nThe author mentions that the parents' house isn't the only place they're staying, so maybe there are other guests, making it less private. The fianc\u00e9 is also dealing with the author's mother's feelings, which adds stress. The author argues that it's only two nights and they want to save money for a house. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding, which the author isn't contributing to, while the author is saving for a house.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, wanting to save money is reasonable, especially if they have financial goals like buying a house. The fianc\u00e9's request for a hotel is about personal comfort and privacy, which is also valid. The author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9 to stay with the parents, just making her pay if she wants the hotel. But by not paying at all and making her choose, is that fair? Maybe splitting the cost would be more equitable. Also, the author's response was to make her pay the entire bill, which could be seen as a bit harsh, especially if the issue is about sharing the expense. \n\nThe author might be prioritizing their parents' feelings and financial goals, but the fianc\u00e9's need for privacy and comfort is also important. The key here is communication and compromise. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as not valuing the fianc\u00e9's needs enough. However, the fianc\u00e9 might not be considering the financial priorities of the author. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides could have a point. The author isn't wrong entirely for wanting to save money, but making the fianc\u00e9 pay the entire hotel cost might be seen as not sharing the burden. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have offered a middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a compromise. So, the author might have a valid reason, but their approach could be inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong), but with nuance.\n"
