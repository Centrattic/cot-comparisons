We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of their parents' house for Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, so the fianc\u00e9 is supposed to pay herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's parents have a house, and they've stayed there before. This year, the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights, citing lack of privacy. The author thinks two nights isn't that bad and is upset because their mom might be hurt. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, leading to a fight. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels the author is being selfish, and there's some context about the wedding costs mentioned.\n\nThe author is trying to save money for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are covering the elaborate wedding. The author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay if they want the hotel. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at both sides, the author wants to stay with their parents, which is their family's home, and they're trying to save money. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is willing to pay, but the author won't let them do it without her paying. The author's reasoning is that it's only two nights and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's about their needs and that the author isn't considering their feelings.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships often require compromise. The author is standing their ground on not wanting to pay for the hotel, but maybe they could have negotiated. However, the fianc\u00e9 is also being asked to choose between her comfort and the author's family traditions. The author might be inconsiderate by not finding a middle ground, but the fianc\u00e9's reaction might be over the top. The author's mention of their mother's feelings adds another layer\u2014maybe they're prioritizing family feelings over the fianc\u00e9's comfort.\n\nI think there's some fault on both sides. The author could have been more flexible, but the fianc\u00e9's accusation of selfishness might be harsh. The author isn't entirely wrong for not wanting to spend the money, especially since they need it for a house. However, the lack of compromise might make the author partially at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is not paying, but their reasoning is about financial responsibility and family traditions, maybe they aren't in the wrong entirely. However, not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings enough could be a point. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing their values and financial goals, but there's room for both to find a solution. Alternatively, A if the author is being too rigid. But given that the author is trying to save and the request is for a hotel which is an extra cost, maybe B.\n"
