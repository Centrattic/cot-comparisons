We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel, so the fianc\u00e9 is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's parents' house has been the norm before, and this year the fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with the lack of privacy. The author feels it's only two nights and is worried about the mother's feelings. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered by the family and is upset about the financial aspect, especially since her parents are paying for the wedding. \n\nThe author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because he doesn't want to spend money. The fianc\u00e9 argues that he's being selfish, but the author is trying to save for a house. So the key points are: the fianc\u00e9's comfort versus the author's financial priorities.\n\nI think the author is being a bit rigid. Two nights without privacy can be stressful, especially with a family that's got strong personalities. The author could have tried to compromise, like splitting the cost or finding a middle ground. Making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely might come off as dismissive of her needs. Also, the author's financial situation is important, but relationships also require mutual support and understanding. The argument about the wedding not being her fault doesn't absolve the author from considering her feelings here. So the author might be in the wrong for not being more flexible and for making her pay the entire bill, which could be seen as prioritizing money over her comfort. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't entirely at fault either. They have their own reasons and financial constraints. However, in a relationship, compromise is key. By not budging and instead making his fianc\u00e9 cover the cost, he's not really showing willingness to meet her halfway. That's probably where the mistake is. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
