We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house for Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel and insists on staying with the parents, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel because she doesn't like the lack of privacy. The author thinks it's only two nights and mentions that their family has strong personalities, which might make the fianc\u00e9 feel smothered. But the author is also concerned about their mother's feelings because they don't see the parents often. \n\nThe author is also dealing with financial aspects. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding, which the author can't afford, while the author is trying to save for a house. The author is not asking the fianc\u00e9 to pay for the hotel because the fianc\u00e9 isn't contributing financially to anything else. \n\nThe author's reasoning seems to be about splitting costs and not wanting to spend extra money. But the fianc\u00e9 feels abandoned and accuses the author of being selfish. The author's solution is to let the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants that. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's request is about personal comfort and privacy, which is a valid concern. Two nights can feel long if you're in a stressful environment. The author is prioritizing their family's feelings and financial prudence, but maybe not considering the fianc\u00e9's emotional needs enough. \n\nThe author's argument that the fianc\u00e9 isn't paying for the wedding might not be relevant here. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, but the author is not asking for financial support. The author's stance is about not wanting to spend on a hotel, which could be seen as being inflexible. \n\nMarriage planning involves compromise. The author is making a firm decision without considering a middle ground, like splitting the hotel cost or finding a hotel that's close to the parents' house for some flexibility. The author's response of making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely might be seen as putting the burden solely on her, which could be unfair. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the fianc\u00e9 might actually \"kill\" them if they suggest she go to her family, indicating a fear of conflict. This suggests that the communication isn't healthy, but the core issue is about respecting each other's needs. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both need to compromise. The author's refusal to pay for the hotel without considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author is trying to save money, it's important to acknowledge the fianc\u00e9's discomfort and find a solution that works for both. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're not showing enough flexibility and empathy towards the fianc\u00e9's needs. The situation requires mutual understanding and compromise, which the author isn't offering. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
