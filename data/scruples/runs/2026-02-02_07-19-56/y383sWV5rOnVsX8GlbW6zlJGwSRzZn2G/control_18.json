We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because she doesn't want to stay with the author's parents on Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy, especially since there are other guests and the family has strong personalities. The author feels that it's just two nights and they've done this before, so staying with the parents is the norm. The author is also concerned about the fianc\u00e9's mother's feelings since they don't see her often anymore. Additionally, the author is trying to save money for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding. The author offers to stay with the parents but if the fianc\u00e9 wants the hotel, she has to pay for it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the author is being selfish and not considering her needs.\n\nThe key points here are about compromise and financial responsibility. The author is standing by their decision to not spend money on a hotel for two nights, which they might see as unnecessary. However, the fianc\u00e9 is prioritizing her comfort and privacy, which is a valid concern. The author is also considering their mother's feelings, which adds another layer of family dynamics.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author is being reasonable. The author isn't wrong for wanting to save money and sticking with a previous arrangement, but they might not be considering the fianc\u00e9's valid need for privacy. However, offering to let her pay for the hotel herself if she wants that option is a compromise. The problem arises when the author suggests abandoning the fianc\u00e9, but they haven't actually done that. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author isn't willing to meet halfway, but the author is trying to balance financial responsibility with family expectations.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants the hotel. They are asserting their boundaries regarding finances and previous arrangements. However, the situation shows a need for better communication and finding a middle ground. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is trying to manage finances and has a valid point about the previous arrangement, but they could also work on validating the fianc\u00e9's feelings more.\n"
