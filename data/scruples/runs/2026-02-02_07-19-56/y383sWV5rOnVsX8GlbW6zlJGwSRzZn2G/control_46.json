We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel during Christmas instead of at the author's parents' house. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and is making the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants that. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about this, saying he's abandonment and being selfish. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's parents have a house that they're using, and maybe the family dynamics are a bit intense. The fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable with the lack of privacy and prefers a hotel. The author argues it's only two nights and that the fianc\u00e9 should deal with it. But the fianc\u00e9 is spending a lot on the wedding and feels the author isn't contributing enough, while the author is trying to save for a house.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not spending money on a hotel and wants to stay with his parents. The fianc\u00e9 is paying for the hotel herself if she wants it, but she's upset because she expected the author to cover it. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 isn't actually paying for the wedding herself, but her parents are, and he's trying to save for a house. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the author is standing his ground on the financial decision. If the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel, she's the one who has to pay for it. He's not forcing her to stay with his parents, but he's not willing to spend money on a hotel. The fianc\u00e9 is mad, but maybe that's because of her expectations versus reality. The author's parents are hosting, and he's not making her stay there, but he's not covering the cost either. \n\nI think part of the issue is communication. The author might have thought they were on the same page about staying with the parents. The fianc\u00e9's discomfort is valid, but the financial responsibility is a point of contention. The author could be seen as making a reasonable request, especially if he's trying to save money for a house. However, the way he presented it might have been harsh, making it seem like he's not considering her feelings. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it depends on whether the author is in the wrong for not covering the hotel. If they agreed earlier to stay with the parents, and the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind, maybe the author is justified in not covering the cost. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is the one asking for the hotel and is willing to pay for it herself could mean the author isn't at fault. However, the argument about the wedding and the house might complicate things, as the fianc\u00e9 is bringing up her own financial contributions. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting boundaries about his finances. The fianc\u00e9 is making her own choice to stay in a hotel and is responsible for the cost. The author isn't forcing her to stay with his parents, but he's not going to pay for an alternative he didn't agree to. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is upset might be more about the conflict in their expectations than the author being wrong.\n"
