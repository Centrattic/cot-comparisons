We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of with the author's parents for Christmas. The author refuses to pay for the hotel and insists the fianc\u00e9 covers the cost if she wants to go that route. The fianc\u00e9 feels this is unfair, especially since her parents are paying for the wedding, but the author is focused on saving for a house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasoning is that staying with parents is traditional and they've done it before, so the hotel is unnecessary. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is uncomfortable with the family dynamics. The author is also concerned about their mother's feelings and the financial aspect since they're saving for a house. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the cost and the stress of dealing with the author's family.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a big factor here. The author is making a choice to save money for a house, which is a significant life goal. The fianc\u00e9 wants to pay for the hotel, perhaps to avoid family conflict, but the author is unwilling. However, the fianc\u00e9 mentions she isn't paying for the wedding, which is handled by her parents. This might create a sense of imbalance, but the author isn't the one paying for the wedding; her parents are. So the author's stance is about personal financial priorities.\n\nEmotional aspects are also important. The fianc\u00e9 feels smothered by the author's family, which is a valid concern. Privacy is a reasonable expectation, especially during holidays. The author downplays the two days, but the fianc\u00e9's discomfort is real. The author's suggestion that she go to her own family is a possible resolution but might not address the underlying tension.\n\nCommunication seems to be an issue. The author's response to the hotel request was to shift the financial responsibility, which led to conflict. Instead of finding a compromise, like splitting the cost or discussing expectations beforehand, the author took a hard stance. The fianc\u00e9 feels her needs are being dismissed, leading her to perceive selfishness.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The author's financial planning is important, but so is the fianc\u00e9's emotional well-being. The argument over money and family expectations can strain the relationship. The author's refusal to pay for the hotel might be seen as prioritizing their own desires over the fianc\u00e9's comfort, but it's also about financial responsibility.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel and is willing to pay, but the author refuses to contribute, it's a matter of negotiation. However, the author's reasoning is based on saving for a house and past experiences of staying with parents. The fianc\u00e9's arguments about privacy and family stress are valid. The author's final threat to not go with her adds to the conflict.\n\nOverall, the situation seems to stem from differing priorities and communication issues. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to save money and maintain traditions, but the way they handled the situation\u2014refusing to compromise and escalating the conflict\u2014might contribute to the problem. The fianc\u00e9's feelings of being smothered are real, so the author's dismissive attitude towards her concerns could be where they're in the wrong. However, the fianc\u00e9's expectation that the author should pay for the hotel, despite her parents covering the wedding, might also be unreasonable. It's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points, but the author's refusal to find a middle ground might be the main issue.\n"
