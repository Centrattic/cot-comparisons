We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself because she refuses to stay with his parents on Christmas. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple usually stays at the author's parents' house for Christmas, but this year the fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy. The author is refusing to pay for it because they've done this before and it's only two nights. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels abandoned, and the author is countering by making her pay if she wants to go to the hotel. The fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding, which the author is trying to save for a house.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is valid. Even two days can feel long if the environment is stressful, especially with strong personalities in the family. The author is being inflexible and not considering her feelings. Making her pay for the hotel after she's already upset is a bit harsh. The author's reasoning about saving money for a house is understandable, but maybe they could have found a compromise. Instead of making her choose between her comfort and paying, they could have discussed splitting costs or looking for a cheaper option. The author's reaction seems to stem from prioritizing family traditions over the fianc\u00e9's needs, which might be the issue here. The fianc\u00e9's feelings of being smothered are important in a relationship, and the author isn't acknowledging that. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more empathetic and for making it a financial ultimatum.\n"
