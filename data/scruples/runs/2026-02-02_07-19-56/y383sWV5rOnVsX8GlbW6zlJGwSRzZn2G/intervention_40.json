We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong. The situation is about whether to stay with the author's parents or get a hotel for Christmas.\n\nFirst, the author is unwilling to pay for the hotel, so they're making their fianc\u00e9 pay. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy because the parents' house is crowded and there's a lot of extended family. The author's points are that it's just two nights and they've stayed before. But the fianc\u00e9 feels smothered and wants the hotel. \n\nThe author argues that they can't afford the hotel and expects the fianc\u00e9 to pay. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels abandoned, and mentions the author's financial situation (parents paying for an expensive wedding), while the author is saving for a house. \n\nThe author's reasoning seems to prioritize their own financial plans and their parents' feelings over the fianc\u00e9's comfort. The fianc\u00e9's need for privacy is valid, especially given the family dynamics. Making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel because they want privacy might be seen as unfair, especially if the author is the one controlling the finances. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about the fianc\u00e9's parents paying for the wedding might come off as dismissive of her feelings. The author is asking the fianc\u00e9 to sacrifice comfort and privacy for their parents' preferences, which could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, while both have valid points, the author is placing the financial burden on the fianc\u00e9 for a preference that the author isn't willing to accommodate themselves. That could make the author in the wrong.\n"
