We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is engaged and plans to visit their parents for Christmas. They've stayed with their parents before, but this time the fianc\u00e9e wants a hotel instead. The author thinks two nights isn't a big deal and doesn't want to pay for a hotel. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, feels smothered by the author's family, and there's some tension about money since the author is saving for a house while the fianc\u00e9e's parents are paying for a big wedding. The author made the fianc\u00e9e pay for the hotel if she wants it, leading to a fight.\n\nHmm. So, the main issues here are about compromise, financial responsibility, and family dynamics. The author believes staying with parents is fine and is reluctant to spend money, while the fianc\u00e9e wants privacy and is upset the author isn't covering the hotel cost. \n\nI think both sides have some points. The author might be seen as not respecting the fianc\u00e9e's need for privacy, especially if the family's strong personalities are making her uncomfortable. On the other hand, the author is trying to save money for a house, which is a significant long-term goal. The fianc\u00e9e's parents are already paying for the wedding, but the author is contributing to the hotel. It's a matter of how they handle shared expenses and expectations.\n\nBut does the author have a right to make the fianc\u00e9e pay for the hotel? Maybe not, because they're in a committed relationship. Even if the author is saving money, it's a holiday and some flexibility might be expected. The author's stance could come off as selfish, especially if the fianc\u00e9e is genuinely uncomfortable. However, the author isn't wrong for wanting to manage their finances. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable in this specific situation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e wants a hotel for two nights, which the author thinks is unnecessary. The author's response to make her pay for it alone seems to be a way to avoid spending money but also to assert their position. In a relationship, it's important to find a middle ground. Maybe splitting the cost or finding a cheaper option could be a solution. However, the author's refusal to compromise and the ultimatum might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is partially in the wrong for not being more understanding of the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and for not being willing to share the cost. Relationships require compromise, and the author's response might be seen as selfish. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reaction might also be overblown if it's just two nights, but her discomfort is valid. The author's reasoning about saving for a house is a good point, but maybe they could have found a way to accommodate both needs without a fight. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9e's valid concerns and instead made a rigid decision. The expectation in a relationship is to support each other, even if there are financial disagreements. Making the fianc\u00e9e pay the entire cost without considering her feelings might be the mistake here.\n"
