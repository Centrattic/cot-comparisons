We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding a situation with their fianc\u00e9 and parents during Christmas. The author wants to stay with their parents, while the fianc\u00e9 prefers a hotel. The author insists the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she insists on that, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: staying with parents is traditional, it's only two nights, and they don't want to spend extra money. They mention the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding, so maybe they feel the fianc\u00e9 isn't contributing financially here. The author also brings up their mother's feelings, indicating sensitivity around family dynamics.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective: she wants privacy, feels smothered by the author's family, and is upset about the financial aspect. She might see the author as being selfish for not accommodating her needs, even if it's a short stay. The argument about the wedding costs could be a red herring or a way to justify her stance.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The author's stance is about not wanting to spend money and respecting their parents' wishes. The fianc\u00e9's stance is about personal comfort and privacy. Both have valid points. However, the author is forcing the fianc\u00e9 to choose between staying with family or paying for a hotel, which might not consider her feelings. Marriage involves compromise, and the author's refusal to split the cost or find a middle ground might be seen as inconsiderate. The author also mentions the fianc\u00e9's parents paying for the wedding, which could imply a sense of obligation, but that's a different issue. The key is whether the author's rigid stance is unreasonable. Since the fianc\u00e9 is within her rights to prefer privacy and the author is refusing to share the cost, the author might be seen as being inflexible. However, the author isn't wrong for setting a boundary about their money. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs. The author's refusal to meet halfway (like splitting the cost) could tip the scales towards being in the wrong. So I think the answer is A, but there's nuance here.\n"
