We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house during Christmas. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and made the fianc\u00e9 pay herself, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is planning to visit their parents for Christmas, which they've done before. The fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for two nights, citing lack of privacy because there will be other guests. The author thinks it's just two nights and doesn't want to spend the money, leading to a financial disagreement. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling abandoned, and brings up the wedding costs, but the author is saving for a house instead of a big wedding.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The author is prioritizing saving money for a house, which makes sense for future stability. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is seeking privacy during a holiday, which is understandable, especially if the parents' home is crowded. The author's parents might be hurt because they're not seeing their child as often, adding emotional pressure.\n\nThe author's stance is about financial responsibility. They might feel that a hotel is unnecessary, especially if they have a history of staying with the parents. However, the fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is a valid concern. The author's response of making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel themselves could be seen as dismissive or not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The argument escalates when the author suggests the fianc\u00e9 go to her own family, which could be a harsh response.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in relationships can be tricky. The author is saving for a house, which is a big life step, but the fianc\u00e9 is also dealing with family dynamics (big wedding paid by her parents). The author's refusal to share the hotel cost might be seen as selfish if privacy is a legitimate need. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction about the wedding costs might be a red herring since she's not actually paying for it. The author's parents' feelings are another layer; the author might be caught between two important relationships.\n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting costs for mutual comfort is common. The author's demand that the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely could be seen as not compromising. The fianc\u00e9's anger might be justified if she feels her needs are being ignored, especially during a holiday. However, the author's financial priorities are also valid. The key is whether the author considered the fianc\u00e9's perspective and found a middle ground, like splitting the hotel cost. Making the fianc\u00e9 pay alone without discussion might be the issue here.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not being flexible on the hotel arrangement and for the harsh remark about the fianc\u00e9 going to her family. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is a reasonable one, and the author could have offered a compromise instead of an ultimatum. The author's focus on saving money is important but shouldn't come at the expense of the fianc\u00e9's comfort during a holiday. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
