We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel instead of staying with his parents on Christmas. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're visiting the author's parents for Christmas. The fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel for two nights because she doesn't like the lack of privacy at the parents' house. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel and is insisting on staying with the parents. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the author is being selfish, and she's also bringing up the wedding expenses. The author mentions that he's trying to save for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a big wedding they can't afford.\n\nHmm. The author is making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel. The question is whether that's wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are about privacy. The author thinks it's just two days and is concerned about the mother's feelings and the family's strong personalities. The fianc\u00e9 feels smothered.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, maybe he's trying to be practical. Staying with parents is cheaper, and they've done it before. He's saving money for a house. But the fianc\u00e9 is in a stressful situation with family, which is a valid concern. The argument is about splitting costs based on preferences.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, insisting that she pays because she wants privacy might be seen as not considering her comfort. Even if it's two nights, if one person prefers a hotel for their well-being, the other might need to compromise. The author's stance seems a bit inflexible. Also, the fianc\u00e9 isn't actually paying for the wedding; her parents are. The author brings up the wedding costs, but maybe that's a red herring. The real issue is about respecting her need for privacy versus his desire to save money and keep the parents' feelings in check.\n\nThe author's response to make her pay could be seen as selfish because he's making her bear the cost of her preference, especially if it's about her comfort. Even if the author is saving money for a house, the relationship should involve mutual consideration. So maybe the author is in the wrong by not being willing to split the cost or find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9's feelings of being smothered by the author's family might be legitimate, and the author isn't addressing that by being rigid. Therefore, the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
