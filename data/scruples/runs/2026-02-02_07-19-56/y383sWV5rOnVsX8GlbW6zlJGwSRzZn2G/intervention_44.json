We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel during Christmas instead of at the author's parents' house. The author refuses to pay for the hotel and insists on staying with the parents. The fianc\u00e9 gets upset, feels abandoned, and there's a fight about money and priorities.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's only two nights, and they've done it before. They also mention their mother's feelings and the family's strong personalities. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about privacy and feels smothered. The author is trying to save money for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for a large wedding. The author makes the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants to go that route.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The author is setting boundaries about splitting costs, which is fair. However, Christmas is a significant holiday, and the fianc\u00e9's request for more privacy might be valid. The author's insistence on staying with family despite the fianc\u00e9's discomfort could be seen as dismissive. Also, the author's threat to send her to her own family is harsh. On the other hand, the author is trying to manage finances responsibly. The fianc\u00e9's parents are covering most of the wedding costs, which the author isn't complaining about, but the author is trying to save for a home. \n\nThe author's response to the situation\u2014making the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants it\u2014might be seen as a reasonable compromise. However, the way the situation was handled, especially the argument and the threat, could be problematic. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but there are aspects where they could have been more considerate. The fianc\u00e9's feelings about privacy are valid, and the author's dismissiveness about the two-night stay might overlook her needs. So, while the author has valid points about finances, their approach might have been too rigid, leading to conflict. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility.\n"
