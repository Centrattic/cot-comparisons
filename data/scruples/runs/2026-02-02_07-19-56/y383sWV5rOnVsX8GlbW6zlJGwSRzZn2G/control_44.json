We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is at fault for making their fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel herself because she refuses to stay with his parents on Christmas. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their fianc\u00e9 are planning to visit his parents for Christmas. They've done this before at the parents' house. This time, the fianc\u00e9 wants to stay in a hotel for two nights due to lack of privacy. The author is refusing to pay for the hotel, arguing that it's only two nights and the parents are already upset they don't see him much. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels abandoned, and accuses the author of being selfish. The author is considering letting her go to her family but is worried about the consequences.\n\nThe key points here are about compromise, expectations, and financial responsibility. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants privacy, which is a valid concern, especially during a holiday. The author is trying to save money for a house and is already paying for most of the wedding. However, the author is insisting that the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants that, which could be seen as not considering her needs.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's only two nights and staying with the parents is the traditional plan. But the fianc\u00e9's discomfort with the family (strong personalities, lack of privacy) is a real issue. The author might be prioritizing his parents' feelings and financial savings over his fianc\u00e9's comfort. The fact that the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for the wedding, which is elaborate and expensive, while the author is trying to save for a house adds another layer. The author is essentially asking the fianc\u00e9 to handle her own holiday plans if she's not comfortable, which could be seen as selfish, especially since they are a couple and should support each other's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also within their rights to be mindful of spending, especially if they're saving for a house. But the problem is that the author is not offering a middle ground. Instead of finding a compromise, like maybe splitting the hotel cost or finding a balance between staying with the parents and having some privacy, the author is taking a hard stance. That could be where the fault lies. Relationships require compromise, and it seems like the author isn't willing to meet halfway here, leading to the fianc\u00e9 feeling unsupported and the fight escalating.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be at fault for not compromising and for making the fianc\u00e9 pay entirely for her comfort, especially when the issue is about their shared holiday plans. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not considering their partner's valid concerns and are taking a rigid stance instead of finding a solution that works for both.\n"
