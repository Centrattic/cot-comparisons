We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the fianc\u00e9 wanting to stay in a hotel instead of the author's parents' house for Christmas, and the author making her pay for it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is not willing to pay for a hotel because they've stayed at the parents' house before. The fianc\u00e9 wants privacy and is upset about the author's mother's feelings. The author is also concerned about family dynamics and the cost of the wedding versus their savings for a house.\n\nThe key points here are about compromise and mutual respect. The author's stance is that they're not spending money on a hotel, so the fianc\u00e9 has to pay. The fianc\u00e9 feels this is unfair, especially since her family is paying for the wedding. The author is trying to save for a house, which is a valid financial concern.\n\nBut relationships require negotiation. The author's refusal to compromise might come off as selfish, even if their reasoning is practical. The fianc\u00e9's desire for privacy isn't unreasonable, and the author's reaction to her choice (making her pay or not going at all) could be seen as dismissive. While the author has valid points about tradition and cost, the way they handled the situation might be the issue. Forcing the fianc\u00e9 to choose between her comfort and the author's parents' feelings without finding a middle ground could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but their approach lacks flexibility. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they have their reasons, but there's definitely room for criticism in how they handled it. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. The author's decision to make the fianc\u00e9 pay if she wants the hotel is a boundary, but the fianc\u00e9's reaction might be overblown. It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily wrong, but their response could be improved. So, the answer might be B.\n"
