We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the fianc\u00e9 should pay for the hotel instead of staying with the author's parents for Christmas.\n\nFirst, the author argues that staying with their parents is cheaper and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy because there are other guests. The author says it's only two nights, so privacy shouldn't be a big issue. They also mention their mother's feelings might be hurt since they don't see her often. The author is trying to save money for a house, while the fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for an expensive wedding. The author insists the fianc\u00e9 pay for the hotel if she wants to go that route, leading to a fight. The fianc\u00e9 feels the author is being selfish and abandoning her on Christmas.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider both sides. The author has a valid point about saving money and the short duration. However, the fianc\u00e9's request for privacy is understandable, especially if previous stays were uncomfortable. The author's response to make her pay the whole bill might be seen as inflexible. The author's mention of financial priorities (house vs. wedding) adds complexity. The fianc\u00e9's parents are covering the wedding costs, which the author hasn't had to pay for, but the author is saving to buy a house. \n\nThe key issue here is compromise. The author is not budging on covering the hotel costs, which could be seen as not respecting the fianc\u00e9's needs. The fianc\u00e9's request for privacy isn't unreasonable, especially if she's felt smothered before. The author's reaction to the fight might come off as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is managing their finances responsibly and considering their parents' feelings. But in a relationship, both partners' comfort levels should be considered. Maybe a middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a cheaper option, could work. However, the author's ultimatum to pay the whole bill themselves or not go might be too rigid. \n\nSo, the author's stance might be seen as less flexible. While they have valid financial reasons, the lack of willingness to accommodate the fianc\u00e9's comfort could be viewed as selfish. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're not compromising and are making the fianc\u00e9 bear the cost entirely, which could be seen as unfair, especially since she's already stressed about the wedding expenses.\n"
