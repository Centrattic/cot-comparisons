We\u2019ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there\u2019s no privacy at my parents\u2019 (Which is true - we won\u2019t be the only guests there. But it\u2019s literally two nights!). \n\nAside from that I\u2019m already going to have to deal with my mother\u2019s hurt feelings over this since I don\u2019t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fianc\u00e9 feels somewhat smothered. But again, it\u2019s two freaking nights. \n\nAnyway I told her that I\u2019m not spending money on a hotel room and that I\u2019m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she\u2019s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she\u2019s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn\u2019t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they\u2019re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I\u2019m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). \n\nAnyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I\u2019m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I\u2019ll see her afterward. But I feel like she\u2019d actually kill me so I haven\u2019t said that. \n\nAITA here??\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about whether they should pay for a hotel instead of staying with his parents for Christmas. \n\nFirst, the author argues that staying at his parents' house is cheaper and they've done it before. The fianc\u00e9 wants a hotel for privacy, but he's not willing to pay for it, so he's insisting she pays if she wants that. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feels abandoned, and there's some tension about wedding costs and financial priorities.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, he's standing his ground on the hotel expense. He's trying to save money for a house, which is a valid financial goal. His parents' home is an option, even if it's not ideal. The fianc\u00e9's complaints about privacy are understandable, but two nights might not justify the cost. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might be too rigid. Maybe there's a middle ground, like splitting the cost or finding a budget-friendly hotel. Also, considering his mother's feelings adds another layer. The author might be dismissive of his fianc\u00e9's discomfort with family dynamics. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, he's not in the wrong for not wanting to spend unnecessary money. The fianc\u00e9 is the one making the request, so it's reasonable to expect her to cover the expense. The fact that her parents are paying for the wedding complicates things, but that's separate. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's room for compromise. The situation depends on balancing financial responsibility with emotional considerations. The author isn't necessarily at fault for setting boundaries on spending, especially for a short period. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be over the top, given the duration and the alternative available. \n\nBut maybe the author could have been more empathetic. Still, the core issue is financial responsibility versus personal comfort. Since the author is not forcing her to stay with his parents but is offering that option without cost, he's not wrong to expect her to pay for the hotel if she prefers it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
