This particular crime is something the people of reddit demonize others for - I was at a friends house for my birthday and my friend made me dinner and had bought some wine for us to share. I had 2 glasses of wine over the course of about 2+ hours and felt tired. I got pulled over for doing about 6 miles over the speed limit and blew a .09, I blew several more times and my BAC kept going down each time. Both my lawyer and the cop told me it would have probably been under a .08 if I had waited another hour. I never would have driven if I knew I was over the limit, my group of friends were always the type to play it safe. We shared cab fare, had DDs, rented hotel rooms downtown, or spent the night at various friends places whenever we planned on drinking. It never occurred to me that my body couldn\u2019t process wine in a little over 2+ hours. \n\n\nI was devastated when this happened, I fell into a deep depression. I was convinced I would never have friends again, no one would care for me, I would never get a job again, I was not worthy of love, etc. My depression was compounded by the fact my my aunt (mom\u2019s sister) and my aunt\u2019s son (cousin) would basically tell me that I was a total piece of shit. They told me that I should be locked away and forgotten about. They told me I was worthless. They would refer to me as \u201ccriminal\u201d and not my actual name. They would call me an alcoholic. They told me I would never get married because no one could love someone who is criminal scum. And for the first year after this happened I believed them. I stopped seeing any of my friends, I was terrified of even having any sort of alcohol in my apartment, I stopped having any sort of life because I knew I was absolutely worthless. \n\n\nI\u2019d visit my parents occasionally and sometimes my aunt would be there, and she would turn the topic around to me and what I did. I\u2019d see my aunt and cousin around the holidays and various family events, they made sure to spread the gossip around so everyone knew. It was so incredibly embarrassing. Prior to falling in to a deep depression I was the type to hike, run 5ks, participate in bike marathons, lift weights and volunteered a lot of nonprofits with my friends. Our group frequently volunteered with Habitat For Humanity multiple times a year, and I stopped doing this. \n\n\nThis happened back in 2008, it\u2019s now 2018 and my aunt and cousin always bring it up everytime I see them. They couldn't help but to call me out whenever they saw me, they would make a snide comment and I'd feel like shit all over again. It took me a long time to get out of my depression because of them. I finally managed to lose weight and become a better person over time. \n\n\nI finally snapped this past Thanksgiving. Just like the last 10 Thanksgiving and the last 10 Xmases they spend a good portion of the day making horrible \u201cjokes\u201d at my expense. I hosted Thanksgiving this year, and my mom really wanted aunt and cousin to come, she said that she had talked to her sister and that she wouldn\u2019t bring up my dwi this year. I was skeptical but my husband and I really wanted to host and cook this year, as it would be our first thanksgiving as a married couple. \n\n\nAunt and cousin didn\u2019t keep their promise. Cousin saw our wine rack, asked if he should call \u201cthe betty ford clinic for me.\u201d They asked my husband how he could marry a criminal and if he happened to be a felon, unemployed or an alcoholic - because they couldn\u2019t imagine any other type to marry a low life like me. Aunt asked if my job had found out about my past yet, b/c they\u2019ll probably fire me when they discover it. She asked how I was able to have a \"real office job with computers\" and not some shitty retail position with a criminal history like mine. She inquired how a criminal was able to own a home. She asked if I had started to drinking as soon as I got up that day. She wonders how it\u2019s possible for me to be so thin when alcohol has so many calories in it and implied I must have a \"liquid diet\" and only eat solids on special occasions. They kept making passive aggressive comments like this throughout the evening. My husband opened a bottle of wine (he doesn\u2019t give a shit what these people say, and if he feels like having a glass of wine with dinner, he\u2019s going to have one. My ability to care was also fading, so I had him pour me a glass too). So, I had a glass of wine (in my own fucking home) and my aunt said \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t planning on driving after that, we all know you can\u2019t control yourself.\u201d After she said that I kinda lost my shit. \n\n\nI basically said something along the lines of - \n\n\n\u201cFor a criminal scumbag I sure have accomplished a lot more than you and your son combined. Your kid is in his 30s and hasn\u2019t left home yet, and is a college drop out who never found a real job because his only talents are sitting on his ass and playing video games.  I\u2019ve been with the same company for the past 7 years and just got another promotion with a hefty pay raise, alcoholics can\u2019t do that. I have a house and a wonderful husband, you\u2019ve had two failed marriages and can\u2019t seem to keep a new man for more than a few months. Also, have you noticed how thin and muscular I am? You can\u2019t build muscle when you\u2019re an alcoholic! The only thing you and your idiot son ever have to say is about something stupid I did 10 fucking years ago. And I think I know why - you literally have nothing interesting going on in your life at all, the only thing remotely interesting you ever have to talk about is ME. Maybe if you found a hobby - how about dieting and maybe trying to eat a vegetable for the first time in your fucking life - you could perhaps come up with a new god damn topic other than something dumb I did when I was in my early 20s for fucks sake.\u201d \n\n\nIt was awkward after that. My two siblings thought it was hilarious, they never liked aunt much anyway, and would be quick to defend me in the past. Mom tried to play shitty mediator by saying I shouldn\u2019t have yelled or swore, but it\u2019s okay for me to defend myself, and told my aunt that she\u2019s always too hard on me and to let it go. Dad never liked aunt basically told aunt she was asking for it. Cousin responded with just a \u201cfuck you\u201d and was huffy and silent until they left. Aunt was in hysterics about being spoken to in a such a manner, and that I\u2019m an entitled and ungrateful \u201clittle girl\u201d. Husband asked aunt and cousin to leave, they say more mean things and finally leave. Mom is still kinda angry with me for making a big fuss and told me that her sister likes to be crass and make jokes, but she\u2019s still family and I should eventually apologize to aunt and cousin. I don\u2019t share this feeling with my mom. Wanted to see if I should apologize and just accept they will continue to say horrible things to me. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for yelling at their aunt on Thanksgiving. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author had a DWI incident 10 years ago. They mention that they were at a friend's house, had two glasses of wine over two hours, and got pulled over with a BAC of .09. They didn't drive again after that because they thought they were over the limit. Their lawyer and the cop said they might have been under .08 if they waited an hour. The author is clear that they didn't mean to drive drunk and that it was a mistake. They felt awful, got depressed, and stopped their usual activities like volunteering and exercising. Their aunt and cousin kept bringing up the incident repeatedly over the years, making passive-aggressive comments, which made the author feel like a criminal and contributed to their depression. Now, in 2018, during Thanksgiving, the aunt and cousin again made these comments, leading the author to snap and yell back with some pretty harsh words, including insults about their cousin's job, the aunt's relationships, and their physical appearance. The author's mom is telling them to apologize, but they don't want to.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. Let's break it down. The aunt and cousin have been consistent in their harsh treatment for a decade. They've been making the author feel bad repeatedly, which is harmful. The author tried to set boundaries by hosting the event and the mom even asked the aunt not to bring it up. When the aunt and cousin didn't respect that boundary, the author's emotional response was to yell back. The key question is whether that response is justified.\n\nOn one hand, yelling and using harsh language, including swearing and personal attacks, might be seen as inappropriate, especially in a family setting. Even if the aunt was being cruel, the author's response could escalate the situation and potentially hurt the aunt and cousin further. The author's insult about their cousin not finding a job and the aunt's marriage history might be crossing into personal territory, which isn't fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the prolonged abuse and belittlement from family members over a past mistake, even if it was a serious one, can be incredibly damaging. The author was dealing with the aftermath of their own depression and the constant reminders from family likely made it worse. The fact that they tried to set boundaries and the aunt and cousin didn't respect them might justify the author's frustration. Yelling could be a reaction to years of emotional pain, not just the one instance on Thanksgiving.\n\nThe situation is complex. The aunt and cousin's behavior is definitely hurtful and unkind, and they shouldn't have brought up the DWI again, especially after being asked not to. However, the author's response was aggressive and included personal jabs. While it's understandable that they were angry and hurt, the way they expressed it might be seen as going too far. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling the need to defend themselves, but the method (yelling with harsh language and insults) could be problematic. Some might say that even if the aunt was in the wrong, the author should have handled it with more composure to avoid further conflict. Others might argue that after years of abuse, the author had the right to set a boundary, even if it was done in a heated manner.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the aunt's behavior is clearly wrong, but the author's reaction might not be entirely justified. They were in a high-stress, emotionally charged environment (Thanksgiving with family), and the aunt violated a promise. The author's response was a culmination of years of stress, so maybe it's understandable. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on the societal expectation of handling such situations with grace versus understanding the emotional trauma involved.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because, while the aunt and cousin were being cruel, the author's response was also unkind and likely made the situation worse. They could have addressed the issue without attacking their aunt and cousin's personal lives. The author's intent was to defend themselves, but the method was aggressive and disrespectful. Even if the aunt's actions were wrong, the author's yelling might not be the right approach. However, others might see the author's actions as justified given the long-term mistreatment. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so maybe they're leaning that way. I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author was in their home, hosting, and the aunt broke a promise. The insults were in response to the aunt's provocation. The author might not be in the wrong because they were standing up for themselves after being bullied. Hmm, this is a tough call. But I think traditionally, in these kinds of questions, the answer often leans towards the person who broke the promise and continued to be cruel, but the one who yelled might also be considered at fault for the reaction. However, given the context of years of emotional abuse, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong). Wait, the user said they think the author is in the wrong. The initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. The aunt's behavior is inexcusable, but the author's response, while justified in intent, might be seen as not the right approach. The answer could be A, but considering the emotional trauma and the aunt's continuous provocation, maybe B is more accurate. I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me re-read the key points: the author was in a depression, the aunt and cousin kept reminding them of the past, leading to isolation and loss of self-worth. The author finally snaps after being provoked. The response was defensive and counter-attacking, which might be seen as justified in some eyes, especially if they felt attacked again. The mom wants the author to apologize, but if the aunt and cousin are unrepentant, an apology might not be necessary. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
