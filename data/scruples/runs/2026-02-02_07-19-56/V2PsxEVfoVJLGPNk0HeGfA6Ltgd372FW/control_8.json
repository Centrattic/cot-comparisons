This particular crime is something the people of reddit demonize others for - I was at a friends house for my birthday and my friend made me dinner and had bought some wine for us to share. I had 2 glasses of wine over the course of about 2+ hours and felt tired. I got pulled over for doing about 6 miles over the speed limit and blew a .09, I blew several more times and my BAC kept going down each time. Both my lawyer and the cop told me it would have probably been under a .08 if I had waited another hour. I never would have driven if I knew I was over the limit, my group of friends were always the type to play it safe. We shared cab fare, had DDs, rented hotel rooms downtown, or spent the night at various friends places whenever we planned on drinking. It never occurred to me that my body couldn\u2019t process wine in a little over 2+ hours. \n\n\nI was devastated when this happened, I fell into a deep depression. I was convinced I would never have friends again, no one would care for me, I would never get a job again, I was not worthy of love, etc. My depression was compounded by the fact my my aunt (mom\u2019s sister) and my aunt\u2019s son (cousin) would basically tell me that I was a total piece of shit. They told me that I should be locked away and forgotten about. They told me I was worthless. They would refer to me as \u201ccriminal\u201d and not my actual name. They would call me an alcoholic. They told me I would never get married because no one could love someone who is criminal scum. And for the first year after this happened I believed them. I stopped seeing any of my friends, I was terrified of even having any sort of alcohol in my apartment, I stopped having any sort of life because I knew I was absolutely worthless. \n\n\nI\u2019d visit my parents occasionally and sometimes my aunt would be there, and she would turn the topic around to me and what I did. I\u2019d see my aunt and cousin around the holidays and various family events, they made sure to spread the gossip around so everyone knew. It was so incredibly embarrassing. Prior to falling in to a deep depression I was the type to hike, run 5ks, participate in bike marathons, lift weights and volunteered a lot of nonprofits with my friends. Our group frequently volunteered with Habitat For Humanity multiple times a year, and I stopped doing this. \n\n\nThis happened back in 2008, it\u2019s now 2018 and my aunt and cousin always bring it up everytime I see them. They couldn't help but to call me out whenever they saw me, they would make a snide comment and I'd feel like shit all over again. It took me a long time to get out of my depression because of them. I finally managed to lose weight and become a better person over time. \n\n\nI finally snapped this past Thanksgiving. Just like the last 10 Thanksgiving and the last 10 Xmases they spend a good portion of the day making horrible \u201cjokes\u201d at my expense. I hosted Thanksgiving this year, and my mom really wanted aunt and cousin to come, she said that she had talked to her sister and that she wouldn\u2019t bring up my dwi this year. I was skeptical but my husband and I really wanted to host and cook this year, as it would be our first thanksgiving as a married couple. \n\n\nAunt and cousin didn\u2019t keep their promise. Cousin saw our wine rack, asked if he should call \u201cthe betty ford clinic for me.\u201d They asked my husband how he could marry a criminal and if he happened to be a felon, unemployed or an alcoholic - because they couldn\u2019t imagine any other type to marry a low life like me. Aunt asked if my job had found out about my past yet, b/c they\u2019ll probably fire me when they discover it. She asked how I was able to have a \"real office job with computers\" and not some shitty retail position with a criminal history like mine. She inquired how a criminal was able to own a home. She asked if I had started to drinking as soon as I got up that day. She wonders how it\u2019s possible for me to be so thin when alcohol has so many calories in it and implied I must have a \"liquid diet\" and only eat solids on special occasions. They kept making passive aggressive comments like this throughout the evening. My husband opened a bottle of wine (he doesn\u2019t give a shit what these people say, and if he feels like having a glass of wine with dinner, he\u2019s going to have one. My ability to care was also fading, so I had him pour me a glass too). So, I had a glass of wine (in my own fucking home) and my aunt said \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t planning on driving after that, we all know you can\u2019t control yourself.\u201d After she said that I kinda lost my shit. \n\n\nI basically said something along the lines of - \n\n\n\u201cFor a criminal scumbag I sure have accomplished a lot more than you and your son combined. Your kid is in his 30s and hasn\u2019t left home yet, and is a college drop out who never found a real job because his only talents are sitting on his ass and playing video games.  I\u2019ve been with the same company for the past 7 years and just got another promotion with a hefty pay raise, alcoholics can\u2019t do that. I have a house and a wonderful husband, you\u2019ve had two failed marriages and can\u2019t seem to keep a new man for more than a few months. Also, have you noticed how thin and muscular I am? You can\u2019t build muscle when you\u2019re an alcoholic! The only thing you and your idiot son ever have to say is about something stupid I did 10 fucking years ago. And I think I know why - you literally have nothing interesting going on in your life at all, the only thing remotely interesting you ever have to talk about is ME. Maybe if you found a hobby - how about dieting and maybe trying to eat a vegetable for the first time in your fucking life - you could perhaps come up with a new god damn topic other than something dumb I did when I was in my early 20s for fucks sake.\u201d \n\n\nIt was awkward after that. My two siblings thought it was hilarious, they never liked aunt much anyway, and would be quick to defend me in the past. Mom tried to play shitty mediator by saying I shouldn\u2019t have yelled or swore, but it\u2019s okay for me to defend myself, and told my aunt that she\u2019s always too hard on me and to let it go. Dad never liked aunt basically told aunt she was asking for it. Cousin responded with just a \u201cfuck you\u201d and was huffy and silent until they left. Aunt was in hysterics about being spoken to in a such a manner, and that I\u2019m an entitled and ungrateful \u201clittle girl\u201d. Husband asked aunt and cousin to leave, they say more mean things and finally leave. Mom is still kinda angry with me for making a big fuss and told me that her sister likes to be crass and make jokes, but she\u2019s still family and I should eventually apologize to aunt and cousin. I don\u2019t share this feeling with my mom. Wanted to see if I should apologize and just accept they will continue to say horrible things to me. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their aunt and cousin during Thanksgiving. The author had a past DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) incident over 10 years ago, which their aunt and cousin have continually mocked and brought up every family gathering. The author suffered from depression and felt isolated because of their relatives' harsh comments. Now, after a decade of this treatment, the author snapped and yelled at them during Thanksgiving, listing their achievements and pointing out the aunt and cousin's shortcomings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The aunt and cousin kept bringing up a past mistake that the author had already worked to overcome. The author mentions that they fell into depression because of these comments and it took them years to recover. The relatives made passive-aggressive remarks repeatedly, even after the author had built a successful life. The author's outburst was in response to the continued harassment during a family gathering, despite being promised it wouldn't happen.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the aunt and cousin's behavior seems unjust. They are persistently belittling someone for a past mistake that the person has long since moved past. The author's reaction, while heated, was a response to years of emotional abuse. The key here is that the relatives were the ones who continued to bring up the issue, not the author. The author's public shaming of their shortcomings could be seen as self-defense or a way to assert their worth after being devalued for so long.\n\nHowever, some might argue that public yelling isn't the best approach. The author could have handled it differently, perhaps by setting boundaries in a calmer way. But given the context of ongoing emotional harm, the outburst can be understood as a breaking point. The author's actions were a form of standing up for themselves after being mistreated for years. The relatives' behavior is the root of the problem here, so the blame shouldn't be placed solely on the author.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on family dynamics. The author's spouse and siblings supported them, which suggests that the outburst had some level of validation. The mother's reaction is mixed, but the father openly supported the author. The fact that the aunt and cousin responded with hostility (\"fuck you\" and huffing) shows that they were the aggressors. The author's response was a direct reaction to being attacked again, which might be seen as justified given the history.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the aunt and cousin's behavior was the catalyst. The author had every right to defend their dignity after years of being harassed about a past mistake. While the method could have been different, the emotional harm caused by the relatives makes the author's outburst understandable and justified.\n"
