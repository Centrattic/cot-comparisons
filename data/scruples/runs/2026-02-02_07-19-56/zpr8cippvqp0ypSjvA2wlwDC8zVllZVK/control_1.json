My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after yelling at her husband for interrupting her dinner. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a busy day with work, a trip to the gym, and picking up the baby. They had an agreement that after her gym, her husband would take care of errands. But he ended up asking her questions about the bassinet and other tasks instead. She was irritated and finally asked when he was leaving, and he delayed. Then, when she started eating and watching a show, he asked her to warm up formula, leading to a confusing exchange that made her lose it and yell.\n\nThe key points here are the prior agreement being broken, the accumulation of stress from a long day, and the interruption during a rare alone time. The husband didn't follow through on his responsibility, which likely added to her frustration. The interruptions during her dinner time, which she explicitly said she wanted to avoid, probably crossed a line. The back-and-forth about the formula might have been the final straw. \n\nHowever, yelling and screaming in front of the baby is definitely not ideal. But the context of her being overworked and the husband not respecting the agreement might mitigate that. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn many such cases, people consider the context of stress and unmet agreements. The husband didn't hold up his end, leading to her justified irritation. The yelling was a reaction to being interrupted after being clear about needing space. So, while yelling isn't ideal, the situation's context might place the blame on the husband more. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
