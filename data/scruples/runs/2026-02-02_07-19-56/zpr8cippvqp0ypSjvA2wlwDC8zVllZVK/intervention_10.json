My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting upset and yelling at their husband when he asked for help with the baby during their alone time.\n\nFirst, the author had a busy day with work and the gym, then picked up the baby from daycare. They had an agreement that after dropping her off to the gym, her husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet). However, the husband didn't leave immediately and instead asked her to help with other tasks and questions. The author felt frustrated and wanted alone time to eat and watch a show. When she finally started eating, he asked her to warm up the baby's formula, leading to a back-and-forth that escalated her frustration, ending in yelling.\n\nNow, considering the context: The husband didn't stick to their agreement. They had planned that he would handle the errand while the author was at the gym. Instead, he took on other tasks and delayed the main responsibility. The author was very clear about needing alone time after the busy day. The interruption came after she felt she had been accommodating by offering to help with other things first. The husband's actions disrupted her time, which she had been looking forward to, and the argument over the formula might have been a breaking point after a day of stress.\n\nBut does this make her right? Yelling and screaming, especially in front of the baby, is generally considered unwise. However, the husband did not follow through on their agreement and interrupted her when she was trying to relax. The author's frustration was due to unmet expectations and accumulated stress. While yelling isn't ideal, the husband also didn't respect her boundaries by interrupting her meal. \n\nBalancing both sides: The husband failed to honor their agreement and interrupted her time, but the author's response was yelling, which could be seen as excessive. However, her frustration was justified given the prior context. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Yelling isn't good, but the situation had contributing factors from both sides. However, in AITA scenarios, if the person's actions were a reaction to the other's failure to follow through, sometimes it's seen as less of their fault. But screaming in front of the baby is a red flag. The husband might have some responsibility for not following the plan, but the author's response might still be considered in the wrong because of the yelling. Hmm. I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the husband did disrupt her, the appropriate response isn't yelling. However, there's nuance here. But based on typical AITA standards, the person who yells is usually considered in the wrong unless there's a compelling reason. Since the husband did interrupt, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. Wait, but the husband had agreed to handle the errand, and the author was trying to get her space. The back-and-forth about the formula might have been the final straw after a day of stress. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is A because the author could have handled it differently instead of yelling, even if the husband was at fault for interrupting. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
