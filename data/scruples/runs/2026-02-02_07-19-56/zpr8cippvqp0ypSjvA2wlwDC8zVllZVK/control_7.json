My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife with a newborn. The wife had a busy day, went to the gym, and wanted some alone time to eat and watch a show. The husband, instead of going out to buy a travel bassinet as they agreed, stayed and asked her to help with various tasks. Then, during her dinner, he asked her to warm up the baby's formula, leading to a conflict where she yelled at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife had a long day and was looking forward to some personal time after work. They had a prior agreement that the husband would handle the bassinet purchase. Instead of following through, he asked her to handle other tasks. When she finally started her dinner, he interrupted to ask for help with the baby's formula, which led to a back-and-forth where she got frustrated and yelled.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she was clear about needing time to herself after a busy day. She offered to help with other tasks before starting dinner but wanted to be left alone once she started eating. The husband's interruption during her dinner, especially with the repeated questions about the formula, could be seen as breaking their agreement and not respecting her time.\n\nOn the husband's side, he might feel he was trying to communicate about necessary household tasks and that he was trying to ensure they were feeding the baby correctly. However, he didn't follow through on his initial responsibility (buying the bassinet), which added to her frustration. His interruption during her dinner time, after she had made it clear she wanted to relax, could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe main issue here is about respecting boundaries and following through on agreed responsibilities. The wife was clear about her needs, and the husband didn't adhere to the agreed-upon tasks, leading to the conflict. Yelling is a strong reaction, but the context of exhaustion and previous frustrations might justify it. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who overstepped or didn't consider the other's feelings. The husband didn't respect her time by interrupting dinner, and she didn't handle it calmly. But the initial breach was his not following through on the bassinet task and then interrupting her. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. However, yelling in front of the baby might be seen as harsh, even if justified. It's a balance between setting boundaries and the method used. The community might lean towards the husband needing to take more responsibility for not respecting her time, but the wife's yelling could be seen as the consequence. However, the AITA answer depends on who is more in the wrong. If the husband broke the agreement and interrupted her, then the wife's frustration is understandable, but her yelling might still be considered wrong. Alternatively, if the husband's actions were the root cause, then the wife isn't in the wrong. I think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband didn't follow through on his responsibilities and interrupted her dinner despite her clear boundaries. Her yelling is a reaction to his inconsiderate actions, so she's not entirely at fault.\n"
