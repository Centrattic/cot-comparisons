My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a couple where the wife is trying to have some alone time after a busy day. They had agreed that the husband would run an errand for the baby while she went to the gym. When she gets back, she's looking forward to dinner and relaxing. The husband, instead of leaving to get the bassinet, starts asking her questions and doing household tasks. She asks if he's done, he says no, and they finish the finances. Then she starts eating and watching a show. Five minutes into her show, the husband asks her to warm up formula for the baby. They have a back-and-forth about the amount, and she gets upset and yells at him. The husband thinks she was wrong for yelling in front of the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their agreement. They had agreed that after she left for the gym, he would run the errand. But he didn't leave right away; he started asking questions and doing other tasks. She had to prompt him again. So maybe he didn't follow through on their agreement, which could contribute to her frustration. She was tired, had a busy day, and was trying to decompress. The interruption comes when she's just starting to relax. The argument about the formula might be the last straw. She asked if there was anything else before starting dinner, and he said no. So she started, expecting not to be interrupted. The fact that he then asked for help with the baby again might not have been anticipated, but maybe she felt it was an unnecessary interruption.\n\nAlso, the husband's actions: he didn't stick to their original plan. He delayed going to get the bassinet, which was supposed to be his task. Then, when she was trying to eat, he asked for help. She was clear about needing time to relax after working hard. The yelling happened because of the cumulative stress of the day and the interruption. The husband's response is that she was unjustified and scolded her for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife had a right to need personal time after a long day. The husband didn't respect the agreed-upon task, leading to her irritation. The formula issue was a specific trigger, but the root cause was the prior interruptions. The husband's failure to follow through on their agreement might have contributed to the situation. So the wife's reaction could be seen as a result of stress and unmet expectations. \n\nHowever, yelling in front of a baby is not ideal. It's important to manage emotions to avoid scaring the child. But considering the context, maybe her frustration was justified. The question is whether she was in the wrong. If the husband didn't adhere to their plan, leading to her frustration, then she's not entirely at fault. The husband should have left to get the bassinet as agreed and not started other tasks. The final interruption with the formula may not be reasonable if she had already asked if there were more tasks. So, she might be in the right because the husband didn't follow the plan and the interruption was unexpected despite her clear communication. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
