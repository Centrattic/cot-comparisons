My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, the context: She had a very busy day with work and the gym. They had agreed that after she got home from the gym, her husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) to handle something important ASAP. Instead of doing that, he asked her questions about the bassinet and household tasks. She was irritated, set up her dinner, and started watching a show. Five minutes in, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby. There was confusion about the amount, leading to an argument where she ended up yelling at him.\n\nNow, considering the factors: She had a long day and was looking forward to some alone time. They had a prior agreement that he would handle the errand. He didn't stick to that and instead started asking her questions, which she wanted to avoid. Then, the interruption during dinner with the baby's feeding added to her stress. The husband later said she was in the wrong, but she felt he broke their agreement and disrupted her time to rest.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement, which might have contributed to her frustration. However, yelling at him, especially in front of the baby, is a significant action. While she was stressed, the way she reacted could be seen as harsh. On the other hand, the situation was already tense, and the interruptions were adding up. \n\nIt's a balance between respecting each other's needs. She had a right to want some downtime after a busy day, and he might have felt the tasks were important. But yelling isn't the best way to handle it. The husband's scolding her for yelling in front of the baby is also valid, as it could unsettle the child. However, her frustration is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a complicated scenario. But the key points are the broken agreement, the accumulated stress, and the reaction. So, the answer might hinge on whether her reaction was proportionate. Since she had been trying to be clear and the interruptions were ongoing, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. But the yelling could still be seen as a misstep. However, given the context, it's more about mutual understanding. I think the answer is B (No), because the author had valid reasons for frustration, and the husband didn't honor their prior agreement, leading to her outburst. The fault isn't entirely hers.\n"
