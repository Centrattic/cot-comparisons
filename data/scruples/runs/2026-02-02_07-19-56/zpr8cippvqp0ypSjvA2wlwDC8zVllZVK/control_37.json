My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her husband for interrupting her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time. They had an agreement that the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet) after she got home from the gym. However, he didn't leave immediately and instead asked her a bunch of questions and to help with household tasks. She was getting annoyed, told him she wanted to eat and relax. Then, after five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula, leading to a back-and-forth and her yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the agreement wasn't followed, the husband's interruption after she explicitly said she wanted to relax, and the stress from a busy day. The husband thinks she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's reaction is justified. The husband didn't stick to the agreement, kept asking for help instead of going on the errand, which she was already stressed about. She made her boundaries clear and was trying to have downtime. The interruption during dinner and show would be frustrating. However, yelling at him and in front of the baby might be seen as an overreaction, but considering the context, maybe understandable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider the context. If the husband didn't respect her time and kept piling on tasks, her frustration is valid. But yelling could be seen as not the best way to handle it. The husband also has responsibilities with the baby, so maybe both sides have some fault. But the main issue is the husband not adhering to their agreement and interrupting her after she asked not to be. So, the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nHowever, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The husband's actions were a breach of their agreement, and she had communicated her needs clearly. His interruption was unexpected and added stress. So, her yelling might be a result of being overwhelmed. On the other hand, yelling in front of the baby could be seen as harmful, regardless of the reason. \n\nBalancing both sides, the author's reaction is understandable given the circumstances, but maybe there's a better way to handle it. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the husband broke the agreement and kept interrupting, the author isn't entirely at fault. So the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
