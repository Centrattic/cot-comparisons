My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner for the baby.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author had a very busy day with work and the gym, and they had an agreement that her husband would take care of an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she got home. Instead of going to the errand, he asked her questions and assigned her tasks. She was already stressed and tired, and when he finally asked for help with the baby's formula, she got upset and yelled.\n\nNow, considering the agreement they had. The husband didn't follow through on his part, which led to the author's frustration. She had communicated her need for rest and clarity before starting her dinner. The interruptions happened despite her clear communication, which built up her irritation. The final trigger was the formula situation, which seems to be a point of confusion where her husband kept asking questions that weren't straightforward, leading to her outburst.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he might feel that handling the baby's needs is a shared responsibility and that the author's reaction was excessive. However, the key points here are the prior agreement not being honored, the accumulation of tasks before dinner, and the interruption when she was trying to relax. The husband's actions disrupted her time to recover, which is valid. Yelling is never ideal, especially in front of a baby, but the underlying issues are about unmet expectations and stress.\n\nSo, while yelling isn't the best response, the author's reaction is rooted in a buildup of unaddressed stress and broken agreements. Therefore, the fault isn't entirely on her. The husband's actions led to the situation, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
