My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a very busy day, working and going to the gym. They were looking forward to some alone time to relax after coming home. The husband was supposed to run an errand (buy a travel bassinet for their 4-month-old baby) so she could have that time. But instead, he asked her a lot of questions about the purchase and other tasks like balancing finances. She got irritated because she was tired and hungry. She asked him when he was leaving, and he wanted to clarify things. They did the finances, and she thought she was going to start dinner and her show. Then, five minutes into watching Archer, he asked her to warm up the remaining formula. They had a back-and-forth about the amount, which led to her yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, expectations, and stress. The author had clear expectations that she wanted to have some alone time after her busy day. The husband didn't follow through with the agreed-upon task, leading to her frustration. However, the husband might feel that he was trying to get things done and that her reaction was excessive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling. Yelling is a strong reaction, but it's also a release of built-up frustration. The husband didn't stick to the plan, which added stress. On the other hand, the author could have handled the situation with more calmness, perhaps explaining her feelings without yelling, especially in front of the baby.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication breakdown. The husband didn't leave as agreed, which might have been a breach of their initial plan. The author was clear about her need for alone time, and the husband's interruption was unexpected. The formula situation might have been a tipping point, as the constant questions and delays led to her snapping.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both parties might have contributed to the situation. The author could have communicated her stress more effectively before yelling, but the husband not following the agreed plan might have been the root cause. However, yelling, especially in front of a child, is generally not considered appropriate, even if it's a stressful situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be partially at fault for how she reacted, even if the husband didn't stick to the plan. But I'm not sure if it's entirely her fault. Maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, maybe B because the husband didn't follow through and the stress was real. Hmm.\n"
