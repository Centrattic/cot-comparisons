My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wife who yells at her husband when he interrupts her dinner by asking for help with the baby. The context provided is that she had a busy day at work and the gym, and they had agreed that after she came home from the gym, he would run an errand. But he didn't follow through, asked her a lot of questions, and then eventually asked her to warm up formula, leading to a conflict and her yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author (wife) was promised alone time after her tiring day. She was looking forward to relaxing, eating, and watching a show. The husband, on the other hand, might have felt responsible for the baby but didn't honor their agreement. He asked her questions about the errand and household tasks, which she felt were interruptions. Then, when she was finally starting to relax, he asked her to warm up formula again, causing her to lose her temper.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he's not in the wrong for needing help with the baby. But the wife had already communicated her need for uninterrupted time. The husband might be taking on a lot of responsibilities but didn't stick to their prior arrangement. The yelling in front of the baby is a point he raises, which is understandable as it's not ideal for the child.\n\nBut was the wife justified in yelling? She had been clear about her expectations and the husband didn't follow through. The interruptions might have been cumulative, leading to her frustration. However, yelling, especially in front of the baby, is a strong reaction. Maybe she could have handled it with more calmness. On the flip side, he didn't honor their agreement, which could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nI think the key points here are communication and mutual respect. They had an agreement, and he didn't stick to it. She was explicit about wanting to relax after work, but he kept piling on tasks. The final straw was him interrupting her dinner time. While yelling is a poor choice, especially in front of the child, the underlying issue might be that the husband didn't follow through with his responsibilities, leading to the conflict. The wife might not be entirely in the wrong, but the way she handled it could be improved. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. If the husband broke the agreement and kept interrupting, maybe she isn't. But the act of yelling itself is a negative action. It's a bit of a tough call. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because she could have addressed the issue more calmly, even if the husband didn't follow through. But her husband's actions were also problematic. Maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because the yelling is a red flag, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the husband was at fault for not following the plan, then she might not be in the wrong. Hmm. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually has a clear answer. The husband didn't do what he was supposed to, so he's not helping, and she's justified in being frustrated, but yelling is still bad. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but the husband didn't follow their agreement. So the author's anger might be justified, but the method (yelling) might not be. So the answer is A.\n"
