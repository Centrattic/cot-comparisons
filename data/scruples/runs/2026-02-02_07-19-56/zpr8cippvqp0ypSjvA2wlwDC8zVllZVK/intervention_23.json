My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe author (a woman) had a very busy day with work and the gym. She and her husband agreed that after she got home from the gym, he would run an errand to buy a travel bassinet for their 4-month-old baby. She was looking forward to some alone time to relax, eat dinner, and watch a show she doesn't share with her husband. However, when she got home, instead of leaving, her husband started asking her questions about the bassinet and household tasks like balancing finances. She got irritated and told him she was tired and wanted to eat and relax. He said no more tasks, so she started her dinner. Five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up the baby's formula, but there was confusion about the amount left in the bottle. This led to a back-and-forth where she ended up yelling at him, and he thinks she was wrong to do so in front of the baby.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the husband didn't follow through on their agreement. He was supposed to go out to buy the bassinet after she returned from the gym. Instead, he stayed and started asking her about the purchase and other tasks. This could be seen as a breach of their agreement, leading to her frustration. She was clear about needing some time to herself after a tiring day. When he interrupted her again with the baby's feeding, she was already stressed, which might have contributed to her losing her temper.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might have believed he was just helping out by asking about the bassinet and the finances. He might not have realized how much she needed that alone time. Also, when he asked for the formula, it might have been an urgent need, but the way they communicated led to confusion and frustration. The husband's response to her yelling might be based on concern about setting a bad example for the baby.\n\nI should consider whether the author's reaction was justified. She had been clear about her need for space, and he kept interrupting. The repeated interruptions could have built up her stress, leading to an outburst. However, yelling, especially in front of the baby, could be seen as an overreaction even if she had valid reasons. The husband's responsibility to handle the errand himself might have been neglected, contributing to the situation.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the husband break their agreement? Yes, by not leaving to buy the bassinet. Did he respect her need for space? Not initially. But when he asked for help with the baby, was it an emergency? It might have been. However, the way they communicated led to the conflict. The author's yelling was a response to built-up frustration from multiple interruptions. But yelling is a harsh reaction, even if justified by the circumstances. The husband's scolding about yelling in front of the baby might be valid from a parenting perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the husband didn't follow through on their agreement and kept interrupting her. However, her reaction could be seen as an overreaction. But given the context of her needing space after a long day and the husband's initial failure to comply with their plan, maybe the blame isn't solely hers. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a better balance.\n"
