My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author had a busy day with work and the gym, then they picked up their 4-month-old baby. They agreed that after the author's workout, the husband would run an errand to buy a travel bassinet. However, when the author got home, instead of the husband leaving, he started asking about the bassinet and other tasks. The author was getting irritated but tried to handle it by asking when he was leaving. They took care of finances, and the author was clear they wanted to eat and relax. Then, five minutes into dinner, the husband asked for help with the baby's formula, leading to a back-and-forth about the amount, which escalated into the author yelling.\n\nFirst, the agreement between them was that after the author's gym time, the husband would take care of the errand. He didn't follow through, which is a point of contention. The author was clear about wanting alone time after being exhausted. When the husband interrupted again with the formula issue, the author snapped.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he was trying to handle the task but maybe miscommunicated. However, the author had already been through a lot, and the interruptions were cumulative. The key points are the prior agreement not being honored, the author's clear communication about needing time, and the husband's repeated interruptions. Yelling is not ideal, but the context shows frustration from being overworked and not respected for their need to decompress. The baby's presence adds stress, but the husband's reaction to the yelling might be valid. However, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to yell. Considering the context of exhaustion, prior agreement, and repeated interruptions, the author's reaction is understandable. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
