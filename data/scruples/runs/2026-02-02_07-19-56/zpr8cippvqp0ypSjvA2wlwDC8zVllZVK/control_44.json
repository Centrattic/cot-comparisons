My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote about yelling at her husband is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, context is key. She had a busy day with work and the gym. They agreed that her husband would run an errand after she got home. Instead, he kept asking questions about the bassinet and other tasks. She wanted some alone time to eat and watch a show. Then, five minutes into her show, he interrupts to ask her to warm up formula, leading to a back-and-forth and her yelling.\n\nSo, boundaries. She clearly communicated she wanted to relax after a long day. He didn't stick to their agreement and kept piling on tasks. The interruption during her time to relax probably pushed her over the edge. People need downtime, especially after a tough schedule. Her husband should have respected her request not to be disturbed.\n\nBut, maybe she overreacted? Yelling and screaming could be seen as harsh, especially in front of a baby. However, given the build-up of stress and the interruption during her rare alone time, her reaction might be understandable. Emotional responses are valid, especially when someone's requests are repeatedly ignored.\n\nHe also didn't follow through on their agreement, which adds to the frustration. The constant questions and shifting the task from him to her (feeding the baby) after she already said she wanted to eat. That's a breach of the agreement they had. \n\nThe baby factor complicates things. Yelling in front of the baby is a concern, but it's a single incident. However, the husband's actions in interrupting her might have been the catalyst. \n\nBalancing both sides: She had a right to her time, he didn't adhere to their plan. The escalation happened because he kept interrupting. So, while the yelling might not be ideal, the root cause is his not respecting her needs. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
