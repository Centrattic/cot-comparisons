My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at her husband after he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, the context: The author had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time to eat and relax. They had a plan that the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet) after she got home from the gym. Instead, he asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks, which she found irritating. She finally reminded him about the errand, and they sorted some finances. She insisted she wanted to eat and relax without interruptions. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby. There was confusion about the amount, leading to an argument where she yelled.\n\nSo, the key points here are the expectation of alone time, the husband not following through on his agreed-upon task, and the interruptions during dinner. The author felt stressed and overwhelmed after a long day. The husband, on the other hand, might feel that the baby's needs are urgent and that teamwork is necessary even if it interrupts her time.\n\nThe author had made it clear she needed downtime, and the husband didn't stick to the agreed plan. By asking questions and then interrupting with the baby formula, he didn't respect her needs. However, the baby's needs are also important, and maybe the husband felt it was urgent. The author's reaction was an outburst, which is understandable given her stress, but yelling might have been inappropriate, especially in front of the baby. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014pre-existing stress, the broken agreement, and the interruption after she had already tried to set boundaries\u2014it's clear she was under a lot of pressure. The husband might not have considered the emotional toll of her day. However, the baby's immediate needs should be addressed, but maybe there was a way to handle it without interrupting her so abruptly. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both parties have valid points. The author wanted her time respected, and the husband needed her help with the baby. However, the author was clear about her boundaries, and the husband didn't honor them. The yelling was a result of accumulated stress and broken expectations. While yelling isn't ideal, the underlying issues of broken commitments and lack of empathy from the husband might mean the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author had valid reasons based on being exhausted and the husband not following through on his responsibilities. The yelling was a reaction to ongoing stress and unmet boundaries, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
