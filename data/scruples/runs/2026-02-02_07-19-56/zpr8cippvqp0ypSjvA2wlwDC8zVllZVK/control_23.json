My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple dealing with a baby, work, and household responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the author had a busy day with work and the gym. They agreed that after the author's gym session, the husband would run an important errand. Instead, the husband asked her questions about the errand and other tasks, which she found irritating. She then tried to eat dinner and watch a show alone, but five minutes in, he asked her to help with the baby's formula, leading to a disagreement and her yelling.\n\nSo, key points: They had an agreement. The husband didn't stick to it. He interrupted her time to do tasks she wasn't expecting. She was tired and stressed. The husband felt she was in the wrong for yelling, especially in front of the baby.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The husband agreed to handle the errand but didn't, instead involving her in other tasks. The author was clear she wanted to relax after a long day. The interruption during dinner was unexpected and after she had already prepared to eat. The back-and-forth about the formula added to the stress, leading to her yelling. \n\nBut is yelling justified? Well, the husband didn't follow through on their agreement, which could be a point in her favor. However, yelling in front of the baby might be seen as harsh. But the stress and tiredness are factors. The husband's actions of not sticking to the plan and interrupting her time contribute to the situation. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' actions. The husband didn't uphold his part of the agreement, leading to the author's frustration. The author's response was a reaction to being interrupted and not being respected for her need to rest. While yelling isn't ideal, the context shows he initiated the disruption. \n\nSo, considering the agreement wasn't honored, and the author was under stress, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
