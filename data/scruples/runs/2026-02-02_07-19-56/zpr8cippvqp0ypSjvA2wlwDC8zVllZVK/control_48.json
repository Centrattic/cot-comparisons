My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wife who yelled at her husband after he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author had a busy day with work and the gym. She and her husband had agreed that after she got home from the gym, he would run an important errand (buy a travel bassinet for their 4-month-old baby). But instead of doing that, he asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks like balancing finances. She was tired and hungry, so she told him she wanted to relax and eat. He finally agreed, and she started her dinner and a show. Five minutes into watching, he asked her to warm up formula. There was confusion about the amount, leading to an argument, and she yelled at him.\n\nSo, the key points: They had a prior agreement. He didn't follow through, instead doing other tasks. She was clear about needing alone time. The interruption came after she was already stressed. The baby's care is involved, so maybe he felt it was urgent.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, they had an agreement. If he didn't stick to it, that's his fault. She was clear about not wanting to be disturbed. The husband might be overstepping by interrupting despite her clear communication. The formula issue might have been a trigger because of the prior tension. But yelling in front of the baby could be seen as harsh. However, considering the context\u2014she was exhausted, had been clear, and there was a breach of agreement\u2014her frustration is understandable. The husband's actions disrupted her needed rest, which is important for her well-being. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he broke their agreement and she had communicated her needs clearly. But she did yell, which could be seen as a poor reaction. However, given the circumstances, maybe it's justified. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
