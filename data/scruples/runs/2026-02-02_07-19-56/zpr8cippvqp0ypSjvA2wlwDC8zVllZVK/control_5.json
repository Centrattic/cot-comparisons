My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a busy day, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time to eat and watch a show. They had agreed that her husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she returned from the gym. However, he didn't go and instead asked her about the purchase and other tasks. She was tired and getting irritated, so she tried to set boundaries, asking him not to interrupt once she started eating.\n\nThen, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula. They had a back-and-forth about the amount, which escalated her frustration. She ended up yelling at him, and her husband thinks she was wrong for doing so in front of the baby.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the key points. She had a valid reason for being tired and wanted rest. They had an agreement, but he didn't follow through and instead kept asking for her help. She tried to set boundaries, like asking if there was anything else before starting dinner. When he eventually interrupted, her frustration boiled over.\n\nOn the other hand, her husband might feel that he needed her help with the baby, which is a shared responsibility. However, he did interrupt her time as promised, which could be seen as a breach of their agreement. The yelling could be seen as an overreaction, but it's in the context of accumulated stress and unmet expectations.\n\nI think the author's frustration is understandable given the circumstances. She had communicated her needs and boundaries, and when those were not respected, her reaction, while intense, might be a result of her having reached her breaking point. The husband's actions (not following the agreement and interrupting) contributed to the situation. However, yelling in front of the baby could be a point of contention. But the core issue is about unmet expectations and communication.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband didn't respect her boundaries, and she had a valid reason for her frustration given the day's events and prior agreement.\n"
