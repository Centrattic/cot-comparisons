My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author is at fault for yelling at their husband when he interrupted their dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and then after picking up the baby from daycare, they agreed that the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) while the author went home. The author was looking forward to alone time to eat and watch a show. However, the husband didn't leave right away and instead started asking about the bassinet and other tasks. The author tried to manage this by asking if he was done, which he said yes, so she started eating. Then five minutes in, he asked her to warm up the baby's formula, which led to confusion and arguments about the amount. The author got upset and yelled at him, and now the husband is upset about the yelling in front of the baby.\n\nSo the key points here are the agreement between the couple about responsibilities, the husband not following through on his part leading to the author's frustration, and the interruption during a time the author needed to relax. The husband's actions seem to have violated the agreed-upon plan, which led to the author's outburst. \n\nThe author was clear in stating her needs and boundaries, but the husband kept interrupting despite her asking if there was anything else. The situation with the formula bottle seems like a culmination of stress from the day and the prior interruptions. The husband might argue that feeding the baby is important, but if he had followed through on his original task, maybe the situation wouldn't have escalated. \n\nThe baby being present during the yelling is a concern, but the author was trying to protect her own well-being after a long day. It's a common issue in parenting where shared responsibilities are crucial. The husband's initial breach of the agreement likely contributed to the author's frustration. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's reaction, while understandable as a result of stress and broken agreements, might be seen as justified given the circumstances. However, yelling in front of the baby could be problematic regardless. But the root cause here is the husband not adhering to their plan, leading to the author's outburst. So the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. But according to the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, it's more about whether the action was wrong. Here, the author's yelling is the action in question. If the husband broke the agreement and kept interrupting despite her requests, then her reaction is a response to his actions. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
