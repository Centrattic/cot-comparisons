My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author had a very busy day, worked hard, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time to eat and relax. She and her husband had agreed that after she left, he would run an errand. But he didn't go, instead asking her about the bassinet and other tasks. She got irritated and finally asked him to leave to get the bassinet. He delayed, they balanced finances, and she thought they were done. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula. There was confusion about the amount, leading to a back-and-forth, and she lost it, yelling at him.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The husband didn't follow through on his agreed-upon task, which the author was counting on for her downtime. He also brought up other tasks instead of focusing on the errand, which might have been a breach of their agreement. The author was clear she was tired and wanted to eat and relax. When he interrupted again for the baby's feeding, which was unexpected after she thought they were done, her frustration led to yelling.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might not have realized the impact of his actions. He was trying to take care of the baby, which is a shared responsibility. But he did interrupt her after she had already given him a chance to leave for the errand. The confusion about the formula could have been handled better, but she was already stressed.\n\nI think the author's frustration is understandable given her exhaustion and the prior agreement. However, yelling at him, especially in front of the baby, might be seen as a poor choice. The husband's actions did disrupt her, but he might have been trying to handle the baby's needs. The key is whether her reaction was justified. Since she communicated her needs clearly and he still interrupted, her anger is a response to unmet expectations. However, the method (yelling) could be questioned. But given the context, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
