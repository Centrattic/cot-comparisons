My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a spouse getting yelled at for interrupting the author during dinner to ask for help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to alone time. They had an agreement that the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet) after she got home from the gym. Instead of doing that, the husband asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks. She got irritated, finally agreed to do the finances, and then after eating, he asked her to warm up the formula for the baby. The interaction became a back-and-forth about the amount of formula, leading her to yell at him.\n\nThe author's husband feels she was in the wrong for yelling, especially in front of the baby. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nI need to consider communication and mutual respect. The husband didn't follow the agreement, which might have contributed to her frustration. However, yelling, especially in front of the baby, is generally considered poor communication. The author was clear about wanting to relax, but the husband's actions (asking questions and then the formula issue) might have been unavoidable, given the baby's needs. But why didn't he handle the initial errand as agreed? That's a point in her favor. Also, the husband's interruptions added to her stress. However, the way she reacted (yelling) could have been handled better. Maybe she could have expressed frustration without yelling. The husband not following through on the errand is his fault, but the author's reaction is also problematic. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while the husband made a mistake, the author's yelling is the immediate issue. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because the husband didn't follow the agreement, leading to her stress. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but usually, in these scenarios, the person who yells is considered at fault unless there's a clear provocation. The husband's actions might have been frustrating, but the author's response was excessive. So maybe A is the answer. But I'm not 100% sure. Some might argue the husband should have handled the errand and not interrupted. However, the key here is the yelling. In many cases, the person who yells is seen as the one at fault unless there's a compelling reason. So leaning towards A.\n"
