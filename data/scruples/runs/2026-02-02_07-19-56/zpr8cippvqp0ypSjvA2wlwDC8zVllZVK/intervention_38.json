My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife with a baby. The wife worked a busy day, went to the gym, and expected some alone time to eat and relax. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement to run an errand, instead asking her about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting irritated but tried to be polite, asking if there's anything else he needs. Then, after she starts eating, he asks her to warm up formula, leading to a disagreement and her yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife had a long day and was clearly looking forward to some downtime. She communicated her needs: she wanted to relax after work and eat without interruptions. The husband, however, didn't adhere to their prior agreement about handling the errand and instead brought up other tasks. Then, when she's trying to eat, he interrupts again with the baby's feeding. The key points are communication and boundaries.\n\nThe husband might feel he's trying to get things done, but he didn't respect her need for space after a tough day. The wife set boundaries but felt they were ignored. When he asked for the formula, there was confusion which escalated the situation. The husband might think he's just trying to help, but the wife feels her needs were disregarded. \n\nHowever, the wife did yell and raised her voice in front of the baby, which could be harmful. Even if she felt wronged, yelling might not be the best response. The husband's reaction is that she was unjustified in yelling. There's a balance here between respecting personal boundaries and managing stress in a healthy way.\n\nConsidering all this, the wife was right to set boundaries but maybe lost her temper. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement and interrupted her, which was disrespectful. However, yelling could be seen as an overreaction. So maybe the answer is A, but I need to check if the husband's actions were worse. The wife had valid reasons to be upset, but her method of response might be the issue. So the answer might be A because the author is in the wrong for yelling, even if the situation was frustrating. Alternatively, both have faults. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the husband didn't follow the agreement, maybe she has a case. But the act of yelling is the main issue here. So the answer is A.\n"
