My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between a husband and wife regarding interruptions during dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author had a busy day at work and the gym, and they had an agreement that after she got home, the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet). Instead, he started asking questions about the bassinet and other household tasks. She was tired and wanted to eat and relax. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up the baby's formula, leading to an argument and her yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreement, the husband's actions not matching the agreement, and the interruption during her downtime. The husband thought she was in the wrong for yelling, while she felt justified because he broke their agreement and interrupted her rest time.\n\nThe question is about whether she's at fault. I need to consider both sides. The husband agreed to take care of the errand but didn't, which could be a breach of their agreement. He then asked multiple questions and tasks, which might have been stressful for her after a long day. The interruption during dinner where she wanted to relax could have contributed to her frustration. However, yelling and screaming, especially in front of the baby, is generally considered harsh. Even if she was upset, the method of her response might be seen as excessive.\n\nBut also, the husband's responsibility to the baby might mean that feeding the baby is urgent. However, he could have handled it without interrupting her. Maybe he could have waited or communicated better. The back-and-forth about the formula amount might have been confusing, leading to her frustration.\n\nIn such cases, it's often a shared responsibility. However, the author's main argument is that the husband didn't follow through on the agreement and kept interrupting her. The husband's response might be that he had to take care of the baby's needs, which are important. But he might also be responsible for managing the errand himself without expecting her to do the tasks after she's already home.\n\nConsidering the options A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not), the answer depends on whether the yelling was justified. Since he broke their agreement and kept interrupting her, she had a legitimate reason to be upset. However, the way she reacted (yelling, screaming in front of the baby) might make her at fault in terms of the method. But if the root cause is his actions, maybe she's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. In many such scenarios, the initial stress and breach of agreement can be seen as contributing to her reaction. So perhaps the answer is B (she's not in the wrong) because the husband didn't uphold their agreement and kept interrupting, leading to her justified frustration, even if her reaction was poor. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just about the validity of her feelings. So maybe she is in the wrong for yelling, regardless of the cause. But some would argue that the husband's actions were the root cause. I think in these situations, the answer often leans towards the person not being in the wrong if the other party broke the agreement or was inconsiderate. So maybe B.\n"
