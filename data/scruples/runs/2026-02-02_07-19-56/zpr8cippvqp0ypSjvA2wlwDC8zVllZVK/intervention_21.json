My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves her yelling at her husband after he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. She had a busy day with work and the gym, and they had an agreement that her husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she got home. Instead, he asked her questions about the purchase and other tasks. She got irritated because she wanted alone time to eat and relax. She even checked if there was anything else he needed before she started dinner. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked for help with the baby's formula, leading to confusion about the amount, and she lost her temper.\n\nThe husband thinks she's in the wrong because she yelled in front of the baby. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. They had an agreement. Did he break it by not going to run the errand? Maybe. He asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks, which could be seen as not following through on their plan. That would make her irritated, which is understandable. She even offered to help with anything else before starting dinner, so she was trying to accommodate him. Then the interruption during dinner, which she wanted to be free from, happened. The back-and-forth about the formula might have been frustrating, leading to the outburst.\n\nBut did she have a right to yell? Yelling in front of a baby can be concerning for the child's well-being. However, her perspective is that she was exhausted and the husband wasn't respecting her need for downtime. The husband's responsibility to take care of the errand vs. his own tasks (like feeding the baby) might be a point of contention. \n\nIs she at fault for yelling, or is he at fault for not respecting the agreement and interrupting her? It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband didn't follow through on their agreement and also didn't communicate well about the baby's needs, maybe she's justified. But yelling in front of the baby is a negative action. However, given the context of exhaustion and prior agreement issues, maybe her reaction is understandable. \n\nAlternatively, if the husband was handling the baby, maybe he needed her help, but he should have done it more considerately. The fact that he didn't stick to the plan might have contributed to her outburst. The key factors are the broken agreement, the husband's interruption despite her clear communication, and the stress from the day. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. She was trying to communicate her needs, and the husband didn't follow through. However, the yelling part is a problem. But in AITA scenarios, the focus is often on who is in the wrong. Sometimes the person is considered in the wrong even if their situation is understandable. \n\nBut given that they had an agreement he broke, and then he interrupted her despite her warnings, her frustration is valid. The yelling is a negative action, but the root cause might be on the husband. So maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if she yelled in front of the baby, that could be seen as her fault regardless of the cause. However, the situation is that the husband also didn't follow through on his responsibilities. \n\nI think the answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B) because the husband didn't respect their agreement and interrupted her despite her clear communication. The yelling is a bad reaction, but the context supports her frustration. In AITA, sometimes the person's actions are seen as justified given the circumstances.\n"
