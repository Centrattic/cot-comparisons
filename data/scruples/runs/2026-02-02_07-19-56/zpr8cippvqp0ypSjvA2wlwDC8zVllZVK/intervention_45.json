My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their husband when he interrupted their dinner to help with the baby. The context is that they had a long day, agreed on the husband handling an errand, but he didn't follow through and instead asked for help with other tasks. Then, when they finally started eating, he asked for help with the baby again, leading to a yelling incident.\n\nFirst, the user had a very busy day, which is understandable. They were looking forward to some alone time to relax and eat. The husband didn't stick to their agreement about running the errand and instead started asking about other things. The user tried to set boundaries by asking if there were more tasks to do before dinner. When the husband proceeded to ask for help with the formula, which interrupted their time, the user lost their temper.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The user clearly communicated their need to relax after a long day. The husband, however, didn't respect that boundary by interrupting with the baby request, even after being asked to confirm there were no more tasks. The user's frustration seems justified given the circumstances. However, yelling and screaming, especially in front of the baby, could be seen as an overreaction. The husband might feel that the user's anger was disproportionate, especially if he didn't realize the extent of their exhaustion and need for downtime.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband didn't adhere to their prior agreement and kept adding tasks, which could have contributed to the user's stress. The back-and-forth about the formula amount added to the frustration. The user's intent was to have a clear boundary, but the method of expressing that (yelling) might have crossed a line. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user had valid reasons for being upset, but the way they expressed it might have been unhelpful. The husband, however, also didn't respect the boundaries set. So, maybe the user isn't entirely in the wrong, but their reaction could be seen as a missteps. However, given the context of prior exhaustion and the husband not following through on his responsibilities, the user's frustration is understandable. The question is whether the yelling makes them in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' actions. The user had communicated their needs clearly, the husband didn't respect those needs, leading to the outburst. The user's outburst might be seen as a result of being pushed beyond their limit. So, maybe the answer is that the user isn't in the wrong (B), because the root cause was the husband not respecting boundaries. But others might say that yelling is never acceptable, hence A. \n\nBut given the context, the user's actions are a reaction to the husband's prior actions. So, the user's anger is a response to being interrupted despite setting clear boundaries. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
