My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a busy day, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time to eat and relax. The husband didn't run the errand they agreed on and instead started asking about household stuff. Then, during dinner, he asked for help with the baby's formula, which led to a back-and-forth and the author yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author worked hard, went to the gym, and expected some downtime. They set boundaries by asking if there was anything else to do before dinner. The husband didn't leave as agreed and then interrupted during dinner. That's a lot of stress and tiredness.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband was trying to get the baby fed. He might have thought it was a quick task. But communication was an issue. The author clarified the formula amount multiple times, and the husband kept asking, leading to frustration. Yelling is never good, especially in front of a baby, but the context shows the author was exhausted and had been trying to set boundaries.\n\nThe husband not sticking to their agreement about running the errand is a point against him. The author felt disrespected when their time was interrupted. However, yelling is a poor way to handle it. But considering the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether the author was wrong in getting angry. Since the husband didn't follow through on his part and kept interrupting, the author's frustration is valid. But the response of yelling is where they went wrong. So maybe a mix of both? However, the options are A for yes (author wrong) or B for no. Since the author did yell, which is inconsiderate, but the husband also didn't stick to the plan. The user initially thought the author is wrong. Maybe A is the answer here. But maybe B because the author's actions were a result of being overworked and ignored. Hmm. It's tricky. The user's initial thought is A, but I need to decide. Considering that mutual responsibility is important. The husband should have done his task and not interrupted, but the author yelling is not justified. So A might be correct. But if the husband was also wrong, maybe B. I think in these cases, even if someone is wrong, yelling is not acceptable. So A.\n"
