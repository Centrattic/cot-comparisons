My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple dealing with responsibilities related to a 4-month-old baby. The author had a busy day with work and the gym, and they made an agreement that after she returned from the gym, her husband would run an important errand\u2014buying a travel bassinet. Instead, he asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks, which made her irritated. She finally asked when he was leaving, and he decided to clarify things more. They dealt with finances, and she thought she was done. Then, five minutes into her relaxing time, he asked her to warm up the formula, which led to a back-and-forth and her yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement they had. The husband was supposed to leave to buy the bassinet after she came back from the gym. Instead, he stayed and asked her questions. That might have already broken their agreement, which could be a source of frustration. She was looking forward to a break, which is understandable after a busy day. The interruptions during her dinner time would definitely be stressful.\n\nThen, when he finally asked for the formula, there was a communication issue. He was asking about the amount left, and she was trying to clarify, but he kept asking without understanding the process. This back-and-forth could have been frustrating. She might have felt that her time was being invaded again after she had already given in to help with the formula. The fact that she was explicit about wanting to relax after dinner could mean that his request was an unexpected interruption, leading to her outburst.\n\nNow, considering the husband's perspective, he might feel that he's just trying to get things done and that she's overreacting. But given the context of the prior interruptions and the accumulated stress, her reaction might be seen as a result of being overwhelmed. However, yelling at him in front of the baby could be seen as a harsh response, even if justified. It's possible that she's in the right for feeling wronged by the broken agreement and the interruptions, but maybe could have handled it more calmly. Alternatively, the husband isn't following through with his agreed-upon responsibilities, leading to her frustration.\n\nI think the key points are the broken agreement and the lack of respect for her time. She was clear about wanting uninterrupted time, which he kept interrupting. His asking for help with the baby might be necessary, but the way he approached it after their prior discussions might be the issue. The author's yelling was a reaction to multiple stressors, but it's a valid emotional response. However, yelling in front of the baby might not be the best approach. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but maybe the husband isn't either. But according to the question, we need to decide if she's in the wrong. Given that she was clear about her needs and he didn't respect them, her reaction, while possibly harsh, might be understandable. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
