My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the context: The author had a busy day at work and went to the gym. They agreed with their husband that after the author got home from the gym, he would run an errand to buy a travel bassinet. Instead, the husband started asking about the bassinet and other tasks. The author was hungry and wanted to eat and watch a show. They finally asked about the errand, and the husband wanted to clarify more. They did the finances, and the author thought they were done. Then, five minutes into the show, the husband asked for help with the baby's formula. The author got frustrated and yelled.\n\nSo, the main points here: The husband didn't follow through on their agreement. The author had made it clear they needed alone time after a long day. The husband kept interrupting with tasks. The final straw was the formula request during dinner. The author yelled, and the husband thinks they were wrong to do so.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The husband didn't stick to the agreed plan. The author had communicated their needs clearly before starting dinner. The interruptions were about tasks the husband should have handled himself, like the errand. The final request was unexpected and added to the stress. The husband scolded the author for yelling in front of the baby, but the author felt justified given the prior build-up.\n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about whether the person's reaction was reasonable given the circumstances. The author had a right to want rest after a long day. The husband didn't respect the boundaries by not doing his task and instead piling on more responsibilities. The yelling was a culmination of frustration from the day and the interruptions. So, the author isn't in the wrong because the husband didn't follow through on their agreement and kept adding tasks when the author wanted to relax. The husband's scolding seems to miss the underlying issues they caused.\n"
