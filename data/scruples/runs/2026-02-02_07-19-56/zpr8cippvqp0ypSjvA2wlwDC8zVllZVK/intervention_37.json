My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her husband for interrupting her dinner to help with the baby. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a busy day with work and the gym. They picked up their 4-month-old baby from daycare. The husband was supposed to run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she left for the gym. Instead, he stayed and asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks. She was tired and wanted to eat and relax. When she finally started her dinner and show, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby, leading to a disagreement where she ended up yelling.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations set by the couple. They agreed that after she got home from the gym, he would go out to run the errand. However, he didn't follow through and instead asked her to help with tasks. She felt this was an interruption after she was clear about needing alone time. Then, when she started her dinner, the interruption happened again with the formula issue, which escalated her frustration.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he wasn't in the wrong. He might have thought he was handling the tasks as needed, or maybe he believed that some coordination was necessary with her input. The author felt that her boundaries were crossed, leading to her outburst. \n\nNow, considering if the author is at fault. Arguments can be made both ways. On one hand, she had communicated her need for space and was clear about wanting to relax after a long day. The husband not adhering to that agreement could be seen as the initial problem. On the other hand, when he asked for help with the baby, which is a critical task, she might have been expected to assist, even if it was inconvenient. \n\nBut the escalation happened because he kept asking confusing questions about the formula, which she was trying to resolve but he kept pressing. She got frustrated and yelled. Yelling in front of a baby might be seen as harsh, even if she was upset. However, the husband did not follow through on his agreed task, which could have contributed to her frustration. \n\nThe husband's responsibility to take care of the errand as agreed might have been his mistake. The author's reaction was a result of his not sticking to their plan and then interrupting her. However, yelling, especially at a volume where the baby could hear, might be considered over the top, regardless of the reason. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, she did express her needs, but perhaps didn't manage the situation calmly when the interruption occurred. The husband might have felt that the situation demanded his attention, but he should have considered her need for downtime. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the husband's actions were inconsiderate or if the author overreacted. The fact that the husband didn't do what they agreed on (run the errand) is a point against him. The author's yelling is a response to his inconsiderate behavior, but yelling might be seen as her being in the wrong. However, given that the husband didn't follow the plan, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband didn't adhere to the agreed responsibilities, leading to her frustration. However, some might argue that yelling is never appropriate. But considering the context, the husband's actions contributed to the situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
