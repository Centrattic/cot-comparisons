My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author had a busy day with work and the gym. They had an agreement that after their workout, the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet). But instead, he asked her questions about the bassinet, did household tasks, and then interrupted her dinner with the baby. The author was trying to relax and had clearly communicated that she wanted to eat and watch a show without interruptions. When the husband kept interrupting, especially about the formula, she yelled at him. The husband thinks she was unjustified and scolded her for yelling in front of the baby.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author had a long day and was trying to have some downtime. She made her needs clear to her husband. The husband didn't follow through on his part of the agreement, instead taking on tasks that should have been his responsibility, thereby interrupting her. The argument escalated when he kept asking about the formula, leading to her yelling. \n\nFrom a typical perspective, when someone has communicated their need for rest and personal time, and the other person repeatedly interrupts despite being told they need space, it's understandable that they might become frustrated. Especially since they had an agreement. The husband not only didn't adhere to the agreement but also brought up additional tasks. The formula situation seems like a minor conflict that became a straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nHowever, yelling, especially in front of a baby, is not ideal. It can be seen as an overreaction, regardless of the provocation. The husband might feel that there were better ways to handle the situation without raising her voice. But given the context of accumulated stress and broken agreements, it's a common human reaction. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person's right to feel overwhelmed and have boundaries is acknowledged, even if the response (like yelling) isn't perfect. The husband's part in not following through and the interruptions likely contributed significantly to the situation. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer is probably B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
