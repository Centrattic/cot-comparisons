My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (her) is in the wrong when she yelled at her husband. The situation involves her being tired after a long day, wanting to relax, and her husband interrupting her dinner to ask for help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She had a busy day with work and the gym, and they had agreed that her husband would handle an important errand. Instead of doing that, he asked her questions and wanted help with other tasks. She finally got to eat and relax, but then he asked her to warm up the formula. The back-and-forth about the amount in the bottle frustrated her, leading her to yell.\n\nHer husband thinks she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby. So, the key points here are about boundaries, communication, and mutual understanding. They had a prior agreement, but he didn't follow through, which might have contributed to her frustration. She felt she had made it clear she wanted to relax, yet he still interrupted.\n\nIs yelling justified? Well, she was clearly exhausted and wanted some downtime after a hectic day. The interruption came when she was trying to enjoy a rare moment of relaxation. Her husband's actions broke their agreement and added unexpected tasks. However, yelling, especially in front of the baby, could be seen as inappropriate regardless of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, her husband was trying to manage baby needs, which are urgent. Maybe he didn't realize how important her alone time was. There's also the aspect of communication\u2014perhaps they didn't set clear expectations about what would happen after the gym. She could have asked him to handle the baby task himself if it was so frustrating, but instead, she took on the formula task, which led to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of fault, both might have some responsibility. She could have expressed her needs more calmly, and he might have respected her boundaries better. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she was trying to communicate her needs (asking if there was anything else) and he still interrupted, her frustration is understandable. However, yelling isn't ideal. Still, considering the circumstances, maybe she's not entirely wrong. So, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance here. The key is whether her actions were unjustified. Since the husband didn't hold up their agreement and kept interrupting despite her clear communication, the author's reaction, while not perfect, might be justified. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
