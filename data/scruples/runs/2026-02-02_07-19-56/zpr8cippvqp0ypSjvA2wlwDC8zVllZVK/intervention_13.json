My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, the context: She had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, picked up the baby from daycare. They had agreed that after she left for the gym, he would run an important errand (buying a travel bassinet). She was looking forward to alone time to eat and watch a show. Instead of leaving, he asked her questions about the bassinet and other chores. She got irritated but tried to handle it by asking when he was going. They discussed finances, then she told him she was tired and wanted to eat. Five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula, leading to a back-and-forth about the amount, which escalated to her yelling.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. They had an agreement, but he didn't stick to it. She felt interrupted in her rare downtime. He didn't follow through on his task and instead involved her in other tasks. The interruption about the baby formula happened without prior agreement, disrupting her time. She felt her boundaries were crossed when he kept asking about the formula amount despite her being clear about wanting to eat. Her yelling was a reaction to what she perceived as a breach of her needs for rest. However, yelling at him in front of the baby might not have been the best approach, but the situation seems to have built up from multiple interruptions and unmet expectations. The husband's actions (not following the agreement, interrupting her time) contributed to the conflict. So, while her reaction was intense, the root cause might be on both sides. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she tried to communicate her needs and he ignored them, leading to her outburst, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in terms of right or wrong, she might not be in the wrong because she was trying to assert her boundaries after prior issues. The answer is B (No).\n"
