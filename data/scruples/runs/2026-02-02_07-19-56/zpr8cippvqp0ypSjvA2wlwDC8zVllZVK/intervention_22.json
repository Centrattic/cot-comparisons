My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife yells at her husband when he interrupts her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The wife had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to alone time to relax, eat, and watch a show. They had agreed that after she returned from the gym, the husband would take care of an errand (buying a travel bassinet). However, he didn't leave immediately and instead asked her about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting irritated, but tried to be patient. She even offered to help with whatever he needed before eating. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up some formula. There was confusion about the amount left, which led to a back-and-forth, and she eventually lost her temper and yelled.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife had a valid need for rest and time to herself after a busy day. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement to handle the errand, instead involving her in other tasks. This led to her frustration. When he interrupted her during her limited alone time, even if the request was about the baby, she felt justified in her outburst.\n\nNow, considering if she's at fault. Yelling is a strong reaction, and it's important to manage emotions, especially in front of a baby. However, the husband didn't adhere to the earlier agreement, and the interruptions might have been preventable. The wife's frustration stems from unmet expectations and a need for self-care. While yelling isn't ideal, the root cause might lie in the husband's actions. The question is whether she's in the wrong for yelling, given the circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, she could have handled it more calmly. On the other, the husband's behavior contributed to the situation. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong (as per their initial thought), but the analysis shows mutual responsibility, the answer might depend on whether the husband's actions were more to blame. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongness. If the husband did break their agreement and kept interrupting despite her clear communication, maybe she's not entirely at fault. But yelling could still be an issue regardless.\n"
