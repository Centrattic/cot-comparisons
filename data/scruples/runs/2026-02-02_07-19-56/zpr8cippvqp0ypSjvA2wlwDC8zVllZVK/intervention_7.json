My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to ask for help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The author had a busy day, including work and the gym. They had an agreement that the husband would run an errand after she got home from the gym. Instead, he started asking her questions and doing household tasks. She felt frustrated, wanted alone time, and eventually yelled when he interrupted her again to feed the baby.\n\nSo, the key points here are the expectations and communication. The couple agreed on a plan, but the husband didn't follow through. The author was tired and looked forward to some downtime. When he kept interrupting, she got upset. The final straw was when he couldn't decide how much formula to warm up, leading her to lose her temper.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. On one hand, she had communicated her need to relax and asked if there was anything else before starting dinner. The husband might have thought he needed her help or perhaps misunderstood the urgency of the errand. On the other hand, yelling in front of the baby and not respecting his need for assistance could be seen as overreacting. The husband's actions might have been necessary for the baby, so her reaction might be too harsh despite the prior agreement.\n\nBut also, maybe the husband should have considered her need for rest after a long day. The communication seems to have broken down. She was clear about not wanting interruptions, but he still asked for help. However, the baby's needs are immediate, so there's a balance between respecting her time and attending to the child.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about mutual responsibility. If the husband didn't stick to the agreement and kept asking for help despite her being clear, that's part of the problem. But the author's response of yelling might be excessive. The situation is a bit of a gray area. The husband's actions could have been better planned, but the author's reaction was also a bit extreme. However, given that she had communicated her needs and the husband still interrupted, maybe the husband is more at fault here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she did yell, even if provoked, that might tip the scales towards her being at fault. But maybe not entirely. It's a tricky balance.\n"
