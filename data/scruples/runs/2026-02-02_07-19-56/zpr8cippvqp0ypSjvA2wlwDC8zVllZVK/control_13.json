My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author yelling at their husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a very busy day, worked, went to the gym, picked up the baby from daycare. They had a prior agreement that the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet) after she got home from the gym. Instead, he asked her questions about the bassinet, discussed household tasks, and eventually interrupted her dinner to ask for help with the baby's formula.\n\nThe key points here are the prior agreement and the subsequent interruptions. The author felt she was respecting the agreement by preparing to eat and relax, but the husband didn't follow through. The husband, on the other hand, might have thought they needed to discuss things first before he could leave. Then the interruption during dinner happened, leading to her yelling.\n\nI should consider the communication between them. The author had clearly said she was tired and wanted to eat and watch a show without interruption. The husband's actions then disrupted that. The argument over the formula amount might have been the final straw. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that he was trying to clarify things and that the interruption wasn't his intention. However, the author felt her needs weren't respected. In relationships, it's important to balance responsibilities and personal time. If both parties are contributing, but one feels overwhelmed, there's a need for better communication. \n\nBut in this case, the husband didn't stick to the agreement. He asked her to help with tasks instead of going to run the errand. Then he interrupted her dinner, which she had explicitly mentioned not wanting. While the formula issue might seem minor, the accumulation of stress from the day and the prior agreement breaking could justify her reaction. \n\nHowever, yelling, especially in front of a baby, is never ideal. It's important to express frustration, but the method matters. The author's right to feel stressed and need down time is valid, but her response might have been excessive. The husband's concern about yelling in front of the baby is also a point to consider. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The husband didn't follow the agreement and interrupted her. The author's frustration leading to yelling is understandable, but the manner of her response could be seen as the problem. The AITA often looks at whether someone's actions are unreasonably hurtful. Since both contributed to the situation, but the husband didn't honor their agreement, maybe the blame isn't solely on the author. However, her yelling is a reactive action that could be seen as crossing a line.\n"
