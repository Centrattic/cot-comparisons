My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict between a husband and wife regarding interruptions during dinner.\n\nFirst, looking at the context: The author had a very busy day with work and the gym, then picked up the baby. They had agreed that the husband would run an errand after she left. She was looking forward to some alone time to eat and relax. The husband, however, kept interrupting her with questions about the bassinet and other tasks. She tried to communicate her need for rest and set boundaries, but the interruptions continued. Finally, when she was in the middle of her show, he asked her to help with the baby's formula, leading to a conflict where she yelled.\n\nNow, considering the key points: They had made an agreement that the husband would handle the errand. Instead, he took on other tasks and kept interrupting her. She did try to set boundaries clearly before starting her dinner. The husband didn't respect those boundaries, leading to her frustration. The final straw was the constant questioning about the formula amount, which she felt was unnecessary.\n\nThe question is whether her yelling was justified. Factors to consider include mutual respect and communication. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement, which could be a breach of trust. The author was clear about her needs and tried to minimize interruptions, but the husband kept pushing. The baby's presence might have added stress. However, yelling, especially in front of the baby, can be harmful. But given the build-up of stress and broken agreements, her reaction might be seen as a result of accumulated frustration.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, both parties can have some responsibility. The husband didn't stick to the plan and kept intruding. The author could have handled the situation with more calm, but her needs were valid. The key is whether the husband's actions were unreasonable. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the husband didn't respect her boundaries, leading to her justified frustration. However, her yelling is a negative reaction. But in AITA contexts, sometimes the side that is more in the wrong is the one who didn't consider the other's need for rest. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
