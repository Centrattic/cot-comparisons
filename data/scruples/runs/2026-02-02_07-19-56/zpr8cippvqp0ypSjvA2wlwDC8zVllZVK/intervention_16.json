My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife with a 4-month-old baby. The wife had a busy day at work and the gym, then picked up their baby from daycare. They had agreed that after she returned from the gym, her husband would run an important errand (buying a travel bassinet) so she could have alone time to relax, eat dinner, and watch a show.\n\nSo, the husband didn't go as agreed. Instead, he asked her questions about the bassinet and other household tasks. She became irritated, and after they handled the finance stuff, she started her meal and show. Five minutes in, he asked her to warm up the formula, leading to a back-and-forth that escalated into her yelling at him. Now, he thinks she was wrong to get upset and yell in front of the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife had a hectic day and was looking forward to some downtime. She made it clear she wanted to not be interrupted. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement, which is a breach of trust. He instead used her time to discuss other tasks, which added to her stress. Then, when she was finally trying to relax, he interrupted again with a task that required her to measure the formula, leading to confusion and frustration.\n\nBut maybe the husband had a reason for not going immediately. Perhaps the questions were important for the purchase, or maybe there was a misunderstanding. However, the key points here are the prior agreement and the interruption. The wife felt her needs for rest and alone time were being disregarded. The husband, on the other hand, might feel that his needs (like handling the baby's feeding) are important and that she's being too rigid.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the wife set clear boundaries and the husband didn't respect them. However, the husband might have felt that the tasks were necessary. But the escalation came when he interrupted her during her designated downtime. The yelling in front of the baby is a point against her, as it could be traumatic. However, the context of her exhaustion and the broken agreement could mitigate that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But from the story, the wife had communicated her needs clearly and the husband didn't honor them. The interruption was after she had tried to make it clear she wanted to relax. So maybe the husband is at fault for not respecting her boundaries, but the wife's response was excessive. However, the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. If the husband didn't follow the agreement and then interrupted her, she's within her rights to be upset. But yelling might not be the best approach, even if justified.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who breaks agreements or disregards the other's needs is considered more at fault. So maybe the husband is more at fault here for not sticking to the plan and interrupting. The wife's reaction is understandable given her stress, but the yelling is problematic. However, considering the context of her exhaustion and the broken agreement, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the husband's actions were the root cause.\n"
