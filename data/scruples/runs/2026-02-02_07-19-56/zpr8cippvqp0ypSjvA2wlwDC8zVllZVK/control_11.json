My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman who had a busy day, went to the gym, and wanted some alone time to eat and relax. Her husband, instead of running the errand they agreed upon, kept asking questions about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting irritated and finally asked when he was leaving. He waited to clarify things, then after she started her dinner, he interrupted five minutes in to ask her to warm up formula for the baby. They had a back-and-forth about the amount, which got frustrating, leading her to yell and scream.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their agreement. They had a plan: after she came home from the gym, he would run the errand. He didn't follow through, which already set a precedent for her irritation. She tried to set boundaries, asking if there was anything else he needed before she started her dinner. He said no, so she went ahead. The interruption happened five minutes into her alone time, which might be a trigger point after a long, exhausting day.\n\nThe key points here are communication breakdown and unmet expectations. The husband didn't stick to their initial agreement, which led to her frustration. The interruption during her time to relax was unexpected. The fact that he kept asking about the formula amount, which wasn't clear without measuring, added to her stress. Her reaction was a culmination of being overworked and not having her boundaries respected. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that he was trying to be helpful by clarifying things and that the formula situation wasn't her fault. However, she had clearly communicated her need for alone time. The fact that he didn't leave as agreed first is a major point. Yelling might not be ideal, but given the context of her exhaustion and the interruptions, her reaction is understandable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who had a valid reason and if there's a pattern of behavior. Here, the husband didn't follow through on the initial agreement, leading to her stress. Her yelling was a result of being pushed past her limit after a day of non-stop activity. The baby being present is a consideration, but the main issue is mutual communication and respect for each other's needs. The husband's scolding might be seen as dismissive of her valid feelings. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She had valid reasons for her reaction, and the husband didn't adhere to the initial plan, contributing to the conflict. The answer is B.\n"
