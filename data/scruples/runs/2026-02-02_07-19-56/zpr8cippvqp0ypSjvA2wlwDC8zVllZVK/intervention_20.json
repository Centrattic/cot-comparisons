My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife with a baby, and the wife is upset because the husband interrupted her dinner to ask for help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The wife had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time. They had agreed that after she returned from the gym, the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet) while she had dinner. But instead, he asked her lots of questions about the bassinet and other household tasks. She was getting irritated, but they eventually dealt with some stuff, and she started eating and watching a show. Then, five minutes in, he asked her to warm up formula. There was confusion about how much to warm, leading to an argument where she yelled at him.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and mutual respect. The wife had clearly communicated her need for alone time and asked if there was anything else, and he said no. Then he interrupted her, which she found disrespectful. The husband thought she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The wife had a right to her alone time, especially after a long day. However, the baby's needs might be urgent. The husband might have thought he needed her help. But the problem was the interruption and the back-and-forth about the formula. The wife did ask for clarification multiple times, but maybe the husband should have handled it himself or waited. However, the wife's reaction was yelling, which could be seen as excessive, especially with the baby present.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband didn't follow through on their agreement to run the errand, which added to the frustration. The author might feel justified in her anger because the husband didn't respect her boundaries. But yelling in front of the baby could be seen as inappropriate. So, there's a balance here. The husband didn't respect her time, but the wife's reaction was harsh. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The husband didn't honor their agreement and interrupted her, but the wife's response was yelling. So maybe the wife is partially at fault. However, if the husband had followed the original plan, there wouldn't be an issue. The confusion about the formula might have been a minor issue that escalated due to prior frustration. \n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband broke their agreement and interrupted, maybe the wife isn't entirely at fault. But yelling is a strong reaction. Maybe both have some responsibility. However, the answer needs to be A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the community might differ. \n\nI think the answer is a nuanced one, but since the user is asking for a choice between A and B, and considering that the husband didn't follow through on their agreement and the interruption was the straw that broke the camel's back, the wife's reaction, while harsh, might be understandable. However, yelling in front of the baby is a red flag. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A) for yelling, even if the husband was disrespectful. Alternatively, the husband's actions led to it, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong (B). \n\nGiven the scenario, I think the author is not in the wrong because the husband didn't respect the boundaries first. So answer B.\n"
