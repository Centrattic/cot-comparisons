My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author had a very busy day, working and going to the gym. They had an agreement with their husband that after the author got home from the gym, the husband would take care of buying a travel bassinet for their 4-month-old baby. Instead, the husband stayed home, asked the author questions about the bassinet and other tasks, which the author found irritating. The author wanted to relax, eat dinner, and watch a show they don't enjoy. They asked the husband if there was anything else to do, and he said no. After five minutes, the husband asked for help feeding the baby with formula, leading to a back-and-forth about how much formula was left. The author got frustrated and yelled.\n\nSo, the main points here are about boundaries, communication, and expectations. The author felt they had communicated clearly that they needed time to themselves after a long day. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement, which made the author upset. The husband then interrupted again with the formula, leading to the outburst.\n\nFirst, the agreement: The husband was supposed to leave to get the bassinet. He didn't, which already violated the plan. The author was clear about needing time to relax. Then, when he asked about the formula, there was confusion, and the author's frustration boiled over. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did tell their husband to leave, and he didn't. The author also had a legitimate need for rest after a long day. However, the way they reacted was yelling, which can be harmful, especially in front of the baby. The husband might feel that while he made a mistake, the author's reaction was excessive. \n\nBut considering the context: the author was exhausted, had communicated their needs, and the husband didn't respect that. The back-and-forth about the formula added to the stress. Yelling in frustration is understandable, but it's not ideal. However, the initial agreement wasn't honored, which might justify the frustration. \n\nSo, does the author deserve blame? Maybe partially for yelling, but the husband also didn't follow through on their plan. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The story is framed as \"AITA?\" but the answer depends on who made more mistakes. The husband didn't keep his part of the agreement and then caused more stress. The author's frustration is valid, but the yelling could be seen as misplaced. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for yelling, but the husband is also at fault for not respecting the agreement. However, in these situations, people often focus on the person who escalated the conflict. Since the author was the one who ended up yelling, they might be seen as more at fault. But considering the context of their exhaustion and the husband's initial failure, maybe not entirely. It's a bit of both, but in the AITA framework, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they lost their temper. But I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
