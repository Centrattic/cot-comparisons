My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had a very busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some downtime. She and her husband had agreed that he would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she got home from the gym. Instead, he started asking her about the bassinet and other tasks like balancing finances. She was getting irritated and eventually told him she was tired and wanted to eat and relax. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula, leading to a back-and-forth about the amount, which escalated into her yelling.\n\nSo, the main points here are: prior agreement about responsibilities, the husband not following through on his part, the author feeling overwhelmed and needing rest, and the interruption during her time to relax. The husband thinks she's overreacting, especially since she yelled in front of the baby.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the narrative, she had communicated her need for alone time and was clear that she wanted to start eating and relaxing. The husband then interrupted her during that time to ask for help with the baby. The back-and-forth about the formula might have been confusing, but the key issue is the interruption of her downtime. \n\nIn terms of communication, she had set boundaries and he didn't respect them. Yelling might be considered an overreaction, but it's a result of accumulated stress and broken agreements. The husband's actions (not completing his task, interrupting her, and then the formula confusion) contributed to her outburst. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling at someone in front of a baby isn't ideal, and mutual respect is important. However, the root cause here seems to be about unmet expectations and lack of follow-through on the husband's part. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's reaction was a result of being stressed and having her boundaries ignored. While yelling isn't the best approach, the husband's actions likely played a role in triggering it. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the husband didn't adhere to their agreement and interrupted her rest time, leading to her frustration.\n"
