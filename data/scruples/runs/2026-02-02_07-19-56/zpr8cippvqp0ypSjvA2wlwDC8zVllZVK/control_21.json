My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who yells at their husband after he interrupts their dinner to ask for help with the baby. Let me break down the context step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a very busy day, including work and the gym. They picked up their 4-month-old baby from daycare on their way home from work. They had an agreement that after the author comes back from the gym, the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) ASAP. Instead, the husband stayed and asked the author to help with questions about the bassinet and other tasks like balancing finances. The author was getting irritated because they were hungry and wanted some alone time to relax and watch a show they don't share with the husband.\n\nThen, five minutes into the show, the husband asks the author to warm up the rest of the formula from a partially used bottle. There's confusion about how much is left, leading to back-and-forth between them. The author ends up yelling because they felt interrupted and the husband wasn't respecting their request to not be disturbed during dinner.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are the agreement between the couple, the husband not following through with his part of the deal, and the subsequent interruption during the author's downtime. The author had clearly communicated their need for rest and relaxation after a long day, even offering to help with tasks beforehand. The husband's interruption after that agreement might be the main issue here.\n\nThe husband's actions of not sticking to the agreement and then asking for help again when the author was trying to relax could be seen as a breach of trust or lack of respect for boundaries. The author's frustration seems justified given their prior communication and the husband's failure to adhere to their agreed-upon responsibilities. However, yelling and scolding in front of the baby could have negative effects, so even if the frustration is valid, the manner in which it was expressed might be problematic.\n\nBut in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author's actions were unjustified. The husband didn't follow through on his responsibility, leading to the author's irritation. The interruption during dinner, after the author had made their needs clear, could be the catalyst for the yelling. So, while the author's response was emotional and might not be the best way to handle it, the root cause is the husband's actions. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because their initial agreement wasn't respected, and they had valid reasons for their frustration. However, the yelling part might make others think the author is at fault. It's a bit of a tricky balance between valid frustration and appropriate response. But given that the husband didn't follow the agreement and the situation was already tense, the author's actions could be seen as a reaction to being disrespected, which might not make them entirely wrong. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
