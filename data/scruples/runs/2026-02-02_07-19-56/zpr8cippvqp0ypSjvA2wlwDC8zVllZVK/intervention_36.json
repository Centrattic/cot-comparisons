My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife dealing with household responsibilities and a baby.\n\nFirst, the wife had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time. She expected her husband to take care of the travel bassinet purchase as agreed. Instead, he kept asking her questions and involving her in other tasks. She was tired and wanted to eat and watch TV without interruptions. The husband then asked her to warm up the baby's formula, which led to a conflict because the amount wasn't clear. The wife ended up yelling at him.\n\nI need to analyze both sides. The wife had made it clear she wanted to relax after a long day. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement, which might have contributed to her frustration. However, the baby's needs are important, and the husband might have thought it necessary to ask for help. The wife's response was yelling, which can be seen as excessive, even if she was stressed. Yelling in front of the baby could be a factor the husband is concerned about. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife had the right to set boundaries. If the husband agreed to take care of the errand, he should have done so without expecting her to handle other tasks. The constant interruptions might have been the real issue, leading to her outburst. The husband, however, might not have realized the impact of his actions on her stress levels. \n\nConsidering communication and mutual respect, both could have handled the situation better. But the key point is whether the wife was in the wrong for yelling. While her frustration is understandable, yelling isn't the best way to handle stress, especially with a baby around. However, the husband not honoring their agreement and interrupting her alone time also plays a role. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on who overstepped. The wife's yelling might be the main issue here, but the husband's failure to follow through and the lack of communication could mitigate her responsibility. Still, she had a choice in how she reacted. So maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and her yelling is the main point of contention, I'll go with A.\n"
