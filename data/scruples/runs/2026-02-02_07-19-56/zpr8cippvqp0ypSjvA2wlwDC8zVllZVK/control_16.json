My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves a husband and wife with a baby. The wife had a busy day, including work and the gym, and wanted some downtime. They had an agreement that the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she got home from the gym. Instead, he started asking about the purchase and other tasks, which annoyed her. She tried to set boundaries, but when he interrupted her dinner to feed the baby, she lost her temper and yelled at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreements they had. She left the gym expecting the husband to handle the errand, but he didn't. Instead, he took up her time with questions and tasks. She was clear about needing time to herself, which is important. The husband didn't respect her boundaries by interrupting her dinner to ask for help with the baby, even after she had set the expectation beforehand. \n\nThe argument here is about communication and respect for each other's needs. The wife was stressed and needed downtime, which is reasonable. The husband not sticking to their agreement and then interrupting her could be seen as the root of the problem. However, she did yell, which might be an overreaction even if justified. But given the context of her exhaustion and the husband not following through on his part, her frustration is understandable.\n\nThe key points are: the husband broke their agreement, she communicated her needs, and he still interrupted. The yelling was a result of accumulated stress and broken boundaries. While yelling isn't ideal, the situation shows a pattern of the husband not respecting her time. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the husband had a reason for not going to the errand? The scenario doesn't mention that. Also, she did offer to help with other tasks before, but he still asked for more. The back-and-forth about the formula might have escalated things, but the main issue was the initial interruption. I think the blame is on the husband for not respecting the agreement and her boundaries, so the wife isn't in the wrong.\n"
