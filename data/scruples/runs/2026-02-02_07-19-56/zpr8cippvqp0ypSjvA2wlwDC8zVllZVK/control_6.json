My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who is the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, the context: She had a busy day at work and the gym, then drove home, expecting alone time to eat and relax. They had agreed he would run the errand for the bassinet. But he didn't go, instead asked her questions about the purchase and other tasks. She got irritated, but eventually they handled the finances, and she started eating and watching a show. Five minutes in, he asked her to warm up the remaining formula. There was confusion about how much to warm, leading to an argument and her yelling. He thinks she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. She had a valid reason to be tired and wanted alone time. They had a prior agreement, so he didn't do what he was supposed to. Then he interrupts her during a rare moment of rest with a task that's unclear. The back and forth about the formula amount might have escalated her frustration. However, yelling and raising her voice in front of the baby could be seen as harsh, even if she was upset. The husband's perspective is that he was trying to get the task done and she overreacted. \n\nBut the key points are the prior agreement and the interruption. If he broke the agreement by not going to get the bassinet and then added more tasks, that's a breach. The baby situation might be urgent, but the way he handled it could have been better. She was clear about her need for rest, and he didn't respect that. The yelling could be a justified reaction to being interrupted after a long day. However, the method of handling it\u2014yelling\u2014might not be the healthiest, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), because she had a valid reason to be upset and the husband didn't follow through on their agreement. The yelling is a reaction to unmet expectations and stress, so she's not entirely at fault.\n"
