My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife is upset because her husband interrupted her dinner to ask for help with the baby. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some downtime. They had an agreement that after she got home from the gym, the husband would run an errand. Instead, he started asking about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting irritated, so she clarified if he was done. He said no, then she prepared to eat. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to help with the baby's formula again, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the prearranged plan and the interruption. The wife had communicated her needs clearly: she wanted to relax after a long day. The husband, however, didn't stick to the agreement and kept adding tasks. The interruption during dinner, especially after she had already set up her meal and show, seems to be the trigger. The back-and-forth about the formula might have been frustrating, especially if the husband wasn't clear.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he's trying to get things done, but the wife's frustration comes from feeling disrespected and not being allowed to have her time. The wife's yelling is a reaction to being interrupted and not being given space after a long day. While yelling isn't ideal, especially in front of the baby, the underlying issue is about boundaries and agreed-upon responsibilities. The husband didn't honor the agreement and interrupted her time, which could justify her reaction. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
