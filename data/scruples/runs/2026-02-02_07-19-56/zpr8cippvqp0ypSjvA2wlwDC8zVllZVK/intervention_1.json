My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about a husband and wife dealing with childcare and household responsibilities. The author, who's the wife in this case, had a long day, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time to eat and relax. They had agreed that the husband would run an errand for the baby, but he ended up asking her questions and doing tasks instead, which upset her. Then when she was finally trying to relax, he interrupted her to warm up formula, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife had a busy day and was clearly exhausted. She communicated her needs to the husband, asking him to go get the bassinet as agreed and then later, after handling some tasks, she emphasized she wanted to eat and relax without interruption. The husband, on the other hand, didn't stick to the agreement and instead took on other tasks, which might have been due to his own priorities or perhaps not seeing the importance of her downtime. \n\nBut when the husband asked for help feeding the baby, even after she stated she didn't want interruptions, that's where the conflict escalated. The wife then yelled at him. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The husband might have thought he was helping, but he didn't respect her boundaries. However, the wife's reaction was yelling, which can be seen as excessive, especially in front of the baby. \n\nThe husband's perspective might be that he was trying to manage tasks and needed help with the baby, but he didn't realize how important her alone time was. The wife felt her needs weren't respected, leading to frustration. The question is whether yelling was justified. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband didn't follow through on the agreed task and then interrupted her. The wife's response was a reaction to being disrupted after setting clear boundaries. However, yelling can be seen as a poor coping mechanism, regardless of the situation. So maybe the author is partially at fault for her reaction, even if the husband didn't respect her boundaries. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, so maybe they see the husband's actions as minor compared to the wife's yelling. Alternatively, others might argue that she was within her right to express frustration after being stressed all day. It's hard to say definitively, but considering that the husband didn't adhere to the agreement and then interrupted her, the wife's frustration is understandable. However, yelling in front of the baby and the manner of her response could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, I think the author is partially at fault, but maybe not entirely. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the husband also didn't follow through on his responsibilities and the interruption came after she had communicated her needs, perhaps the fault isn't entirely hers. However, her reaction was yelling, which is a strong response. So overall, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though there were contributing factors, her response was inappropriate. Alternatively, it could be B (No) since the husband didn't respect her boundaries. Hmm. I need to decide based on the situation. The user initially thinks the author is wrong, but others might see it differently. The key is whether the husband's actions justified the yelling. Since he did interrupt after she had clearly stated her need for alone time, maybe the author's frustration is valid, but the yelling was unhelpful. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she overreacted, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, B (No) because the husband was at fault for not respecting her wishes. I'm a bit torn here. The user's original thought is A, but maybe the correct answer is B. Wait, the user says \"AITA\" and the person wants to know if they're in the wrong. The community often considers mutual responsibility. In this case, the husband didn't follow through on the agreement, leading to the wife's stress. Then he interrupts her again. She's justified in being frustrated, but yelling isn't the best way. However, in the AITA context, sometimes people are considered in the wrong if their reaction is disproportionate. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% certain. I think the correct answer here is A because even though the husband made mistakes, the author's yelling was an overreaction. So I'll go with A.\n"
