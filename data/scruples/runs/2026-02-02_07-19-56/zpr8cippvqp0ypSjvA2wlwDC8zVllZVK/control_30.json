My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple dealing with post-work exhaustion and responsibilities related to their 4-month-old baby.\n\nFirst, the author had a busy day with work and the gym. They had an agreement that the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet) after she got home. Instead, he asked her questions and handled other tasks, which disrupted her alone time. When she finally started her dinner and show, he interrupted to ask for help with the baby's formula.\n\nThe key points here are the prior agreement and the interruption. The author felt she had communicated her need for rest and her expectations. The husband didn't follow through on his part of the deal, leading to frustration. When he interrupted during dinner, her stress levels were high, leading to an outburst.\n\nNow, considering the husband's perspective: he might feel that the baby's needs are urgent and that teamwork is required. However, the author had clearly stated her boundaries, and the husband didn't respect them initially. The interruption during her time to unwind was a trigger for her reaction.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author had the right to set boundaries after a long day. The husband, while trying to manage household tasks, didn't honor the agreed-upon responsibilities. His interruption was a breach of that agreement. The author's yelling was a result of accumulated stress and broken boundaries. However, yelling, especially in front of the baby, is not ideal. But given the circumstances, her frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, while the author isn't without fault (yelling isn't constructive), the husband didn't respect her needs first. The primary responsibility here might lie more with the husband for not adhering to the agreement. The answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, though both could have handled it better.\n"
