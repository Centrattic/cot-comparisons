My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author had a very busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time to eat and relax. They had an agreement that after she left for the gym, the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet). Instead, he stayed and started asking her questions about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting tired and irritated, so she reminded him about the errand. He delayed to clarify some things, and she thought he was done after handling finances. Then she started eating and watching TV.\n\nThen, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up the baby's formula. The back-and-forth about the amount caused her to lose it and yell. The husband thinks she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she was clearly stressed and had been promised some time to herself. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement, which led to her frustration. When he then interrupted again with the baby's feeding, she snapped. Her reasoning is that she communicated her boundaries and was just trying to get some rest after a long day.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that he was trying to manage the baby's needs and that her reaction was excessive. He might also think he was doing what needed to be done for the baby, even if it interrupted her time.\n\nBut considering the buildup of stress, the broken agreement, and the fact that she did communicate her limits before starting to eat, it seems like she's justified in feeling upset. Yelling is not the best way to handle it, but the situation is stressful. The key points are that they had an agreement, he didn't stick to it, and she was trying to communicate her needs clearly. The interruption during her rare alone time probably pushed her over the edge. So, maybe she's not in the wrong, but they need to talk about communication and boundaries. The answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
