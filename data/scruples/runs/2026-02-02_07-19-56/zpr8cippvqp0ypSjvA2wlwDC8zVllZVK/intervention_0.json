My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong when they yelled at their husband for interrupting dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author had a busy day, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time to eat and watch a show. They had agreed with their husband that after her workout, he would run an important errand (buy a travel bassinet for their 4-month-old baby). But instead of leaving, he asked her about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting tired, so she asked when he was going, and he wanted to clarify things first. They sorted out finances, and she confirmed she was done. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula. There was confusion about the amount, and after some back and forth, she lost her temper and yelled.\n\nThe husband thinks she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points here are about expectations and communication. They had an agreement that he would leave to handle the errand after she got home from the gym. He didn't follow through, instead engaging her in discussions about other matters. She was clearly tired and wanted alone time. Then he interrupted again with the baby's feeding issue, which added to her frustration.\n\nBut wait, the baby is only 4 months old. Feeding the baby is a critical task. Even if they had an agreement, the baby's needs can't be ignored. So, maybe the husband had a valid reason to ask for help. However, the way he approached it might have been problematic. He could have waited until she was done eating, but the baby can't wait for food. On the other hand, she had already made it clear she was done and wanted to relax.\n\nThe confusion about the formula amount might have been avoidable if he had known how much was left. But maybe he was just trying to get the right amount for the baby. The back and forth could have been handled more calmly by both parties. The author's frustration is understandable given her exhaustion, but yelling in front of the baby is a red flag. Parents often try to model calm behavior for their children, so yelling can be harmful. However, the husband didn't follow through on their prior agreement, contributing to her stress. \n\nIs she in the wrong? She had valid reasons for being stressed. But yelling, especially in front of the baby, might be seen as inappropriate. However, the situation was stressful, and the husband didn't stick to their plan. It's a bit of a gray area. The husband's actions might have been necessary for the baby, but he could have communicated better. The author's expectations about alone time were reasonable, but she might have handled it better. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is that the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The husband didn't follow their agreement, leading to her frustration. However, her response of yelling was not ideal. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if the husband had a legitimate reason to ask for help with the baby, maybe she should have handled it more calmly. But given the setup, she had communicated her needs clearly, and he interrupted anyway. So, her reaction might be justified, even if yelling wasn't the best approach.\n"
