My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. So, I need to analyze the situation they described.\n\nFirst, the author had a very busy day with work, the gym, and picking up the baby. They had a plan that the husband would take care of the travel bassinet while she had some alone time to eat and relax. The husband didn't stick to the plan and instead asked her to help with multiple tasks, which she was already getting irritated about. Then, when she finally started her dinner and show, he interrupted to ask her to warm up the formula again, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author clearly communicated her need to have time to herself after a tiring day. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement and kept piling on tasks. The situation escalated when he kept asking about the formula, which she found annoying and intrusive. Her yelling was a reaction to being interrupted when she was trying to relax, which she had made clear earlier.\n\nNow, the husband's perspective is that he was trying to get things done and maybe didn't realize how much she was stressed. But she had set boundaries, and he broke them. Her response was emotional, which is understandable given the stress of the day and the repeated interruptions. However, yelling at him and in front of the baby might be seen as harsh, but the question is whether she was in the wrong. The husband's actions were the root cause of the conflict. She had a right to be upset about not being respected when she tried to set her boundaries. So while her reaction was intense, the husband's failure to honor their agreement and her boundaries is a significant factor. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
