My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me start by summarizing the key points.\n\nThe author had a very busy day at work and went to the gym. They had an agreement that after the gym, the husband would run an errand to buy a travel bassinet. However, the husband didn't leave and instead started asking questions and doing household tasks. The author was hungry and wanted to relax, so they asked when he was leaving. The husband insisted on clarifying some things, so they handled finances and then the author started eating and watching a show. Five minutes in, the husband asked the author to warm up the formula for the baby. The author tried to clarify the amount needed, but the husband kept asking for more details, leading to frustration. The author ended up yelling at him, and now the husband is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the agreement and whether it was honored. The author and husband had an agreement that the husband would take care of the errand after the author left for the gym. However, the husband didn't leave; instead, he engaged in other tasks. The author was clear about wanting to relax after a long day. The husband's interruption after five minutes of the author's alone time seems to be the catalyst for the argument.\n\nNext, the interaction about the formula. The husband's repeated questions about the amount left in the bottle could be seen as unnecessary, especially if the author had already clarified the need for 120mL. The husband's persistence might have been frustrating because the author was trying to minimize interruptions. However, the husband might have been trying to be precise with the baby's formula, which is important for the baby's health.\n\nThe author's response was to yell, which escalated the situation. While the husband did break the agreement, the author's reaction of screaming might have been excessive, especially considering the presence of the baby. Yelling in front of a child can be stressful and is generally not advisable. However, the author was under a lot of stress from the long day and the unmet expectations.\n\nThe husband's reaction is that he feels scolded for the yelling. He might believe he had a valid reason to ask for help with the baby, given that he was taking care of the errand. The author might feel that the husband didn't respect her need for downtime after a tiring schedule. \n\nFactors to consider: the breach of agreement by the husband, the author's stress and need for rest, the husband's potential good intentions in handling the baby's formula, and the appropriateness of the yelling. The key here is whether the husband's actions were reasonable in the context of caring for the baby versus the author's need for a break. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The author had a valid reason to be upset about the broken agreement and the interruption. However, responding with yelling is problematic, especially in front of the baby. The husband's need for help with the baby is a valid point, but he might have handled the request differently. \n\nOverall, the author's frustration is understandable, but the yelling is likely where they went wrong. The husband did not adhere to the agreement, but the author's response was excessive. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while the situation is stressful, yelling is not appropriate and the husband had a valid reason to need help with the baby.\n"
