My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author had a very busy day, including work and the gym. They had agreed that the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she got home from the gym. Instead of leaving, he asked her questions about the bassinet and other household tasks, which made her irritated. She tried to set boundaries by asking if he was done so she could eat and relax. \n\nThen, five minutes into her planned downtime, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby. There was some confusion about the amount in the bottle, leading to a back-and-forth that escalated. The author lost her temper, yelling at him in front of the baby. The husband thinks she was wrong to yell and scolded her for it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was exhausted after a long day, had communicated her need for uninterrupted time, and the husband didn't respect that. The interruption came at a moment when she was trying to relax. The argument over the formula might have been the last straw, but the root cause was the husband not adhering to their prior agreement and her boundaries. \n\nThe husband's actions might have contributed to her frustration. If they had agreed he would handle the errand, but he didn't leave, that's a breach of their agreement. His asking for help with the baby again after she had already set boundaries could be seen as not respecting her need for rest. \n\nHowever, yelling in front of the baby might be seen as an overreaction, but considering her stress and exhaustion, it's understandable. The question is whether she's in the wrong. In many cases, people might empathize with her situation, given the cumulative stress and the boundary issues. The husband's responsibility could also be in question for not following through with his part of the agreement and not respecting her time. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any point where the author overstepped. Yelling is a strong reaction, but given the context, it's a valid expression of frustration. The husband's actions contributed to the problem. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
