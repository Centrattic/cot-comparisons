My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author had a very busy day with work and the gym. They agreed that after she got home, her husband would run an errand to buy a travel bassinet. But instead, he started asking her questions about the purchase and took care of other tasks. She was clearly tired and wanted some alone time to eat and relax. When she finally started eating, he asked her to warm up the formula, leading to a confusing exchange about the amount left, which escalated into her yelling.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement and the interruptions. They had a plan, but he didn't stick to it, which probably added to her frustration. The author tried to set boundaries by asking if there was anything else, and he said no. Then, five minutes into her alone time, he interrupts again. The back-and-forth about the formula might have been the last straw.\n\nNow, the husband's perspective: he might feel that the baby's needs are urgent and that teamwork is necessary. However, the author had communicated her limits clearly. Yelling in front of the baby could be seen as harsh, but the context of stress and broken agreements might explain it. \n\nThe question is whether her reaction was justified. She was trying to set boundaries, and he kept interrupting despite her clear communication. The husband not honoring the agreed-upon tasks could be a significant factor. However, yelling, while understandable, might not be the best approach. But considering the circumstances, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nI need to weigh the communication breakdown and the stress of the day. The husband didn't follow through on his part, leading to the author's frustration. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she had a right to be upset about the broken agreement and the interruptions.\n"
