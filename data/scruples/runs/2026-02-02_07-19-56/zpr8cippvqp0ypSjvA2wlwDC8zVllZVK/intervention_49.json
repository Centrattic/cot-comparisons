My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the details.\n\nThe author is a woman who had a very busy day, including work and the gym. She and her husband had agreed that after she returned from the gym, he would run an important errand to buy a travel bassinet for their 4-month-old baby. She expected to have some alone time to relax, eat dinner, and watch a show (Archer) that her husband doesn't like. However, instead of leaving to do the errand, he stayed and asked her questions about the bassinet and other household tasks, like balancing finances. She became irritated and asked him when he was going, which led to him delaying the errand to handle finances. Eventually, she started her dinner and show, but five minutes in, he asked her to warm up the remaining formula for the baby. There was confusion about the amount, leading to a back-and-forth, and she ended up yelling at him, which he found upsetting, especially in front of the baby.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if others agree. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's look at the agreements. They had a prior agreement that after she left for the gym, he would take care of the errand. He didn't do that, which is a breach of their agreement. That's a point against him. She had prepared to have alone time, which is important for her well-being, especially after a long day. She communicated her need to relax, even checking with him multiple times if there was anything else. \n\nWhen he asked for help with the baby five minutes into her alone time, it's an interruption she specifically wanted to avoid. The confusion about the formula adds to her frustration, but it's unclear if he was trying to be difficult or if it was a genuine misunderstanding. However, the fact that he kept asking questions after she had already offered to help with whatever he needed (like preparing the baby for bath) suggests he might have known she wanted to be left alone but still chose to interrupt.\n\nHer yelling is the key issue here. Even if he was at fault in not following through on the errand and interrupting her, her response of yelling and doing so in front of the baby could be seen as overreacting. While she was stressed and had valid reasons to be upset, yelling can be hurtful and sets a bad example for the child. However, the husband's initial breach of their agreement and the interruption after she had clearly communicated her needs also contribute to the tension.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of both, but the question is specifically about the author. The husband didn't follow through on his part, which is a significant issue. However, the author's reaction of yelling might be seen as disproportionate, even if the husband was in the wrong first. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. If the husband had followed through, the situation might not have happened. But the author's response could have been handled more calmly, especially considering the presence of the baby.\n\nSo, while the husband's actions contributed to the problem, the author's yelling might be seen as her being in the wrong, but maybe only partially. However, the AITA format usually looks for the main person at fault. In this case, the husband broke the agreement, and the author's reaction was a result of that, but her yelling is what's being questioned. If the user thinks she's in the wrong, then answer A. But considering the prior agreement and his actions, maybe she's not entirely wrong. However, the act of yelling is typically seen as a red flag, so maybe answer A.\n"
