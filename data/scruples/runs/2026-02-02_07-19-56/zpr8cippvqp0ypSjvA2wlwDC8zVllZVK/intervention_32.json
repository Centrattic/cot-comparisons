My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a busy day, came home to relax, eat dinner, and watch a show. They had an agreement with their husband that he would run an errand to buy a travel bassinet after she got home from the gym. But instead, he asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks. She felt irritated, told him she was tired and wanted to relax, and then five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby. There was some confusion about the amount, and she yelled at him.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author worked a long day, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time. She clearly communicated her need to relax and even offered to help with tasks before starting her dinner. The husband didn't follow through on the errand and instead started asking questions and assigning tasks. When she was finally eating, he asked for her help again, leading to the argument.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that the tasks are important and that he's trying to manage responsibilities. He might not see that she's overextended. However, if there was an agreement that he would take care of the errand, his not doing that is a breach of that agreement. Also, interrupting her dinner when she had made it clear she wanted to relax seems like a breach of the communication she had with him.\n\nThe yelling part is tricky. Yelling can be seen as a loss of control, but if she felt her needs were consistently being disregarded, maybe she felt justified. However, the husband's point about yelling in front of the baby is valid, as it could affect the child. \n\nSo, considering that she had clearly communicated her need for time to herself and he didn't respect that by not following through on the errand and then interrupting her dinner with another task, maybe she isn't in the wrong. The husband didn't stick to the agreement and then kept interrupting her after she said she wanted to relax. Her reaction, while maybe intense, was in response to a pattern of behavior that didn't respect her boundaries. However, yelling might still be seen as inappropriate, regardless of the provocation.\n\nBut the key issue here is whether she was in the wrong. If the husband didn't follow through on his part of the agreement, then she wasn't in the wrong for being upset. The fact that he kept interrupting her after she made her boundaries clear probably means he's the one who mismanaged the situation. So maybe the answer is B (she's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The husband might have had valid reasons for the interruptions, but if the agreement was that he would run the errand, then he's the one who didn't meet his responsibility. So the author's frustration is valid, and her yelling, while not ideal, might be a reaction to her needs being consistently ignored. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
