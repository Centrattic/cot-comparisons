My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple dealing with household responsibilities and stress.\n\nFirst, the context: The woman had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, picked up their 4-month-old baby from daycare. They had a plan that after she returned from the gym, her husband would run an errand to buy a travel bassinet. Instead, he started asking her questions about the bassinet and other household tasks. She was exhausted, wanted to eat and relax, and tried to set boundaries. Then, five minutes into her relaxing time, he asked her to help with the baby's formula, leading to a conflict where she ended up yelling at him. The husband thinks she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby.\n\nNow, the key points here. The woman had communicated her need to have some alone time after a tiring day. She even asked multiple times if there were other tasks he needed done before she started dinner. The husband, however, didn't follow through on their agreed-upon plan to run the errand and instead started engaging her in tasks. Then, when she was trying to relax, he interrupted again with another request, which led to her losing her temper.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the husband didn't adhere to their prior agreement. He asked her to take on tasks when she had already stated she was too tired and wanted to rest. The woman had set boundaries, which the husband didn't respect. His interruption during her alone time, after she had made it clear, seems to be the root of her frustration. The fact that he kept asking about the formula amount, which was unclear, and didn't respect her need to eat and relax, might justify her reaction, even if yelling was the wrong way to handle it.\n\nHowever, yelling in front of a baby could be seen as negative, but the question is whether she's in the wrong. The husband not upholding his part of the agreement and then criticizing her for being upset might indicate that he's also at fault. The woman had a valid reason for being stressed and needed time to decompress. The husband's actions disrupted that, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nIn many relationships, when one partner doesn't respect the other's boundaries, it can lead to such reactions. The key issue here is the husband not following through on their agreement and then the interruption during her alone time. The woman's reaction, while perhaps not ideal, stems from a place of needing personal time after a long day. The husband's responsibility to run the errand and his subsequent interruption seem to be the main problems. So, in terms of who is in the wrong, the husband's actions might be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the author (the woman) isn't in the wrong for getting upset and yelling as a result of her boundaries being disrespected.\n"
