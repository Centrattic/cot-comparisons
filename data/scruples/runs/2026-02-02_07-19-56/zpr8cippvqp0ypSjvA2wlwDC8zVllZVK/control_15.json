My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a husband and wife with a 4-month-old baby.\n\nThe wife had a busy day at work and the gym. They agreed that the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet) while she went to the gym. When she came home, she wanted to relax, eat dinner, and watch a show. The husband didn't follow through on his task and instead started asking her questions about the bassinet and other household tasks. She got irritated, tried to manage her time, and asked if he was sure about not needing her help. He said no, so she started eating. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby. There was confusion about the amount, and the back-and-forth escalated until she yelled at him.\n\nThe key points here are the agreement they made, the husband's failure to stick to it, and the interruptions during her time to relax. The wife was clear she needed time to herself after a long day. The husband's interruptions, especially about the formula, disrupted her. However, the baby's needs are a priority, so the husband might be trying to get help. But the main issue is that he didn't follow the earlier agreement, leading to her frustration. The yelling was a reaction to being interrupted after trying to set boundaries. The husband scolded her for yelling in front of the baby, but the wife felt justified because he broke their agreement and kept interrupting her. \n\nConsidering all this, the wife isn't entirely in the wrong. The husband didn't adhere to their plan, leading to her frustration. The baby's needs are important, but the husband should have managed that without disrupting her time. The wife's reaction was a result of being pushed past her limits after a long day. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
