My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author had a busy day at work and went to the gym. They agreed with their husband that after the author left for the gym, the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet). But instead of leaving, the husband asked the author a bunch of questions and wanted help with household tasks like balancing finances. The author was tired, hungry, and wanted to relax. They finally asked when he was going, and they discussed the finances. The author tried to eat and watch a show, but five minutes into it, the husband asked for help warming up formula for the baby. There was confusion about the amount, and the author got frustrated, leading to yelling.\n\nSo, the key points: the husband didn't follow through on their agreement to run the errand right after the author left. Instead, he kept the author busy with other tasks. The author was clear about wanting time to eat and relax, but the husband interrupted. The argument was about the formula amount, which caused the author to lose it.\n\nThe husband's perspective: he might feel he was trying to get the information needed to complete the task, and maybe he didn't realize how much the author had been through that day. But the author had already been clear about needing downtime after a long day. The husband's actions disrupted that, which could be seen as neglecting the author's needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband agreed to handle the errand but didn't follow through as planned. He also didn't respect the author's request for uninterrupted time. The author's frustration builds up, leading to yelling, which can be a reaction to being overwhelmed and not having their needs acknowledged. The baby was present, so yelling isn't ideal, but the husband also didn't consider the author's state after a long day.\n\nSo, the husband made promises not kept, and the author's reaction, while perhaps not the best, stems from being overburdened and not having their needs respected. The answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the husband didn't adhere to their agreement and the author had a right to express their frustration, even if the method wasn't perfect.\n"
