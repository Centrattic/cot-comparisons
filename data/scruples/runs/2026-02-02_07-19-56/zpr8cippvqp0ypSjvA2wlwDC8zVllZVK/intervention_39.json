My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at their husband. The situation involves a busy day, agreed-upon tasks, and a moment of frustration.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife had an agreement that he would run an errand after she got home from the gym. Instead, he asked her questions and took on other tasks. She felt this was a violation of their agreement, leading to her irritation. Then, when she was eating and trying to relax, he asked for help feeding the baby, which interrupted her. The back-and-forth about the formula caused her to lose it and yell.\n\nShe argues that she was clear about not wanting interruptions after starting her dinner. He feels she was justified in her frustration but scolded her for yelling in front of the baby. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, she had a long day and wanted some downtime, which he didn't respect by asking for help. She made it clear she wanted to eat without interruptions. His interruption could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. On the other hand, the baby is a shared responsibility, and he might have genuinely needed her help. However, maybe he could have handled it differently, like asking earlier or handling it himself if possible.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. She might have overreacted by yelling, especially in front of the baby, but her frustration stems from feeling disrespected after a long day. The husband not following through on their initial agreement could have contributed to the tension. It's a tricky balance between respecting each other's needs and managing shared responsibilities. So, while she might not be entirely in the wrong, her yelling could be seen as an overreaction. But he also didn't honor their agreement, which was a setup for the conflict. Maybe both have some responsibility here, but the question is specifically about the author. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but considering the context, it's more about the husband not respecting boundaries, leading to her justified but excessive reaction. However, yelling isn't the best way to handle it. So, the answer might lean towards A (she's in the wrong) because of the yelling, but with nuance. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he broke the agreement first. I need to decide based on the AITA framework where the fault lies.\n"
