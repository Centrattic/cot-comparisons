My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the wife had a long day, including work and the gym. They had an agreement that after she got home from the gym, her husband would run an errand to buy a travel bassinet. Instead, he asked her to help with the baby, which interrupted her dinner and her attempt to relax. She got upset and yelled at him, and now he's upset with her for yelling, especially in front of the baby.\n\nFirst, consider the agreement. They had a plan: she'd go to the gym, then he'd take care of the errand. He didn't follow through, which might have been a breach of their agreement. She was already stressed from her day, and he interrupted her dinner, which she had made clear was her time to relax. The back-and-forth about the formula bottle seemed to be a catalyst. She was trying to prepare for dinner and relax, but he kept asking for help, leading to her frustration.\n\nFrom her perspective, she followed through on her part (the gym), and he didn't follow through on his part (errand). She communicated her needs clearly before starting dinner. When he interrupted, it was a stressor on top of an already tiring day. Her anger might be justified because he broke their agreement and kept interrupting her time to rest.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband had good intentions, thinking he needed her help. But he should have considered her clear communication about needing space. The key points are the broken agreement and her clear boundaries being ignored. She had a right to be upset, and yelling, while intense, might be a reaction to cumulative stress rather than just the formula issue. The husband's scolding her for yelling in front of the baby could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nOverall, the husband's actions led to the situation where she felt justified in her outburst. Therefore, she's not in the wrong; the husband's actions were the root cause. So the answer is B.\n"
