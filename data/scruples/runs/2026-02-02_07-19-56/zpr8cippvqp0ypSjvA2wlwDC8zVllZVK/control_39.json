My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband and wife dealing with childcare and personal time.\n\nFirst, the author had a busy day with work and the gym. They had a prior agreement that the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she got back from the gym. Instead of doing that, he started asking her about the purchase and other tasks, which made her irritated. She asked him to leave to get the bassinet, but he wanted to clarify things and they handled finances. She then started her dinner and a show, but five minutes in, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby. The back-and-forth about the formula amount led her to yell at him, and he thinks she was wrong to do so.\n\nSo, the key points here are: prior agreement, her desire for uninterrupted time after a hard day, and the interruption leading to her outburst. The husband argues she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby, and she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nI need to assess whether her reaction was justified. She had communicated her need for rest and clearly stated she wanted to eat and watch TV without interruptions. The husband didn't follow through on his part of the agreement, instead taking on tasks that she had already offered to help with. His interruption during her downtime might have been the trigger. However, when he needed help with the baby, it's part of their shared responsibilities. \n\nBut the problem is that he didn't respect her request to not be interrupted once she started her meal. Even if the baby needed feeding, maybe he could have handled it himself or asked her in a different way. Her frustration is understandable given the prior arrangement and her exhaustion. However, yelling and screaming, especially in front of a baby, might be seen as excessive, even if justified by the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband not following through on his errand and then interrupting her for baby tasks could be the root cause. She might not be entirely at fault if he didn't stick to the agreement. But reacting with yelling might not be the best approach, even if she felt wronged.\n\nConsidering the situation, it's a mix of both sides. However, since the question is whether the author is wrong, if her actions were a proportionate response to her husband's breach of their agreement and his constant interruptions despite her clear communication, then she might not be entirely wrong. But the yelling could still be seen as inappropriate, especially around the baby. So maybe the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong, because her frustration was due to unmet expectations and her husband not honoring their agreement. However, the manner of her response could be questioned. But in terms of right or wrong, perhaps it's not her fault entirely.\n"
