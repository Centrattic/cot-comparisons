My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong when they yelled at their husband for interrupting dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, the context: The wife had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, picked up the baby, and then after work, she expected her husband to handle the travel bassinet purchase. Instead, he started asking questions and doing other tasks. She tells him she's tired and wants to eat and relax. Then, five minutes into her show, he asks her to warm up formula for the baby. There's confusion about the amount, leading to an argument and her yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement to run the errand, which was a point of tension. The wife had clearly communicated she wanted to relax after a long day. The husband then interrupts her again with a task related to the baby, which seems to be a common responsibility in parenting. The wife's frustration builds up to yelling.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The wife had set boundaries, and the husband didn't respect them by not handling the errand and instead bringing up other tasks. The interruption during dinner adds to her stress. Yelling is a strong reaction, but considering the build-up of stress and unmet expectations, maybe it's understandable. However, yelling in front of a baby could be seen as poor handling of the situation. The husband might feel that the baby's needs are more immediate, but the wife felt her needs were being ignored again.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might have had reasons for not going out, maybe needing her input for the purchase, or thinking it was more efficient to handle tasks together. But he didn't communicate that clearly. The wife's frustration is valid, but the reaction might have been excessive. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs and managing emotions.\n\nI think the answer hinges on communication and mutual respect. The wife's anger is justified by the prior stress and broken agreement, but yelling isn't the best way to express that. So maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong) because even if frustrated, yelling, especially in front of the baby, is unhelpful. But others might say she's not in the wrong because the husband didn't follow through on his responsibilities. Hmm. The original poster thinks she is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
