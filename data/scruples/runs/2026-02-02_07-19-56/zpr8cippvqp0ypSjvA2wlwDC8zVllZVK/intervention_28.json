My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife with a baby, and some conflict over dinner time.\n\nFirst, the context: The wife had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, picked up the baby from daycare. They had agreed that after she got back from the gym, the husband would run an important errand to buy a travel bassinet. But he didn't leave; instead, he asked her lots of questions about the purchase and other tasks. She was tired, hungry, and wanted to relax. She finally asked when he was leaving, he said they needed to clarify some things. They did the finances, and she thought they were done. Then when she started eating and watching her show, he asked her to warm up the formula. She got upset and yelled.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The couple had an agreement that after she got back from the gym, he would handle the errand. He didn't follow through, and instead started involving her in other tasks. That's a problem because agreements are important in a relationship. He broke their agreement, which led to her stress and frustration. She was clear she needed time to herself, and he interrupted her. That's a key point. She had communicated her needs, and he didn't respect that.\n\nBut then, when he asked for the formula, she yelled at him. Yelling is never ideal, especially in front of a baby. It could be seen as an overreaction. However, her frustration was built up from him not keeping the agreement and interrupting her time. So maybe her anger was justified, but the yelling wasn't the best way to handle it. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that he was trying to handle the baby's needs, which are urgent. However, he also didn't stick to their plan. He should have taken responsibility for the errand without involving her in other tasks. The fact that he kept asking unclear questions about the formula also shows a lack of preparation or maybe not thinking ahead, which added to her stress.\n\nThe key factors here are the broken agreement, communication, and the method of expressing frustration. She had the right to be upset, but yelling might not be the best approach. However, considering the context of her exhaustion and the prior agreement, her reaction could be seen as a response to a pattern of behavior rather than a single incident.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If we look at the husband's actions first, he didn't follow through with their agreement and kept interrupting her. She was clear about her needs, and he didn't respect that. Her yelling was a result of that. While yelling isn't ideal, the root cause is his actions. Therefore, maybe she's not in the wrong. But maybe she could have handled it better. The question is whether she's in the wrong, not just about the yelling, but about the overall situation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she is partly at fault for yelling, but the husband is also wrong for not keeping the agreement. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually looks for who is more in the wrong. If the husband broke the agreement and kept interrupting, he's part of the problem. But the wife yelling is also an issue. However, since the question is about the author (the wife) being in the wrong, maybe the answer is B (No), because the husband didn't follow through and caused the situation, so her reaction, while not ideal, was understandable. But some might argue that she should have handled it calmly. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that the husband didn't honor their agreement and she was clear about her needs, the problem starts with him. Therefore, the wife isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
