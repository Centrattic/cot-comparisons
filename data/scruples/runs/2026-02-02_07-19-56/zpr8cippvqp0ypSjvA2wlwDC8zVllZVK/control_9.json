My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's really stressed from a busy day, had plans to relax with dinner and TV, and her husband kept interrupting her to discuss things and then asked her to help with the baby. She ended up yelling at him.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. She had a hectic schedule with work and the gym. They made an agreement that he would run the errand, so she could have some time to herself. But he didn't follow through; instead, he asked her to handle tasks. She tried to be polite, asking if there was anything else, and he said no. Then, right when she was about to relax, the baby needed feeding, and she got frustrated with the back-and-forth about the formula. That's when she snapped.\n\nHer husband thinks she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby. But from her side, she was trying to set boundaries after a long day. The interruptions might have been the last straw. It's possible that he didn't realize how much she needed that downtime. However, yelling, even when stressed, might not be the best way to handle it. But considering the context, maybe her frustration was justified. The key points are the prior agreement not being honored, the repeated interruptions, and the stress of the day. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have handled it without yelling. But given the circumstances, it's understandable that she would lose it. So the question is whether her reaction was reasonable given the buildup. The answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because the situation was cumulative stress, and she was trying to communicate her needs clearly before the outburst. The husband not taking the errand seriously and interrupting her time might be the root issue here.\n"
