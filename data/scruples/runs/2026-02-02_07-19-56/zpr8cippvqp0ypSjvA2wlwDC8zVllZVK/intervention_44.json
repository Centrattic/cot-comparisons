My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her husband after he interrupted her dinner to ask for help with the baby. \n\nFirst, the author had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time. They had an agreement that the husband would run an errand while she was at the gym. But instead of doing that, he started asking her questions about the bassinet and household tasks. The author was already stressed and hungry, so she got irritated. She managed to push through and even checked if he needed anything else, but then he interrupted her again about the baby's formula.\n\nThe key points here are the prior agreement and the husband's actions. The husband didn't stick to the plan, which disrupted her time. The author was clear she wanted to relax, but he kept asking for help. The interruption during dinner was the last straw, leading her to yell. \n\nNow, considering the husband's perspective, he might feel he's trying to manage responsibilities and communicate needs. However, breaking the agreement and interrupting her rest time without considering her state of mind could be seen as the root issue. The author's reaction, while perhaps intense, was in response to repeated interruptions despite her clear communication. Yelling might not be the best approach, but was she in the wrong? \n\nIn relationships, communication and respecting boundaries are crucial. If the husband agreed to handle the errand, he should have done that to allow her some time. His subsequent actions led to her frustration. While yelling is not ideal, the blame might be on both sides. The husband for not sticking to the plan and interrupting, and the author for reacting with yelling. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer might be B (No), because the husband didn't follow through on their agreement and kept interrupting after she had set boundaries. Her yelling was a reaction to those breaches. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, based on the information given, the husband's actions led to her outburst, so the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
