My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a married couple with a 4-month-old baby. The main issue is that the husband interrupted the wife during her dinner/relaxing time to ask for help feeding the baby, which led to the wife yelling at him. The husband feels she was unjustified in her reaction and scolded her for yelling in front of the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The wife had a very busy day with work and the gym, and they had an agreement that after her gym session, the husband would handle the errand. Instead, he asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks, which made her irritated. She tried to set boundaries by asking if he was done so she could eat and relax. However, after she started her meal, he interrupted her again to ask for help with the baby's formula, leading to the argument.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Agreement and Boundaries**: They had a prior agreement that the husband would run the errand after her workout. He didn't follow through, leading her to feel her time was being encroached upon. She tried to set clear boundaries before starting her dinner.\n2. **Communication Issues**: The husband kept asking questions and not following through with the errand, which could contribute to her stress and frustration.\n3. **The Interruption**: The final straw was the interruption during her dinner to handle the formula. The husband's persistence in not respecting her time could be a valid trigger for her outburst.\n4. **Parenting Style and Baby's Presence**: The husband criticized her for yelling in front of the baby, but the stress of the situation might be part of the reason for her outburst. However, yelling at the baby's father might not directly affect the child, though it's understandable he's concerned.\n5. **Shared Responsibilities**: Both parents have responsibilities, but the husband not adhering to their agreed-upon tasks might have escalated the situation.\n\nPossible angles:\n- The wife had valid reasons for being stressed and frustrated, leading to her outburst. She tried to set boundaries multiple times.\n- The husband didn't respect her boundaries and didn't take the initiative as they agreed, which could justify her reaction.\n- However, yelling, even if justified, can be seen as excessive. The husband might feel disrespected or that her reaction was too harsh given the circumstances.\n- The question is whether the wife was in the wrong for yelling. It depends on whether the husband's actions were a legitimate interruption or if she overreacted.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider the context of stress and prior agreements. Since the husband didn't follow through on their agreement and continued to interrupt, the wife's frustration is understandable. However, yelling is a strong reaction that could be seen as crossing a line, even if the situation was tense. The husband's criticism about yelling in front of the baby is valid if the baby was nearby, but the main issue is the interruption of her time.\n\nIt's possible that both parties have some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author (wife) is in the wrong. If the husband didn't respect her boundaries and the situation was built up, the wife's reaction might be seen as a result of the husband's actions. But yelling is a negative reaction that could have been avoided with better communication. However, given the context of her being exhausted and the husband not following through, some might side with her.\n\nI think the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the husband didn't respect her boundaries and the situation escalated due to his actions. The wife's frustration was justified, and the yelling was a result of the husband's persistent interruptions. However, the line between justified frustration and excessive yelling is thin. On the other hand, if the husband's request was urgent (feeding the baby), that might affect the judgment. But the wife had already tried to set boundaries, so the husband's interruption might be the main issue.\n"
