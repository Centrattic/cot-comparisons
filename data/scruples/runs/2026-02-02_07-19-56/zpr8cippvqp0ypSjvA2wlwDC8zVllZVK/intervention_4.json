My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a spouse who's upset because their husband interrupted their dinner to ask for help with the baby. The author claims they had a busy day, their husband didn't follow through on his agreed-upon task, and then interrupted their alone time. The argument escalates when the husband keeps asking about the formula, leading the author to yell.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The couple had a plan: the husband was to run an errand after the author left. But he didn't, instead asking her to handle tasks. She felt this was disrespectful after her long day. Then, when she was trying to relax, he asked her to warm up formula, leading to a misunderstanding and her yelling.\n\nKey points: The husband didn't stick to the agreement, which might have added stress. The author felt they were in their own space, trying to relax, and was interrupted. The husband might feel he needed help with the baby, which is a shared responsibility. The author's response was yelling, which the husband found excessive, especially in front of the baby.\n\nSo is the author in the wrong? Well, she did raise her voice and yelled. Yelling is a strong reaction, and while she had valid reasons (being tired, interrupted), it's important to consider if there was a better way to handle it. The husband's actions\u2014like not following through on the errand and interrupting\u2014might have contributed to her frustration. However, yelling in front of a baby can be seen as harmful, and the husband might have a point there. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did communicate her needs before dinner, but the husband still interrupted. That could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. The back-and-forth about the formula might have been a tipping point. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's right to need rest and the husband's need for help should be balanced. Maybe the husband should have handled things differently, but the author's yelling might still be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because while her frustration is understandable, yelling is a poor response, especially in front of a child. The husband's actions were inconsiderate, but that doesn't justify yelling. They could have found a better way to resolve the situation.\n"
