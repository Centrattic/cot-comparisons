My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author had a very busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time to eat and watch a show. They had a prior agreement that after she left for the gym, her husband would take care of an important errand. But he didn't do that immediately; instead, he asked her questions about the errand and other tasks. She was getting irritated because she wanted to relax and eat. After they handled some household stuff, she started her dinner and show. Then, five minutes in, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby, which led to a back-and-forth about the amount, and she ended up yelling at him.\n\nThe husband thinks she was in the wrong for yelling, especially in front of the baby. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nLet me consider both perspectives. The author had a long day and was promised alone time, which the husband didn't respect by engaging in tasks and then interrupting her dinner. The agreement was that he would run the errand, but he didn't, leading to frustration. The situation with the formula seems to be a point of contention. The author was clearly stressed and wanted to relax, which is understandable. However, yelling at the husband in front of the baby might not be the best way to handle the frustration, even if she had valid reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might have thought he was being responsible by handling the errand and other tasks, or maybe he misunderstood the agreement. The fact that he kept asking about the formula amount and not just taking it on himself could have contributed to the situation. But the key point is that the author was trying to set boundaries after a long day and her husband didn't respect those boundaries, leading to her losing her temper.\n\nI think the main issue here is the husband not following through on his part of the agreement and interrupting her downtime. The author's reaction was a result of accumulated stress and unmet expectations. While yelling might not be the ideal response, the root cause is the husband's actions that led to her frustration. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong here. The husband should have respected her request for alone time and handled the errand as agreed. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
