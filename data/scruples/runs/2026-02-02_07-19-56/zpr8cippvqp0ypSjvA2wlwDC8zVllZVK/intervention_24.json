My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wife yelling at her husband after he interrupts her dinner to ask for help with the baby. \n\nFirst, the context: The woman had a busy day with work and the gym, and she was looking forward to some alone time to eat and relax. They had agreed he would run an errand after she came home from the gym. Instead, he asked her questions and did tasks she had to handle, which made her irritated. When she was finally starting her show and dinner, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby, leading to a back-and-forth that made her lose her temper.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The wife was clear about needing alone time and had already offered to help before dinner. The husband, however, didn't follow through with his agreed-upon task and instead asked her to do things she hadn't committed to. The interruption during dinner seems to be the breaking point. \n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. She had communicated her need for space, and he didn't respect that by interrupting. However, the husband might argue that caring for the baby is a shared responsibility and that she shouldn't be upset about helping. \n\nThe yelling in front of the baby is a concern, but the root issue is whether she was justified in her reaction. The husband's actions breached the agreement they had, leading to her frustration. While yelling isn't ideal, the stress of the situation and the prior communication might support her feeling wronged. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that she overreacted, especially if he believed he was just asking for help. But since they had a prior agreement and he didn't stick to it, her frustration is understandable. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because she set boundaries and the husband didn't respect them. The yelling is a negative reaction, but the underlying issue is about unmet expectations and stress. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
