My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The author had a busy day with work and the gym, then picked up the baby. They had agreed that after her workout, the husband would run an errand. But when she got home, he didn't leave and instead asked about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting tired and irritated, so she asked when he was going to leave. They handled finances, and she finally started dinner and watching a show. Then five minutes in, he asked her to warm up formula, which led to confusion and frustration, resulting in her yelling.\n\nThe key points here are the prior agreement, the husband not following through as planned, the author's exhaustion, and the interruption during her alone time. The husband didn't go run the errand but instead asked her to handle tasks. The author felt her time was being invaded, and the baby situation added to her stress. The husband thinks she was unjustified in yelling and scolded her.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. The husband didn't stick to the agreed plan, which caused the author stress. The author communicated her needs but he still interrupted. Yelling in front of a baby is concerning, but the context of stress and prior frustration might explain it. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband didn't follow the agreed plan, then he might share some responsibility. The author was clear about needing alone time. However, yelling and screaming, especially in front of the baby, could be seen as excessive. The husband's actions (not leaving, not running the errand, interrupting despite her clear communication) contributed to the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe she could have calmly reminded him again about their agreement or handled the formula situation without yelling. But given her exhaustion and the repeated interruptions, her frustration is understandable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often face complex situations where both parties have some responsibility. The husband didn't follow through on his part, leading to her stress. The author's reaction, while intense, might be a result of her being pushed to her limits. However, yelling in front of the child is generally frowned upon. \n\nSo, the answer might be a nuanced AITA where both have points. But according to the user's initial thought, they think the author is in the wrong. The user's answer is A (Yes), but I need to assess whether that's accurate. The husband didn't adhere to the agreement, and the author's frustration is valid. However, yelling is a problem. Maybe the answer is A because the author overreacted despite the husband's fault. Or B because the husband was also at fault. \n\nAlternatively, the author's yelling might be justified given the circumstances. The husband didn't honor their agreement, and the author was clear about her needs. The interruption was the final straw after a day of stress. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But the yelling is a negative action. \n\nIn many AITA cases, the person who yells is often seen as the asshole. However, context matters. If the other person was at fault, the reaction might be excusable. The husband's failure to follow through and the author's clear communication could mean the author isn't entirely wrong. So maybe the answer is B. But I need to be careful. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I have to evaluate independently. \n\nGiven that the husband didn't stick to the plan and the author was clear about her needs, her frustration is understandable. However, yelling in front of the baby is a red flag. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about how to handle stress in relationships. \n\nConsidering typical AITA responses, the person who yells is often considered the asshole unless there's a significant provocation. Here, the provocation is real, but the method of response (yelling) might make her the asshole. So the answer could be A. But again, the husband's actions also contributed. \n\nThis is tricky. The user's answer is A, but I'm uncertain. The final answer would be A if the author is in the wrong for yelling despite the husband's fault. If the husband is equally at fault, maybe B. However, in AITA, the person who yells is often considered the asshole unless they have a very good reason. Since the author had a valid reason (husband not following through), maybe she's not the asshole. But the act of yelling is still problematic. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author overreacted. Even though the husband didn't follow the agreement, yelling is not the right response. The husband might have issues with communication, but the author's reaction could be seen as the problem.\n"
