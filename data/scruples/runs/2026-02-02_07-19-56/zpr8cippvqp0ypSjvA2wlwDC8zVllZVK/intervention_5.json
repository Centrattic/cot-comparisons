My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband and wife dealing with post-work responsibilities and a baby.\n\nFirst, the wife had a busy day, gym, and then expected alone time for dinner. They had agreed that the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she got home. But he didn't leave, instead asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks. She was irritated but tried to handle it by asking if he was done. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula. The communication broke down here, leading to her yelling at him.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the wife overreact, or was she justified in her anger? The husband didn't follow through on the agreed-upon task, which was a point of contention. The wife was clear she wanted alone time, and he interrupted. However, when he did ask for help with the baby, it's a valid request, especially since they have a newborn. \n\nThe husband's actions might have been inconsiderate by not leaving as agreed, leading to her being upset. But when he needed help with the baby, that's a responsibility they both share. The wife's reaction might have been triggered by prior frustration, but the timing and the fact that he kept asking about the formula amount could have been handled better. \n\nThe husband might feel that the baby's needs are immediate, and the wife shouldn't have been so rigid about her alone time. However, the wife had communicated her needs clearly, and the husband didn't honor that agreement. The yelling might be excessive, but the stress of the day and the baby's needs could contribute to that. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The wife might be in the wrong for yelling, but the husband didn't follow through on his part of the agreement. Maybe both could have handled it better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife did yell, which is a strong reaction, even if she was stressed. The husband also didn't honor the agreement, so there's some shared responsibility. But the main question is about the yelling. If the husband had followed through on his task, maybe the situation wouldn't have happened. However, the baby's need is urgent, so maybe the wife should have been more flexible. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because yelling at the husband for helping with the baby, even if it was an interruption, might be seen as an overreaction, especially in front of the baby. However, the husband's initial failure to follow through on their agreement is a mitigating factor. But the act of yelling is the main issue here. So, A for yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
