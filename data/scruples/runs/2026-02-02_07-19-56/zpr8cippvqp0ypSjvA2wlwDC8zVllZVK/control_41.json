My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is at fault here. So, the situation is that the author had a very busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was finally home, expecting some downtime. The husband didn't follow the agreed plan of taking care of the travel bassinet errand and instead asked her to do various tasks. Then, when she was eating and watching TV, he asked her to warm up formula, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their agreement. They had a prior arrangement that after she left for the gym, he would run the errand. He didn't do that and instead started asking her about the bassinet and other tasks. That's a problem because she had specifically asked for time to herself after her busy day. She even told him she was tired and wanted to relax without interruptions. So, he's not respecting her need for downtime and breaking their agreement.\n\nThen, when she finally starts eating, he interrupts again with the formula request. The back-and-forth about the amount of formula probably added to her frustration. She lost her temper, yelling at him and in front of the baby. The husband thinks she's in the wrong for yelling.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here: the husband didn't stick to their plan, kept asking for her help when she wasn't in a position to do it, and then she snapped. The question is whether she's at fault. \n\nIn terms of communication, the husband didn't honor their agreement, leading to her stress. She communicated her needs clearly, but he didn't respect them. The yelling is a reaction to being repeatedly interrupted and not being respected. While yelling isn't ideal, the root cause is the husband's failure to follow through. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The husband also has some responsibility here. The key issue is his not honoring their prior agreement and interrupting her time, which led to her outburst. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
