My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her husband after he interrupted her dinner to ask for help with the baby.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The author had a busy day, went to work, the gym, and picked up the baby. They had agreed that after she got home from the gym, her husband would run an errand for the baby. She was looking forward to some alone time to eat and watch a show, which her husband doesn't like. \n\nHer husband didn't leave immediately but instead asked her many questions about the bassinet and other household tasks. She was getting irritated, asked when he was leaving, and they discussed finances. She made it clear she wanted to eat and relax without interruptions. \n\nThen, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up the formula. There was confusion about the amount left in the bottle, leading to a back-and-forth. She ended up yelling because she felt interrupted and stressed. The husband thinks she was wrong to yell and scolded her in front of the baby.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author had communicated her need for downtime clearly before starting dinner. The husband, despite the agreement, didn't follow through on his part and instead kept asking her to handle tasks. This could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. However, he also had legitimate needs as a parent, needing to feed the baby. \n\nThe interruption might have been unavoidable, but the way he approached it might have been frustrating. The confusion over the formula amount could have been handled more calmly. The author was already stressed and had been trying to get through dinner without interruptions. Her reaction might stem from feeling that her boundaries were violated. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling in front of the baby could be seen as poor parenting, but the husband's initial actions set the stage for the conflict. The key points are communication breakdown and mutual understanding. The husband didn't stick to the agreed plan, leading to the author's frustration. However, the author's response was to yell, which might not be the best way to handle stress, but the context is important.\n\nIn AITA cases, people often consider if both parties have valid points. The author's frustration is understandable given her day, but the husband's needs are also valid. The question is whether she was in the wrong. Since she had made her boundaries clear and the husband didn't respect them, maybe she's justified. However, her reaction of yelling might be seen as excessive. But given the context, it's a common stress response. So, likely, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
