My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation based on the context given.\n\nFirst, the author had a busy day with work and the gym. They agreed with their husband that after her workout, he would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet). She was looking forward to some alone time to eat and relax. Instead, the husband stayed and asked her questions about the bassinet and household tasks, which made her irritated. She tried to set boundaries multiple times, but he kept interrupting. Then, when she was finally eating and watching a show, he asked her to warm up formula, leading to a conflict where she yelled at him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. They had a prior agreement, but the husband didn't follow through. The author communicated her need for time to herself several times, but he didn't respect that. The interruptions happened multiple times, which built up her frustration. The final incident with the formula was a breaking point.\n\nThe husband might feel he's helping by asking about household tasks, but the author clearly expressed her need for rest after a long day. The fact that she had to handle the baby's feeding again, even though they had an agreement, adds to the stress. The yelling happened after repeated disruptions, which might be a reaction to pent-up frustration.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're not considering the context of the prior stress and broken agreements. The husband might feel he was trying to collaborate, but the author's perspective is that her boundaries were not respected. So, it's a bit of a gray area, but the author's reactions might be justified given the circumstances. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the husband didn't adhere to their agreement, leading to her outburst.\n"
