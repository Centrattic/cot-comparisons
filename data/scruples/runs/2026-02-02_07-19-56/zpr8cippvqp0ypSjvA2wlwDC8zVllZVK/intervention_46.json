My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a woman who had a busy day at work and went to the gym. She and her husband had an agreement that after she came back from the gym, he would run an important errand (buying a travel bassinet for their 4-month-old baby). She was looking forward to some alone time to eat dinner and watch a show. However, her husband didn't leave as agreed. Instead, he started asking her questions about the bassinet and other tasks like balancing finances. She got irritated and told him she was tired and wanted to relax. He finally agreed, so she started eating and watching the show. Five minutes later, he interrupted again to ask her to warm up formula for the baby. There was a back-and-forth about how much formula to use, which led her to yell at him. He thinks she was wrong to yell, especially in front of the baby, and she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The husband didn't follow through on an agreement. They had agreed that after she returned from the gym, he would go get the bassinet. But he didn't. Instead, he started asking her about the bassinet and other tasks. She tried to set boundaries by asking if there was anything else before starting her dinner. He said no, so she started eating. Then he interrupted again for the baby's formula. The argument arises from her yelling because he broke their agreement and then interrupted her again, leading to the clash over the formula amount.\n\nNow, the husband's perspective: He didn't leave as agreed. Maybe he had reasons, like needing her input on the bassinet purchase or other tasks. But the problem is that he didn't follow through on their agreement. If they had agreed he would handle the bassinet, then he should have done that without involving her. Instead, he started asking questions, which she found annoying because she wanted time to herself. Then, when she was eating, he interrupted again. This seems like a breach of the agreement they had. \n\nThe user's frustration is understandable. She had a long day, wanted some personal time, and her husband didn't respect the agreement. The interruption during dinner is a key point here. People often feel stressed when their personal time is invaded, especially after a busy day. The formula situation might have been a tipping point for her. The back-and-forth about the amount could have been frustrating because of the time pressure and her desire to just relax.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that he was trying to get the necessary information to complete the task, or he might have thought she would help. But since they had an agreement for him to handle it, his actions seem to disregard that. Also, the fact that he kept interrupting after she explicitly stated she needed to relax could be seen as not respecting her needs.\n\nThe question is whether she was wrong to yell. Yelling is a strong reaction, and it's concerning that it was in front of the baby. However, the root cause is her husband not following through on their agreement and interrupting her without respecting her boundaries. If the husband had honored the agreement, there wouldn't have been the interruption. So maybe the author's reaction is a result of her husband's actions. But yelling is a form of communication that can be harmful, especially in front of a child. It might not be the best way to address the issue, but the fault could be shared. \n\nHowever, the user's initial statement says they had agreed he would go alone. If he didn't follow through, that's his mistake. But when he asked her to help with the baby during dinner, that's another interruption. So she's within her rights to be upset. The problem is that she responded with yelling, which is aggressive. But considering the context of her being stressed and exhausted, maybe it's understandable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: the husband didn't follow the agreement, leading to her frustration. The formula situation was an additional interruption. The yelling is a reaction to his previous actions. So perhaps the husband is also at fault for not respecting the agreement and the interruptions. However, the user's response was yelling, which is not a good way to handle it, especially with a baby present. So maybe both are at fault, but the question is specifically about the author. \n\nIf the answer is A (yes, she's in the wrong), it's because she yelled. If it's B (no), it's because he was the one who broke the agreement and interrupted her. \n\nI think there's a nuance here. The user's actions (yelling) are reactive, but the husband's actions (not following the agreement and interrupting) are the cause. However, the user could have handled it differently, like calmly explaining her frustration. But given the circumstances, maybe her reaction is somewhat justified. The key is whether she's in the wrong. If the husband was wrong in the first place, then she's not entirely at fault. But yelling is a poor choice regardless. \n\nI'm leaning towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) often looks at both sides but sometimes the person who initiated the problem is the one at fault. Here, the husband didn't follow the agreement, so he's partly at fault. The user's yelling is a consequence, but maybe she's also at fault for the reaction. But the question is whether she is in the wrong. In AITA scenarios, the person who yells is often considered at fault because of the aggressive communication, but the underlying issues matter too. \n\nIn this case, the user's reaction is a result of her husband's failure to adhere to their agreement and then interrupting her. So maybe she's not at fault for the yelling because she was trying to communicate her needs, albeit poorly. Alternatively, she should have found a better way to handle it. \n\nI think the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because yelling is a form of aggression, especially in front of a baby. But others might argue that the husband was the root of the problem. However, in AITA forums, the person who lashes out is usually considered to be in the wrong unless there's a clear provocation. Since the husband did break the agreement and then interrupted her, the user's frustration is understandable, but the yelling is still the problem. \n\nAlternatively, if the husband was wrong for not following the agreement, then the user's reaction is a response to his wrongdoing. But the question is about her being in the wrong. If she's in the wrong, it's because she yelled. If she's not, it's because he was the one at fault. \n\nI think the answer is A. Because even though the husband was at fault for not following the agreement, the user's reaction (yelling) is what's being evaluated here. Yelling is generally considered an asshole move, even if provoked. So the answer is A.\n"
