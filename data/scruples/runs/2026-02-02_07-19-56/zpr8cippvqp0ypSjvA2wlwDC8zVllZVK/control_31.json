My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she had a really busy day at work and the gym, and they had an agreement that after her gym session, her husband would run an important errand. Instead, he asked her questions and did other tasks, delaying the errand. Then when she was finally eating and relaxing, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, she had a stressful day and was looking forward to some downtime. They had a clear agreement about who was doing what, and he didn't follow through. He kept asking her questions and doing other tasks instead of going to the store. Then, when she was trying to eat, he interrupted her to handle the baby's formula. The back-and-forth about the amount of formula probably added to her frustration.\n\nShe was clearly exhausted and wanted to relax. He didn't honor the agreement, and then interrupted her during her only free time. The yelling happened after multiple interruptions and not being respected, which might be a reaction to built-up stress. However, yelling at someone in front of a baby can be seen as inappropriate, even if the situation is stressful.\n\nBut considering the context: she was trying to communicate her needs, he didn't respect her boundaries, and the interruptions were ongoing. The fact that he didn't adhere to the initial agreement might justify her frustration. So maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. But yelling is a harsh reaction, even if it's understandable. The key points are the prior agreement, his failure to follow through, and the cumulative stress leading to her outburst. The husband's reaction might be dismissing her valid stress, but she could have handled the situation better without yelling. However, given the circumstances, her reaction is a result of being consistently interrupted and unrespected.\n"
