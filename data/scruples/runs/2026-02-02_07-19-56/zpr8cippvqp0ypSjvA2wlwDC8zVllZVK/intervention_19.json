My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her husband when he interrupted her dinner to ask about the baby. \n\nFirst, the author had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time. They had an agreement that the husband would run an errand after she got home. Instead, he asked her questions about the errand and other tasks. She was getting irritated but tried to manage her frustration by setting boundaries. Then, after she started dinner, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby, which led to confusion and her yelling.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he thought they were clarifying things before she ate, and he didn't intend to interrupt. The author felt her boundaries were crossed, leading to her outburst. The husband is upset about her yelling in front of the baby.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the author had clearly communicated her need for alone time and dinner. The husband, despite agreements and her clear communication, interrupted. The author's frustration builds up, leading to an emotional response. While yelling isn't ideal, especially around the baby, the underlying issue is about respecting boundaries and communication. The husband might have breached those boundaries. However, the author's reaction was an outburst. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both have valid points. The author had a right to feel her space was invaded, but yelling might not have been the best way to express that. The husband should have respected her request not to be interrupted. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. While her reaction was poor, the root cause was the husband not respecting her needs. But in terms of blame, maybe both share some responsibility. However, in AITA scenarios, often the person who acted out is considered the asshole unless there's a valid reason. Here, the author's outburst is the direct action leading to the question. So maybe she's in the wrong for yelling, but the husband's actions contributed. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since she did yell, and while understandable, it's considered an asshole move. So answer A.\n"
