My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a wife yelling at her husband for interrupting her dinner to help with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The wife had a busy day at work and went to the gym. They had agreed that the husband would run an errand after she left. When she got home, she was expecting alone time to relax and eat. Instead, the husband asked her about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting irritated but tried to manage by asking if he was done. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up the baby's formula. There was confusion about the amount left in the bottle, leading to a back-and-forth. She ended up yelling at him.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreed-upon tasks, her desire for alone time, and the interruption. The husband didn't follow through on the agreement and instead kept asking her about other stuff. Then when he asked about the formula, there was confusion that escalated her frustration.\n\nI need to consider if the wife was wrong to yell. She was clear about wanting to relax after a long day. Her husband didn't stick to the plan and interrupted her. He also kept questioning her even after she was trying to help. The escalation might be due to his repeated interruptions and not respecting her time.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel he needed help with the baby, and maybe he thought he was being clear. But the problem is he didn't honor the agreement and kept bringing up other tasks. The wife did offer to help with anything before eating, and he said no. Then the interruption came after that.\n\nThe baby's presence is a factor, but the main issue is the husband's actions leading to the conflict. The wife's response was a result of built-up frustration. So, maybe the husband is in the wrong for not respecting her time and the agreement. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for getting upset and yelling. Answer B.\n"
