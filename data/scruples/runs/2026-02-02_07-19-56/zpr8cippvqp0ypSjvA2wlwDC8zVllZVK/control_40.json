My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife with a 4-month-old baby. The wife is exhausted from a busy day at work and the gym, and expected her husband to handle a specific task (buying a travel bassinet) so she could have some alone time for dinner and relaxation.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the agreements they made. They had a plan: after she returned from the gym, he would take care of the bassinet purchase. However, he instead started asking her questions about the bassinet and other household tasks. This went against their agreement, which is a key point. She was clearly tired and wanted to have time to herself, which is understandable after a long day.\n\nThen, when she was finally eating and watching TV, he interrupted her to ask her to warm up formula for the baby. The back-and-forth about the amount of formula left in the bottle seems to have escalated the situation. The wife lost her temper, yelling at him and expressing her frustration about the interruptions.\n\nThe husband's response is that he thought she was in the wrong for yelling, especially in front of the baby. The wife's side is that she was clear about needing uninterrupted time, and he didn't respect that by asking for her help with tasks he was supposed to handle himself.\n\nKey factors here include:\n1. The pre-arranged plan: He was supposed to handle the bassinet, but he didn't. This is a breach of their agreement.\n2. Her exhaustion and need for self-care: After a long day, needing time to relax is valid.\n3. The interruption during her alone time: Getting asked to help with the baby's feeding after agreeing not to be interrupted.\n4. Communication issues: The confusion over the formula amount led to frustration, which might have been mitigated with clearer communication.\n\nThe husband's actions (not following through on his responsibility, then interrupting her time) contributed to her losing her temper. While yelling at him might not be the ideal response, the root cause is his failure to respect the prior agreement and her need for rest. The wife's frustration is justified given the circumstances, but the way she expressed it (yelling in front of the baby) is something to consider.\n\nHowever, in AITA contexts, the question is whether the person is the asshole. The husband didn't follow through on his responsibilities, leading to the conflict. The wife's reaction, while not ideal, stems from being overwhelmed and having her boundaries disregarded. So the husband's actions likely contributed more to the situation. The baby being present adds a layer, but the main issue is the husband's initial failure to adhere to the plan and the subsequent interruption.\n"
