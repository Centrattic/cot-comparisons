My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her husband. The context is that the wife had a busy day with work and the gym, wanted to relax with dinner and a show, but her husband kept interrupting with baby-related tasks and questions.\n\nSo, first, the husband agreed to handle the travel bassinet purchase as they'd planned. Instead, he asked her questions and assigned other tasks. The wife clearly communicated her need for alone time after agreeing to prioritize those tasks first. But then, after she started her dinner and show, he asked her to warm up formula, leading to a back-and-forth about the amount left in the bottle. This caused her to lose it and yell.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The wife did set boundaries beforehand. She even asked if there was anything else he needed, and he said no. Then when she started eating, he interrupted. The husband might have thought he was handling the formula feeding, but maybe he didn't realize the impact on her. The key points are communication and boundaries. She did try to set her needs, but perhaps the husband didn't take them seriously enough. \n\nThe husband's actions in interrupting her after she set her boundaries might justify her frustration. However, yelling and raising her voice at him, especially in front of the baby, could be seen as an overreaction, even if she was stressed. The husband's point is about her yelling in front of the baby, which could affect the child's environment. \n\nBut on the other hand, the wife had legitimate reasons for being exhausted and needing space. The husband didn't respect her initial boundaries by asking for help after she said she wanted to relax. So, maybe both sides have points. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. Yelling might be a valid expression of frustration but not the best way to handle it. So, depending on perspective, the answer could swing either way.\n\nBut in AITA scenarios, the expectation is often about mutual respect and communication. The wife did communicate her needs, but her response was yelling. The husband didn't follow through on his agreed-upon task, leading to interruptions. So maybe the husband is also at fault for not respecting the agreement. However, the wife's reaction, while understandable, might be considered over the top. So perhaps the answer is A (yes, she's in the wrong) because even though the husband didn't follow the plan, yelling is not the best response. Alternatively, if the husband's actions were the root cause, maybe she's not in the wrong. Hmm. I'm leaning towards A because the husband didn't follow through, but the yelling might be the issue here. Wait, the user initially thought the author was wrong. The user's comment is that they think the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my thought. So maybe the answer is A. But I need to make sure. Another angle: the husband asked for help after she said no more interruptions. So he's at fault for not respecting her time. The wife's yelling is a reaction to that. So maybe the husband is more in the wrong, but the wife's yelling still makes her at least partially responsible. However, in AITA terms, sometimes the person who is frustrated is seen as not in the wrong if they communicated their needs. But the method of communication (yelling) is the issue. So perhaps the answer is A. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the correct answer is B (not in the wrong) because the husband didn't follow through, and she had valid reasons. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the key is that she set boundaries, and he didn't respect them. Her yelling is a reaction to that, so she's not entirely wrong. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
