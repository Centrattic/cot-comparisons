My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their husband when he interrupted her dinner to help with the baby. \n\nFirst, the wife had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, and was looking forward to some alone time. They had agreed that after she left for the gym, the husband would run an errand. But he didn't follow through, instead asking her about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting irritated and finally set a boundary, saying she was tired and wanted to eat and relax. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked for help with the baby's formula, leading to a back-and-forth that caused her to yell.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both perspectives. The wife had communicated her needs clearly, but the husband didn't stick to the agreement. He kept asking her to do things even after she said she wanted to relax. The interruption during her dinner and show was a trigger because she had been stressed and needed that time. The husband's actions might have been well-intentioned, but he didn't respect her boundaries. However, yelling, especially in front of the baby, is problematic. \n\nThe key points are: the agreement wasn't honored, the wife communicated her boundaries, but the reaction was a yelling episode. So, while the husband made a mistake by not following through and interrupting, the wife's response of yelling might be seen as disproportionate. But given the context of her exhaustion and prior communication, maybe it's understandable. The community often looks at whether the action was a justified reaction to a pattern of behavior. Here, the husband had already broken the agreement and kept adding tasks, so the yelling might be a result of built-up frustration. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband's actions were a breach of their agreement and she had clearly stated her need for rest, then her yelling might be seen as a reaction to being disrespected. However, yelling in front of the baby could be seen as unkind, even if justified. The husband's argument is that he was just trying to help, but not following through on his initial task. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community tends to consider the context. The wife had a valid reason due to her exhaustion and broken agreement, but the yelling is a negative behavior. So maybe the answer is B (No), as she's not in the wrong because she had a reason and communicated her needs, but she could have handled it better. Or A (Yes) if the yelling was excessive. However, given the setup and prior communication, the answer is likely B.\n"
