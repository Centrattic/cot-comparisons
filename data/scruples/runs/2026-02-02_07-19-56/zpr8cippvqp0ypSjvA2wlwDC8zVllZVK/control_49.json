My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a wife who yells at her husband after he interrupts her dinner to ask for help with the baby. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, she had a really busy day\u2014work and the gym. They had an agreement that after she got home from the gym, he would run an important errand (buying a travel bassinet) ASAP. She leaves immediately after dropping them off, so her day is packed. When she gets home, she's expecting some alone time to eat and watch a show she doesn't share with her husband. Instead of him going out, he's asking her about the bassinet and other tasks like balancing finances. She's getting irritated and finally asks him when he's leaving. He says they need to clarify a few things, so they handle the finances. She checks again if he needs anything else, and he says no. She starts eating and watching the show.\n\nThen, five minutes in, he asks her to warm up the formula. The bottle is partially used, and she can't see how much is left without pouring it. She asks if he wants the rest or a specific amount (120 mL). He says it's the rest. When she's getting up, he starts asking again about the amount left. She pours out 120 mL, he keeps questioning how much is left. She loses it and yells.\n\nHe thinks she was wrong to yell in front of the baby. So the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nLet me think about the key points. The couple had an agreement that he would take care of the errand. He didn't follow through and instead started asking her about other things. She was trying to set boundaries, even checking again if he needed anything else, and he still interrupted her after she said she wanted to relax. The interruption was about a baby task, which is necessary, but he might have been expecting her help because of shared responsibilities.\n\nBut she had already been set up for stress because he didn't do what they agreed. She had to deal with his interruptions, which made her irritated. When he asked for the formula, there was confusion, leading to her outburst.\n\nPossible angles: 1. Did she have the right to expect him to follow through on their agreement? 2. Was his request reasonable despite her stated need to relax? 3. Is yelling justified in this situation?\n\nHe had agreed to handle the errand, so not doing it and instead asking her for help might have broken the understanding. She was trying to set boundaries, which is valid. However, the baby's needs are important, and maybe he felt he needed her help. The confusion with the formula might have been a minor issue that escalated.\n\nBut she had already been stressed and clearly communicated she wanted to relax. The interruption after she had already started eating and watching TV might have been the last straw. Yelling is not ideal, but the context shows a build-up of issues. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether her reaction was proportionate. She had been trying to set boundaries, and he kept interrupting. The formula confusion might have been the trigger, but the underlying issue was his not honoring their agreement and her need for downtime.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, emotional distress and communication issues are considered. The husband might feel he needed help, but the wife's need for rest after a busy day is also valid. Since they had an agreement that he would take care of the errand, his not doing that and instead asking her for help could be seen as a breach, leading to her frustration. The yelling might be a result of built-up stress rather than just the formula incident. So the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. However, yelling in front of the baby is a common point of contention. But considering the context, she might be justified. So answer B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
