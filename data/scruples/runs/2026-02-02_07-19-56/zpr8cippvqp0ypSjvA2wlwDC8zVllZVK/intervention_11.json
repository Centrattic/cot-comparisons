My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for yelling at her husband after he interrupted her dinner. Let me go through the context again to understand both sides.\n\nFirst, the author had a busy day with work and the gym, and they had previously agreed that the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet) after she got home. However, he didn't leave right away and instead asked her about the bassinet and other tasks. She was tired and wanted to eat and watch a show alone. When he finally left to run the errand, she started dinner and her show. Five minutes in, he needed her to warm up formula for the baby, which led to confusion about the amount, and she ended up yelling at him.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author had clearly communicated her need to relax after a long day. The husband, on the other hand, didn't follow through with the agreed-upon task immediately and then interrupted her during her alone time. The interruption came at a time when she was trying to unwind, which could contribute to her stress. The husband's actions might have been seen as not respecting her boundaries, especially since they had discussed this beforehand.\n\nHowever, the husband did ask her if there was anything else before she started eating, and she confirmed there wasn't. Then, when he needed help with the baby, he might have felt it was an emergency. But the way he approached it\u2014interrupting her dinner\u2014could be problematic. The author's reaction was yelling and being upset, which might be excessive, but given her exhaustion and the prior stress, it's understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that the baby's needs are urgent and that he tried to coordinate but things went sideways. He also felt scolded in front of the baby, which could affect the child. But the author's frustration stems from unmet expectations and a lack of respect for her time.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She did yell, which can be seen as inappropriate, especially in front of the baby. However, the context shows she had valid reasons for being stressed. The husband didn't stick to their agreement and interrupted her alone time. It's a tough call because both sides have points. However, the key is whether the author was wrong to yell. Even if frustrated, yelling could be seen as overreacting, but considering the circumstances, maybe she's not entirely at fault. The question is whether the husband respected her boundaries enough. If he did interrupt despite her clear communication, maybe she's not wrong. But maybe she should have handled it calmly. I'm a bit torn here. The answer might depend on cultural norms about communication in relationships. In some views, the husband should have left as agreed, and the author's frustration is justified. But yelling might be too much. Alternatively, maybe the husband's request was a legitimate need, and the author overreacted. Hmm. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the husband didn't follow through on the agreement and interrupted her alone time, leading to her frustration. However, yelling is still a poor choice. But given the context, maybe she's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if yelling is considered wrong regardless, maybe A. But the question is whether the person is in the wrong, not just if they overreacted. So the answer might be B.\n"
