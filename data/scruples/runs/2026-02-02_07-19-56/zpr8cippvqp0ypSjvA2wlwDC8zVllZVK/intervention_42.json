My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their husband when he interrupted their dinner to help with the baby. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a really busy day with work and the gym. They had an agreement that after their gym session, the husband would run an errand (buying a travel bassinet). But instead, he asked her questions about the bassinet and other tasks. She was getting irritated and finally asked when he was leaving, which he delayed to clarify things. They did some finance stuff, and she made it clear she wanted to eat and relax without interruptions. Then, five minutes into watching her show, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby. There was some back and forth about the amount, and she ended up yelling at him, and now he thinks she's wrong for yelling in front of the baby.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the agreement, the interruptions, and the baby situation. The author set clear boundaries about wanting alone time after a long day. The husband didn't stick to the agreement and kept asking her to do things. However, when the baby needed feeding, that's a responsibility they both share. Even if the husband didn't follow the agreement, the baby's needs might be urgent. The author was frustrated, but yelling might not be the best way to handle it. But was she in the wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the husband didn't honor their agreement, leading to her stress and irritation. On the other hand, the baby's feeding is a necessary task, and even if it's inconvenient, it's part of parenting. She might have been clear about her boundaries, but maybe she could have handled the situation calmly instead of yelling. However, the husband's initial interruptions after agreeing to leave for the errand might have built up her frustration. The baby situation was a final trigger.\n\nThe husband might feel wronged because he's trying to manage their responsibilities and the baby's needs, and the yelling in front of the baby is a concern for him. The question is whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. She had a long day, set boundaries, and the interruptions continued. The baby's feeding is necessary, but the way she reacted might have been harsh, even if justified in her frustration.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the husband didn't follow through on their agreement, leading to stress. But she could have addressed the situation without yelling. Alternatively, the husband might have handled the baby's feeding himself if it was urgent. The answer might be nuanced. But in typical AITA scenarios, if someone breaks a prior agreement and causes stress, they might be more in the wrong, but the reaction also matters. The author's reaction was yelling, which can be seen as harsh, but the buildup of frustration is there. So maybe the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because the husband didn't stick to their initial plan, leading to her irritation, and the baby situation was a necessary but interruption, but her yelling was a reaction to a series of issues. Alternatively, maybe she should have handled it differently, but the husband's actions contributed. So the answer might be B.\n"
