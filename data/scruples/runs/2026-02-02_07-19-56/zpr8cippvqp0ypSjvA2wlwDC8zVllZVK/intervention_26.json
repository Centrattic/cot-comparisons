My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife dealing with a baby and some misunderstandings about household responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a busy day with work and the gym, and the plan was for the husband to run an errand (buy a travel bassinet) after the author got home from the gym. Instead, he started asking questions and doing other tasks. The author was trying to get some alone time for dinner and a show. When she finally starts eating, the husband interrupts her to ask about feeding the baby. There's a back-and-forth about the formula amount, leading to the author yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are: agreed-upon responsibilities, communication breakdown, the author's need for rest, and the interruption during dinner. The author felt her boundaries were crossed by the husband not following the plan and then interrupting her when she wanted to relax. The husband thinks she overreacted, especially in front of the baby.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. The husband did not follow through on his agreed task, which the author was counting on to unwind. She tried to set boundaries by checking if he needed anything else before starting dinner. The interruption during dinner was after she clearly communicated her need for space. The argument about the formula could have been miscommunication, but the husband kept pressuring her for information that wasn't clear.\n\nShe did yell, which might be an overreaction in terms of volume, but given the stress and exhaustion, maybe understandable. Yelling in front of the baby is a valid concern for the husband, but the root issue is about unmet expectations and stress. The husband's responsibility was to handle the bassinet purchase, which he didn't do, leading to the author having to handle it, but in a stressful way.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Arguably, she shouldn't have yelled, but the husband didn't follow through on his part. Maybe both have some responsibility. But according to AITA standards, the question is whether she's the asshole. If the husband broke their agreement, and she was trying to enforce her boundaries, then she's not the one in the wrong. However, yelling is a negative reaction. But given the context, perhaps she's not the asshole here. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
