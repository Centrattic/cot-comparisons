My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife yells at her husband for interrupting her dinner to help with the baby. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The wife had a busy day, worked, went to the gym, picked up the baby, and then when she got home, she was looking forward to some alone time to eat and watch TV. The husband was supposed to run an errand (buy a travel bassinet) but instead he asked her questions and did household tasks. She was getting irritated but tried to handle it by setting boundaries. Then, five minutes into her show, he asked her to warm up formula for the baby, which led to a back-and-forth, and she ended up yelling.\n\nNow, the key points here are the expectations and communication between the couple. They had an agreement that after she went to the gym, he would take care of the errand. But he didn't follow through. Instead, he asked her to help with tasks. She tried to set boundaries by asking if there were more things to do, and he said no. Then she started eating and watching TV, expecting him to handle the errand. However, he didn't follow through and interrupted her again with the baby's formula.\n\nThe question is whether she was wrong for yelling. From her perspective, she was clear about her needs after a long day, and he didn't respect her boundaries. The husband's actions might have breached the agreement they had, leading to her frustration. Yelling is a strong reaction, but it's in the context of her being exhausted and feeling interrupted despite setting clear expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that he was trying to handle the tasks and that he wasn't aware of the exact formula amount, leading to confusion. He might also feel that his request was reasonable given the baby's needs. However, the main issue is whether he respected her time as agreed. If he had gone to run the errand, the situation might have been avoided.\n\nSo, considering that they had a prior agreement and he didn't stick to it, leading to her being interrupted, it seems like he might be at fault for not following through. Her reaction, while perhaps excessive, stems from a place of needing rest after a hard day. However, yelling in front of the baby could be seen as negative regardless. But the core issue is his breach of the agreement. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but based on the analysis, maybe the husband is the one at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband didn't honor their agreement and interrupted her despite her clear communication.\n"
