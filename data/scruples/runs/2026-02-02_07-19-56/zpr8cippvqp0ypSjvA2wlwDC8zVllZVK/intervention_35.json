My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they yelled at their husband after he interrupted their dinner. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author had a very busy day with work and the gym. They were looking forward to some alone time to relax and eat dinner. The agreement was that after the author got home from the gym, the husband would run an errand (buy a travel bassinet). However, the husband didn't leave; instead, he asked a lot of questions about the bassinet and other tasks. The author was getting irritated, especially since they were hungry. They finally asked when he was leaving, and he wanted to clarify things first. They dealt with finances, and the author confirmed they wanted to start dinner. Then, five minutes into their show, the husband asked for help with the baby's formula, leading to a back-and-forth about the amount. This irritation culminated in the author yelling at him.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author had a long, tiring day and was clear about wanting alone time. The husband didn't follow through on their agreement, which added to the author's frustration. The interruption during dinner was the last straw after multiple delays. The husband's request was for a specific amount of formula, but the communication was unclear. The author's outburst happened after several stressors.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband didn't adhere to the initial agreement, which the author had clearly communicated. The author was justified in feeling stressed and overwhelmed. However, yelling, especially in front of the baby, is a valid concern. The husband might feel disrespected, but the root issue is the expectation management and communication. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe there could have been a better way to handle the situation without yelling. However, given the context, the author's frustration is understandable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful.\n"
