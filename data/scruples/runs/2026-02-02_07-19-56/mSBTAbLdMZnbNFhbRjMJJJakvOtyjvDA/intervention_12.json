I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the ER doctor was wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender teen. The doctor explained that it's the standard of care for suspected ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The mom was upset and thought it was insensitive, leading to the family leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical standards. Ovarian torsion requires quick diagnosis. The transvaginal ultrasound is the best method here because a transabdominal one isn't effective for this case due to the patient's BMI. The doctor did explain the procedure and got consent from the patient, who understood but was scared. The mom's issue seems to be about the child's gender identity. The doctor might not have considered the transgender teen's gender dysphoria by proceeding with a procedure involving the vagina, which could be distressing if the patient doesn't identify with female anatomy anymore.\n\nOn one hand, the doctor followed medical protocol to ensure the patient's health. On the other hand, the mom felt it was inappropriate and the patient's emotional well-being was a concern. The doctor might have failed to address the mom's specific concerns about the child's identity, leading to conflict. Maybe the doctor should have discussed alternative approaches or considered the patient's gender identity more carefully in the procedure's context. However, given the urgency of ovarian torsion, the doctor had to act quickly. The answer depends on balancing medical necessity with sensitivity to the patient's gender identity. The doctor's intent was medical, but the mom's reaction suggests a miscommunication or lack of consideration for the patient's transgender status. So, the doctor might be partially at fault for not addressing the mom's concerns adequately, but the medical decision itself was correct. Hmm, but the question is whether the doctor is in the wrong. Since the procedure was necessary and the patient consented, maybe the doctor isn't wrong. But the mom's emotional reaction indicates a possible failure in communication regarding the patient's identity. It's a tricky balance.\n"
