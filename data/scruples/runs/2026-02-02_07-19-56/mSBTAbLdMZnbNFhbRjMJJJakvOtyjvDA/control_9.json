I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the ER doctor (the author) was in the wrong when they ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The patient is a trans teen on testosterone but still has a uterus and ovaries. They presented with possible ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor wanted a transvaginal ultrasound for a better view, but the mother was upset and left. \n\nSo, the key points are: medical necessity versus the mother's concerns about sensitivity. The doctor explained the procedure and why it's the gold standard. The mother felt it was insensitive and might cause dysphoria. \n\nNow, the question is whether the doctor was wrong. From a medical standpoint, ovarian torsion is urgent, and the transvaginal ultrasound is the best method here. The doctor tried to explain and accommodate. The mother's reaction was emotional, but the doctor's duty is to the patient's health. \n\nPossible angles: Was there a failure to consider the patient's gender identity? Maybe the doctor could have done more to make the procedure comfortable, like having a provider who's experienced with trans patients, but the doctor did explain and said they would reduce discomfort. The mother's threat might be overreaction, but the patient's safety is paramount. \n\nI think the doctor wasn't wrong because they followed medical guidelines and tried to be considerate. The mother's disagreement doesn't make the doctor at fault. So answer B.\n"
