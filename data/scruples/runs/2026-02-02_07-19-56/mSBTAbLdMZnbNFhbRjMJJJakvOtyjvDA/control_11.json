I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the ER doctor is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation involves a medical emergency\u2014ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor explained that a transvaginal ultrasound is the standard procedure to assess this, but the mother got upset and left. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical necessity. Ovarian torsion is time-sensitive, and CT scans aren't as effective here. The doctor explained why the transvaginal ultrasound is the best option. But the mother is upset because her son is transgender and might find the procedure distressing. The doctor tried to explain the procedure in simple terms and ensure the kid understood.\n\nNow, the key points are: Was the doctor respectful and clear in explaining the procedure? Did they consider the patient's gender identity? The doctor mentioned explaining the procedure in common terms, but maybe didn't consider the emotional impact on the transgender teen. However, in an emergency, the priority is to diagnose accurately. \n\nThe mother's reaction was intense, but the doctor followed standard protocol. The patient (the teen) didn't seem to object, just looked scared. The mother's concerns might be about protecting her child's feelings, but the doctor's job is to provide necessary care. \n\nPossible angles: The doctor might not have been wrong, as they provided the standard care. However, could they have been more sensitive to the patient's gender identity? Maybe the approach could have been adjusted, but the procedure itself is necessary. Alternatively, the mother's refusal could lead to missing a critical diagnosis. \n\nIn medical ethics, the principle of beneficence (acting in the patient's best interest) is crucial here. The doctor followed that. The mother's refusal complicates things, but if the teen is a minor, the parents have the authority, but the doctor's job is to advise. The doctor isn't in the wrong for ordering the test; they can't force the family to proceed. \n\nSo, answer B: The doctor is not in the wrong. They followed protocol and tried to explain, even if the outcome was the family leaving.\n"
