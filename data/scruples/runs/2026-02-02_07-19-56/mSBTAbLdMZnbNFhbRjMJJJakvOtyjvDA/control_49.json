I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the ER doctor is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation involves a medical emergency where the standard diagnostic procedure might conflict with the patient's gender identity.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the medical context. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and accurate diagnosis is crucial. The doctor explains that a transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard because the patient's BMI made a transabdominal ultrasound less effective. The mom is upset because her son, who is undergoing testosterone treatment and identifies as male, is being subjected to a procedure that involves the female anatomy, which might trigger dysphoria.\n\nThe doctor tried to explain the necessity and how to minimize discomfort. The mom reacted strongly, feeling it's insensitive. The key points here are: Was the medical procedure appropriate? Did the doctor communicate effectively? And was there insensitivity towards the patient's gender identity?\n\nMedically, the transvaginal ultrasound is the standard for this case. The doctor did explain the procedure and its necessity. However, the patient is transgender, so the approach might need additional sensitivity. Maybe the doctor didn't consider alternatives or didn't involve the patient enough in the decision-making. The mom's reaction suggests that the procedure's nature clashed with their son's identity, causing distress.\n\nBut the doctor's priority is the patient's health. If the procedure is necessary and explained properly, the ethical obligation is to perform it. However, there's a balance between medical necessity and respecting the patient's comfort. The doctor might have failed to address the emotional aspect adequately, even if the procedure is correct. Perhaps there's a way to perform the ultrasound with more sensitivity, like using a different method if possible, or involving a provider who is more experienced with transgender patients.\n\nThe mom's reaction might be partly due to fear and misunderstanding. The doctor tried to explain the risks of a CT scan, which is valid. However, the mom felt the procedure was being forced, leading to a confrontation. It's possible the doctor should have explored more options for making the transvaginal ultrasound less distressing, like having a transgender-friendly provider or additional support for the patient.\n\nIn conclusion, while the doctor's medical decision was based on sound clinical reasoning, the execution might have lacked sufficient sensitivity to the patient's gender identity and the family's perspective. The answer isn't black and white, but the doctor could have done more to address the emotional impact, so maybe they're partially at fault. However, the primary responsibility is to the patient's health, so the doctor might not be entirely wrong.\n"
