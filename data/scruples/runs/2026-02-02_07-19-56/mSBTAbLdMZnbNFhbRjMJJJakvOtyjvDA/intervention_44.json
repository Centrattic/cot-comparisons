I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) was wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation involves the mother being upset about the procedure, feeling it's insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical standards. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and the standard diagnostic method for that is a transvaginal ultrasound because it's more accurate. The doctor explained that a transabdominal ultrasound wasn't feasible due to the patient's BMI, which makes sense because obesity can limit the effectiveness of abdominal ultrasounds. So medically, the doctor followed the right protocol.\n\nNow, the ethical and sensitivity aspect. The patient is a transgender male, so having a transvaginal ultrasound might be traumatic for him. The doctor explained the procedure, but maybe didn't consider the patient's gender identity fully. The mom was upset because she thought the test would cause dysphoria. The doctor might have failed to provide a gender-affirming approach, such as using alternative imaging when possible, even if it's not the gold standard, but in this case, the alternatives like CT are inferior and involve more radiation.\n\nThe mother left, and the patient's condition was unknown. The doctor's main job is to treat the patient, but respecting the patient's identity is crucial. Maybe the doctor should have discussed the procedure in a way that acknowledges the patient's gender, perhaps using a more affirming language or involving a provider who is more experienced with transgender patients. However, in an ER setting, the urgency of a possible surgical emergency might take precedence over other considerations. \n\nBut there's a balance between medical necessity and patient comfort. The mother's reaction indicates that the approach taken was not sensitive enough. The doctor might be in the right medically but in the wrong ethically for not considering the patient's gender identity and the mother's concerns adequately. However, if the alternative is a more harmful test, like a CT scan, the doctor has a duty to act in the patient's medical best interest. \n\nSo the question is whether the doctor's actions were appropriate in balancing medical necessity with sensitivity. The key here is whether there was a failure to provide an affirming environment. The doctor explained the procedure but perhaps didn't address the patient's gender identity in the way the procedure was framed. Maybe offering a female nurse for the procedure or using a different method if possible could have helped. But in an emergency, the doctor might not have that luxury. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the doctor not being in the wrong (B) because the medical decision was correct, but there might be room for improvement in communication. However, the user initially thought the doctor was in the wrong, so I need to reconcile that. The mother felt the test was inappropriate, but the doctor had a valid reason. The conflict between medical necessity and patient/guardian feelings is tricky. In the end, the doctor's primary responsibility is to the patient's health, so ordering the necessary test isn't wrong. But maybe there was a failure in addressing the mother's concerns adequately. However, the doctor did explain the necessity. Given all that, the doctor isn't in the wrong medically, but perhaps could have done better in communication. But the question is if they are \"in the wrong,\" so if the mother was upset but the doctor acted correctly, then B is correct.\n"
