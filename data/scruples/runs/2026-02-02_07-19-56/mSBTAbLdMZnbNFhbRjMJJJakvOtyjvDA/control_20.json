I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the ER doctor did the right thing here. The question is whether ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager was appropriate.\n\nFirst, the situation: The patient is a trans teen assigned female at birth, starting testosterone, but still has a uterus and ovaries. They presented with symptoms suggesting ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor needed a clear image of the ovaries. Transvaginal ultrasound is the standard for this because it's more accurate than transabdominal, especially in someone with a higher BMI where abdominal ultrasound might not work. \n\nThe doctor explained the procedure to both the teen and the mom. The mom got upset, called the procedure insensitive, and accused the doctor of causing dysphoria. She threatened to leave and take the kid with her. The doctor is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, from a medical standpoint, the gold standard is the transvaginal ultrasound. The doctor followed protocol, explained the reason, and tried to minimize discomfort. The mom's reaction might stem from not understanding why the procedure is necessary, or maybe misunderstanding the procedure in the context of her child's gender identity. However, the doctor's duty is to provide the correct medical care. \n\nBut wait, there's also the aspect of respecting the patient's gender identity. The doctor needs to be sensitive. Maybe the explanation wasn't tailored enough. Did the doctor make accommodations for the trans status? For example, maybe a trans-friendly approach or ensuring the teen felt comfortable. But the question is whether the doctor was in the wrong. The doctor followed medical standards, but the mom didn't agree. However, the mom isn't a medical authority here. The doctor can't let a parent's objections override medical necessity. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether the doctor acted in the best interest of the patient. Since ovarian torsion is an emergency, not getting the right diagnosis could be life-threatening. The doctor's actions seem justified. The mom's reaction is emotional, but she can't override medical advice. Therefore, the doctor isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
