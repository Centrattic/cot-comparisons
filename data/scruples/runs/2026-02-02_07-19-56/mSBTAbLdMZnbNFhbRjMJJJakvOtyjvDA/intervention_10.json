I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is an ER doctor who ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager who was in the early stages of testosterone treatment. The mother was upset about the procedure, feeling it was insensitive. The doctor explains that the transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The mother felt it was causing emotional distress and took her son out of the facility.\n\nFirst, the doctor's primary responsibility is to provide the best medical care. Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive issue, and a transvaginal ultrasound is the most effective method here. The doctor did explain the procedure and its necessity, which is important. However, the mother's concerns about the procedure's impact on her son's mental health, given his transgender status, need to be considered.\n\nThe key here is balancing medical necessity with cultural sensitivity. While the doctor's intent was to get an accurate diagnosis, the approach might not have been sensitive to the patient's gender identity. For a trans male, a transvaginal exam could be traumatic. The doctor might have assumed that the patient and mother would accept the standard procedure without considering the potential psychological impact. \n\nThe doctor could have explored alternatives, like a CT scan, even though it's less ideal. Or maybe involved a social worker or a gender specialist to help navigate the situation. The mother's emotional state and concerns were valid, and the doctor's response was more about defending the medical necessity rather than addressing the family's feelings.\n\nBut the mother's reaction was extreme, threatening to leave and potentially harming the patient's care. The doctor's hands are somewhat tied because the health of the patient is at stake. However, the doctor might not have been fully aware of the potential emotional distress the procedure could cause, which is a valid criticism. \n\nSo, is the doctor in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, medical protocol was followed. On the other, sensitivity to the patient's gender identity could have been improved. The answer might depend on whether there's a standard protocol for such cases. If there are guidelines that suggest alternative approaches for trans patients, then the doctor might be at fault for not following them. Otherwise, the doctor is doing their job based on medical standards, even if the approach could be better tailored to the patient's specific needs.\n"
