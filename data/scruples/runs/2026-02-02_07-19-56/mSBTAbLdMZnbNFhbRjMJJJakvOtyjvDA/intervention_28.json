I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a doctor ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender teenage boy who's on testosterone but still has a uterus and ovaries. The mom is upset, and they left the ER before the test was done.\n\nSo the question is whether the doctor is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the medical context: the patient is a trans male with a uterus. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency. The standard diagnostic method for that is a transvaginal ultrasound because it's more accurate, especially when a transabdominal ultrasound isn't feasible due to BMI. The doctor explained the need, but the mom refused and took the kid out. \n\nNow, the ethical considerations. The doctor's duty is to provide necessary medical care. But the patient is a minor, so the doctor has to balance parental rights and the child's autonomy. The mom is the legal guardian, so she has the authority, but the child is the one receiving care. The doctor tried to explain the necessity but the mom still refused. \n\nThe key points here might be whether the doctor considered the child's gender identity and if there were alternatives. Transvaginal ultrasound could be distressing for a trans male. Maybe there was a way to perform the test with sensitivity, like having a provider of the same gender or ensuring privacy. Did the doctor offer any accommodations? The description says they explained it in common terms and would reduce discomfort, but maybe that wasn't enough. \n\nAnother angle: the mom is upset because the procedure is gender-inappropriate for her son. The doctor might have failed to acknowledge the emotional impact on the patient. Even if the test is necessary, the method should respect the patient's identity. Perhaps there's a way to approach it without causing dysphoria, but in emergencies, the priority is the health. \n\nBut the doctor followed standard practice. The issue is whether the standard procedure is appropriate for a transgender patient. Medical guidelines might support the necessity of the test regardless of gender identity, but the delivery could be more considerate. Did the doctor account for the patient's comfort and identity? If they didn't offer alternatives or ensure the procedure was handled with care for the patient's gender, maybe they were insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's refusal might be based on her understanding of her child's needs, but the doctor has a duty to the patient's health. The doctor can't force the test, but should they have explored other options? Maybe there's a compromise, like a different provider or a more private setting. \n\nIn summary, the doctor might not be in the wrong medically, but perhaps ethically there's room for improvement in handling transgender patients' needs. However, without more info on alternatives explored, it's hard to say. The key is whether the standard procedure was inconsiderate. If the doctor followed protocol but didn't adjust for the patient's gender identity, they might be at fault. But if there's no alternative to the transvaginal ultrasound for this diagnosis, then the doctor is doing their job.\n"
