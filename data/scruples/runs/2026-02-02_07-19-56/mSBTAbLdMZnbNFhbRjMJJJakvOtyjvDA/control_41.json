I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the ER doctor who ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager was in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe patient is a trans teen starting testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. He presented with symptoms of ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor wanted to do a transvaginal ultrasound, which is the standard for this condition, especially when a transabdominal ultrasound isn't feasible due to BMI. The mother objected, saying it's inappropriate and causing distress, leading her to leave with the kid.\n\nSo, the doctor's perspective is that they're following the standard medical protocol to diagnose a serious condition. They explained the procedure, and the kid understood. The mother was upset, but the doctor didn't force anything. The threat here is the mom threatening to leave and possibly take her son out of the hospital. \n\nNow, considering the patient's rights and the healthcare provider's obligations. The doctor had a duty to provide necessary medical care. They presented the best diagnostic option. However, the patient is a minor, so the parent's consent is usually required. But if the parent is refusing, does that create an ethical dilemma? Also, the doctor needs to balance the patient's health against their comfort.\n\nBut in this case, the doctor didn't force the procedure. They explained the options, and the mother decided to leave. The doctor can't force a parent to allow the procedure unless it's an emergency. Since the patient is a minor, the parent's consent is needed. However, if the parent is withholding consent despite a medical necessity, the hospital might have to involve child protective services, but that's a legal step.\n\nBut the doctor's role is to recommend the best care. They did that. The mother chose not to comply. The doctor isn't in the wrong because they followed protocol and explained the situation. The mother's reaction is understandable due to the child's gender identity, but the medical need is there. So the doctor did what's right medically, even if it caused tension. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
