I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the ER doctor is at fault here. The situation involves a transgender male teenager who's undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. The doctor ordered a transvaginal ultrasound because a transabdominal one wasn't feasible due to the patient's BMI, and the mother objected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical necessity. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so getting an accurate diagnosis is critical. The transvaginal ultrasound is the standard procedure when a transabdominal isn't possible. The doctor explained the procedure and the alternatives, like a CT scan, but the mother still refused. \n\nThe mother's reaction might stem from her concerns about her child's gender identity. She might feel that the procedure is inappropriate or could cause distress. However, the doctor's primary duty is to provide the best medical care based on evidence-based practices. The procedure itself is a standard diagnostic tool, regardless of the patient's gender identity. \n\nThe doctor didn't force the procedure but tried to communicate the necessity. The mother's threat to leave and the emotional response might be due to her own anxiety or misunderstanding. The key is whether the doctor acted unreasonably or insensitively. The doctor explained the procedure in common terms, which shows effort to be clear and considerate. \n\nThere's a balance between respect for the patient's identity and medical needs. The doctor's actions seem to be in line with professional standards. So, the answer is likely B (not at fault). But I need to check if there's any aspect where the doctor could have done more to accommodate the patient's gender identity. The doctor mentioned reducing discomfort, which is good. Transvaginal ultrasound might be sensitive, but it's still necessary for diagnosis. \n\nNo signs of discrimination or insensitivity from the doctor's side. The mother's reaction is understandable but doesn't override the medical necessity. So, the doctor isn't in the wrong here.\n"
