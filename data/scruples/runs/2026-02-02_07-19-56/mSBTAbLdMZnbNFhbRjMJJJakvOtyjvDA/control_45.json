I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The teenager is undergoing testosterone treatment as part of their transition to male, but anatomically still has a uterus and ovaries. They presented with symptoms suggesting ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The ER doctor wanted a transvaginal ultrasound for a better view, as a transabdominal ultrasound wasn't feasible due to the patient's BMI.\n\nThe mom got upset, thinking it's inappropriate for her son. The doctor explained the necessity, but the mom left with the teen, threatening to leave the hospital. Now, the question is if the doctor did something wrong.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, the doctor followed the standard procedure. Ovarian torsion needs accurate diagnosis quickly. A transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard here because it provides clearer images, especially when transabdominal isn't possible. So medically, the doctor was correct in the choice.\n\nBut considering the patient's identity as a transgender male might raise concerns. The mom felt it was insensitive. The doctor explained the procedure in common terms and aimed to minimize discomfort. However, the procedure itself involves inserting a probe into the vagina, which could be distressing for someone who identifies as male. The doctor might have considered alternative approaches to make the patient more comfortable, like using a different naming convention for the procedure or ensuring the patient's consent and understanding were fully addressed, especially given their gender identity.\n\nThe key here is balancing medical necessity with sensitivity to the patient's gender identity. The doctor might have been technically correct in the medical decision but could have failed to address the emotional and psychological aspects. Maybe there was a lack of communication about how to proceed respectfully, considering the patient's gender identity. The mom's reaction suggests that there was a breakdown in communication or empathy.\n\nHowever, the doctor's primary duty is to provide the best possible medical care. If the transvaginal ultrasound is necessary, the doctor isn't wrong in ordering it. But in handling the situation, there might have been a lack of sensitivity. The question is whether the doctor is in the wrong for the medical decision or the way it was handled.\n\nIn terms of medical ethics, the principle of beneficence (acting in the patient's best interest) is crucial. However, non-maleficence (do no harm) also includes psychological harm. The doctor might have prioritized the physical health but overlooked potential emotional harm. \n\nBut in this case, the doctor explained the procedure and the necessity, which is part of informed consent. The mother's reaction was extreme, but the doctor's intention was to provide appropriate care. The mom's belief that the test would cause dysphoria might be a valid concern, but the doctor's responsibility is to follow medical standards unless there's a valid alternative.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the doctor isn't in the wrong for ordering the necessary test. However, there's room for improvement in communication and sensitivity. But based on the scenario, the answer would be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for the medical decision, though maybe the approach could have been more empathetic.\n"
