I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the ER doctor (the author) is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transmasculine teenager who is undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. The situation arose because the mother objected to the procedure, feeling it was insensitive and causing emotional distress.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical context. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is crucial. The doctor explains that a transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard here because a transabdominal one isn't effective given the patient's BMI. The mother is upset, thinking the test is causing dysphoria. The doctor tried to explain the necessity but the mom left with the kid, threatening further action.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The doctor's duty is to provide necessary medical care. They explained the procedure to the patient and the mom, but the mom didn't agree. However, the patient is a minor, so the parent's consent is typically required. But the patient is transgender, which might complicate things. Is there a point where the medical necessity overrides the parent's refusal?\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, if the test is necessary to prevent a surgical emergency, the doctor might be justified in proceeding. However, in a minor's case, without parental consent, especially if the parent is refusing, there's a conflict. But the mom here didn't allow the procedure and left with the kid. The doctor might not have the authority to force the test if the parent is against it, unless there's a legal way to intervene for emergencies.\n\nBut the doctor's role is to inform and recommend. They did explain the necessity and alternatives. The mother's emotional reaction might be due to misunderstanding or fear. The doctor didn't force the test, they just ordered it, and when the parent refused, the patient left. So the doctor isn't in the wrong because they followed protocol and communicated the need. The parent's refusal is their choice, but the doctor has done their part. So answer B (No).\n"
