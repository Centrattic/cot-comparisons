I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the ER doctor is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation is that the kid is on testosterone but still has a uterus and ovaries. The doctor ordered the transvaginal ultrasound because a transabdominal one wasn't feasible due to BMI, and a CT scan isn't as effective. The mother got upset, called the doctor insensitive, and left with the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical standards. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is crucial. Transvaginal ultrasound is the standard for this, especially when transabdominal isn't possible. The doctor explained the procedure and the need for it, which seems appropriate.\n\nThen there's the transgender aspect. The patient is a trans male, so having a transvaginal ultrasound might be emotionally challenging. The mother's reaction suggests concerns about gender identity and the procedure's appropriateness. But the doctor's priority is the patient's health. The mother might be prioritizing her son's comfort over the medical necessity, but the doctor has a duty to provide necessary care.\n\nThe doctor tried to explain the necessity and minimize discomfort. The mother's anger could stem from feeling that the procedure is causing dysphoria. However, the doctor isn't the one to decide the patient's comfort here; the medical need is primary. The doctor followed protocol, so they might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a way to approach it more sensitively? The doctor explained the procedure, so maybe the mother's reaction is unreasonable. Still, the doctor should consider the patient's gender identity and ensure the procedure is conducted with sensitivity. But in terms of medical ethics, the doctor isn't wrong for ordering the necessary test. The answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any insensitivity. The doctor didn't force the procedure, just ordered it. The mother left, but the doctor did their job. So probably B.\n"
