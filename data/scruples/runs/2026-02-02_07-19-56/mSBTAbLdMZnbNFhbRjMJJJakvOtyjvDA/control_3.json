I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the ER doctor who ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager was in the wrong. The doctor explained that the procedure was necessary for diagnosing ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The mother was upset because she felt it was insensitive. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical necessity. Ovarian torsion is a serious condition that requires timely diagnosis. The doctor mentioned that a transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard here because the patient's BMI made a transabdominal ultrasound less effective. So from a medical standpoint, the procedure was appropriate to ensure accurate diagnosis and prevent harm.\n\nNext, the patient is a transgender male, which means he identifies as male but still has female anatomy, including a uterus and ovaries since he's in early testosterone treatment. The doctor explained the procedure clearly to the patient, who understood but was scared. The mother's objection seems to be about the procedure's sensitivity given the patient's gender identity. She accused the doctor of causing emotional distress and sexual dysphoria.\n\nThe doctor's responsibility is to provide necessary medical care. While respecting the patient's gender identity is important, the medical standard of care must also be upheld. The doctor tried to explain the necessity and how to minimize discomfort, which shows they were trying to be considerate. The mother's reaction was extreme, even threatening to leave and threatening staff. \n\nThe key points here are whether the doctor acted within medical standards and whether they were respectful. Since the procedure was medically necessary and the doctor communicated properly, it's unlikely they were in the wrong. The mother's opposition was based on emotional concerns rather than medical facts. The doctor isn't obligated to ignore medical best practices to avoid causing temporary discomfort if it's necessary for the patient's health. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
