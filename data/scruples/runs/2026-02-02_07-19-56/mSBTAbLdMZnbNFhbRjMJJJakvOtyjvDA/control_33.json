I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical context. Ovarian torsion is a serious condition where the ovary twists, cutting off blood supply, which is a surgical emergency. The standard diagnostic method for this is a transvaginal ultrasound because it's more accurate than other methods, especially in overweight patients where transabdominal might not be as effective. The doctor explained the procedure to the patient and mom, but the mom refused and left.\n\nNow, the key points are: The doctor followed medical guidelines by ordering the most appropriate test. They explained the procedure clearly and considered the patient's comfort. But the mother felt it was insensitive. The patient is a transgender male, so the procedure might be uncomfortable or conflicting with their identity. However, the doctor's priority is to diagnose a potential emergency. \n\nI need to consider if there's a way to balance medical necessity with the patient's gender identity. The doctor might not have been aware of the patient's specific needs regarding gender dysphoria. Maybe there was a lack of sensitivity in how the procedure was explained or offered alternatives, but the doctor did state they would reduce discomfort. \n\nThe mom's reaction suggests she felt the test was inappropriate. However, the doctor had no other way to accurately assess the emergency. Medical professionals are supposed to prioritize the patient's health, even if it leads to some discomfort. The threat from the mom and the refusal might be on her side, but the doctor's actions were based on medical necessity. \n\nSo, the doctor isn't in the wrong because they followed standard protocol for a life-threatening condition. They tried to explain the procedure and its importance. The mother's refusal doesn't negate the medical need. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
