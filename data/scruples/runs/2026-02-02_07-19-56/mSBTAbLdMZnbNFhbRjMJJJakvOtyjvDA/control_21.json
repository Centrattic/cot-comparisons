I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the ER doctor who ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager was in the wrong. The situation involves a parent getting upset about the procedure.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the scenario. The patient is a trans male in the early stages of testosterone therapy. He presented with symptoms of ovarian torsion. The doctor decided a transvaginal ultrasound was necessary because the transabdominal ultrasound wasn't feasible due to the patient's BMI. The mother was upset, accused the doctor of being insensitive and causing dysphoria, and then left with the kid. The doctor is questioning if they were at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: medical necessity, patient's gender identity, parent's reaction. The doctor's duty is to provide the best care, which in this case, the transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing ovarian torsion. The patient is transgender but still has the anatomy that could be at risk here. \n\nI need to consider if the doctor was respectful. The doctor explained the procedure, understood the patient's anatomy, and tried to make them comfortable. The mother's issue seems to be about the procedure's sensitivity to the child's gender identity. But from a medical standpoint, the procedure is necessary regardless of the patient's gender identity because the anatomy is still present.\n\nThe doctor isn't forcing the procedure without consent. The mother and patient were informed. The mother's reaction might stem from her own discomfort with the procedure in relation to her son's identity, but the doctor can't compromise medical standards based on that. \n\nThe threat of the mother leaving and threatening the staff complicates things, but the doctor's responsibility is to the patient's health. The mother's actions might be overstepping, but the doctor did their job correctly. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the doctor is not in the wrong) because they made a medically appropriate decision based on the patient's condition and standard protocol. The parent's disagreement doesn't override the medical necessity here.\n"
