I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation is a bit complex because it involves medical decision-making and the family's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical context. The patient is a trans male teen undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. The presenting issue is possible ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The standard diagnostic for this is a transvaginal ultrasound because it provides clearer images than a transabdominal one, especially in someone with a higher BMI. The doctor explained the procedure to the patient and the mother, but the mother was upset and took the patient out, threatening to leave.\n\nNow, considering the doctor's role, their primary duty is to provide the best possible care for the patient. Ovarian torsion is time-sensitive, so a correct diagnosis is crucial. The transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard here. The doctor didn't force the procedure; they explained it and the mother refused. However, the patient's well-being comes first, and the doctor can't be expected to cater to the family's discomfort if it compromises medical care.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of sensitivity towards the patient's gender identity. A trans male might feel uncomfortable with a procedure that's typically associated with female anatomy. The doctor did explain the procedure, so they might have tried to be understanding. The mother's reaction seems to be a conflict between her beliefs and the medical necessity. The doctor isn't responsible for the mother's emotional response if they followed medical guidelines and communicated properly.\n\nThe key points are: medical necessity, communication, and patient autonomy. The doctor followed the standard protocol, communicated the need, and the refusal was from the parent. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation, the doctor isn't at fault. However, maybe there's a way to be more sensitive, but in an emergency, the priority is the patient's health. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
