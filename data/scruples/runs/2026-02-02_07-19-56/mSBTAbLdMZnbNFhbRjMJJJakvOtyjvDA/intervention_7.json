I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the ER doctor made a mistake by ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The doctor explained the necessity due to the medical condition, but the mother strongly objected, leading to the family leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical standards. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing it when transabdominal isn't feasible. The doctor mentioned the patient's BMI made transabdominal difficult, so the transvaginal approach was appropriate. That seems medically sound.\n\nNext, the patient's gender identity. The teen is on testosterone but still has a uterus and ovaries. The doctor had to assess the correct anatomy. However, the mother felt the procedure was insensitive. Transgender individuals often have complex needs, and respecting their identity is crucial. The doctor tried to explain the procedure, but maybe didn't consider the emotional impact on the teen. \n\nThe mother's reaction was intense, and she felt the test would cause emotional distress. The doctor might have failed to adequately address the family's concerns. While the medical decision was correct, the approach might lack sensitivity. The patient's comfort and understanding are important. The doctor should balance medical necessity with empathy, perhaps offering alternatives if possible. But in an ER, time is critical. \n\nSo, is the doctor wrong? The medical decision was correct, but maybe the communication could have been better. They explained the procedure but perhaps didn't acknowledge the family's perspective enough. It's a tough balance between urgency and sensitivity. The doctor isn't in the wrong medically, but might have handled the communication poorly. So the answer is B (No), but with a note about considering the patient's identity more carefully.\n"
