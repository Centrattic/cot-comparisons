I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the ER doctor is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager.\n\nFirst, the medical situation: The patient is a trans male in early testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. The main issue is possible ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor needed a clear view of the ovaries. Transabdominal ultrasound isn't effective due to the patient's BMI, so a transvaginal ultrasound is necessary for accurate diagnosis. The mom is upset, thinking it's insensitive. The doctor explained the need, but the mom was angry and left.\n\nNow, considering medical ethics. The doctor's priority is to provide appropriate care. A transvaginal ultrasound is the standard for this condition when transabdominal isn't feasible. The doctor explained the procedure to the patient and mom, which is part of informed consent. The doctor isn't forcing the mom; they're offering the best diagnostic method. The mom's concerns might relate to the patient's gender identity, but the procedure is necessary regardless. The doctor isn't making a judgment about the patient's identity but using standard medical practice. The mom's emotional reaction doesn't negate the medical need. The doctor's actions are in line with their duty to treat the patient, regardless of family pushback. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
