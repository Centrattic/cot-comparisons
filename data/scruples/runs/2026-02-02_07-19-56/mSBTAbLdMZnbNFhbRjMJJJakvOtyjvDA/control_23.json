I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the patient is a teenager undergoing testosterone treatment for gender transition, still retaining a uterus and ovaries. The presenting issue is suspected ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor chose a transvaginal ultrasound as the gold standard for this condition because a transabdominal ultrasound wasn't feasible due to the patient's BMI. They explained the procedure to both the patient and the mother, but the mother became extremely upset and left with the patient.\n\nNow, the key points here are medical necessity and sensitivity towards the patient's gender identity. The doctor's main concern is diagnosing a potentially life-threatening condition accurately. Transvaginal ultrasound is the best method here, so from a medical standpoint, the order seems justified. However, the mother's reaction suggests she felt this procedure was inappropriate given her son's gender identity, which raises ethical and sensitivity issues.\n\nThe doctor tried to explain the necessity but the mother perceived it as insensitive. The challenge here is balancing medical protocol with the patient's gender identity. The doctor might not have considered the patient's gender transition in their explanation, leading to the mother's discomfort. Transgender patients often face medical situations where procedures can conflict with their gender identity, causing distress. Proper communication and understanding of the patient's background could mitigate such issues.\n\nWas the doctor wrong? It's a tough call. Medically, the procedure was appropriate. But ethically, maybe there's room for improvement in how the procedure was explained, considering the patient's gender identity. The doctor should have been more proactive in addressing the patient's and mother's concerns about the procedure's impact on the patient's mental state. However, the doctor's primary duty is to the patient's health, so refusing the necessary test could be negligent. \n\nSo, the doctor isn't in the wrong for ordering the test, but could have handled the communication better. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
