I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a trans teen. The situation involves a teenage patient who's undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. They came in with possible ovarian torsion, which is an emergency.\n\nThe doctor ordered a transvaginal ultrasound because the transabdominal one wasn't feasible due to BMI. The mom got upset, thinking it's insensitive. The doctor explained it's the gold standard and that a CT isn't suitable. The mom then left with her son, threatening to take action.\n\nSo, the key points here are: medical necessity vs. the mother's concerns about sensitivity. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so timely diagnosis is crucial. The transvaginal ultrasound is the standard method for this condition when transabdominal isn't effective. The doctor explained the procedure and the need, but the mom refused. The patient is a minor, so the parents have decision-making authority. But the patient might also have their own consent if they're of age. However, the situation is complicated by the parent's objections.\n\nThe doctor's responsibility is to provide the best care based on medical standards. They didn't force the procedure, but they recommended the standard test. The mom's concerns are about the child's gender identity and potential emotional distress. Transvaginal ultrasounds can be a sensitive issue for trans males, but medically necessary procedures shouldn't be denied due to gender identity concerns. However, the doctor has to balance that with respecting the family's wishes if they refuse.\n\nThe question is whether the doctor was wrong in ordering the test. The doctor followed protocol, explained the reasons, and tried to be sensitive. The mom's reaction was extreme, but does that make the doctor wrong? The doctor's actions were based on medical necessity, so they can't be blamed for advocating for the appropriate test. The mother's refusal might be influenced by her own biases against the child's transition, but the doctor isn't responsible for the parent's reaction. Therefore, the doctor isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
