I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the ER doctor is at fault for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe patient is a trans male teen undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. He presented with symptoms suggesting ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The ER doctor ordered a transvaginal ultrasound because the transabdominal one wasn't feasible due to the patient's BMI. The mother was upset, feeling the procedure was insensitive, and they left the ER.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical standards. Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive issue, and accurate diagnosis is crucial. Transvaginal ultrasounds are the gold standard here because they provide clearer images. The doctor explained this to the mother but she was resistant. The doctor's priority is the patient's health, but the mother's concerns about the patient's gender identity and potential dysphoria are valid from their perspective.\n\nTransgender patients often face challenges with medical procedures that involve their anatomy that doesn't align with their gender. The mother might believe that a transvaginal exam could be traumatic for her son, causing emotional distress. The doctor, however, had a duty to ensure the correct diagnosis. The question is whether the doctor acted inappropriately despite the mother's objections.\n\nI need to check if there were alternative methods. The mother suggested a CT scan, but the doctor rightly pointed out that CT isn't as effective and involves more radiation. So there's a medical necessity here. The doctor didn't force the procedure but tried to explain the necessity. The mother's reaction was extreme, but the doctor's actions were based on clinical judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, the doctor might not have considered the patient's gender identity sufficiently. Maybe a more sensitive approach could have been taken, like involving a transgender-sensitive medical team or providing additional support during the exam. However, the doctor did explain the procedure in common terms and aimed to reduce discomfort. The patient himself understood and was scared but okay with it, while the mother was the one objecting.\n\nThe key points are: medical necessity vs. patient/parent's emotional concerns. The doctor followed standard protocol. However, the mother's perspective highlights the importance of cultural competency in healthcare, especially regarding transgender patients. The doctor might have failed to adequately address the mother's concerns about her son's gender identity, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the doctor at fault? The doctor acted in the patient's medical interest, but perhaps could have been more empathetic to the mother's concerns. However, the decision to order the necessary test wasn't inherently wrong. The mother's refusal led to the patient leaving against medical advice, which is a complex situation. The doctor can't be blamed for adhering to medical standards, even if the outcome was negative because the patient left.\n"
