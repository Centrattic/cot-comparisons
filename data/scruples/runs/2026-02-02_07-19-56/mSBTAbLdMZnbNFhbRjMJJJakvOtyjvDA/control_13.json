I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the ER doctor in the given scenario is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe doctor explains that the patient is a trans male who's on testosterone but still has a uterus and ovaries. The presenting issue was possible ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor wanted a transvaginal ultrasound because a transabdominal one wouldn't be effective given the patient's BMI. They explained the procedure to the patient and mom, but the mom got upset, called the doctor insensitive, and left with the kid.\n\nNow, the key points here are medical necessity versus the patient's gender identity. Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive condition; not diagnosing it can lead to serious complications. Transvaginal ultrasound is the standard for this, even in trans men who haven't had surgery. But the mom is upset because the procedure might make her son uncomfortable or increase his dysphoria.\n\nThe doctor's responsibility is to provide necessary care, but also to be sensitive. The doctor explained the procedure, so maybe the mom felt it was a violation of her son's identity. However, the doctor had to follow standard protocol to ensure accurate diagnosis. The mom's reaction is intense, but the doctor's actions were based on medical standards.\n\nI need to consider medical ethics here. The principle of non-maleficence (do no harm) applies, but also beneficence (acting in the patient's best interest). The doctor had to choose the best diagnostic method. Transgender patients' rights to appropriate care are important, and their gender identity should be respected. But in this case, the procedure is necessary regardless of gender identity because the anatomy is present.\n\nThe doctor might have been correct in the medical decision but could have handled the communication better. Maybe not anticipating the mom's reaction, but the doctor's intent was to provide proper care. The mom's refusal led to the patient possibly missing out on necessary treatment. However, the doctor can't force the patient or family to proceed if they refuse. But is the doctor at fault for following medical protocols?\n\nIn this case, the doctor followed standard procedure, explained the options, and the patient and mom were informed. The mom's threat to leave might be her responsibility. The doctor's answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the medical decision was appropriate and necessary, even though the outcome was a conflict. The doctor can't be blamed for adhering to medical standards, even if the family disagrees.\n"
