I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The teenager is undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. He presented with symptoms suggesting ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor wanted to do a transvaginal ultrasound, which is the standard for this condition, but the mother objected, feeling it was insensitive and causing dysphoria.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the conflict between medical necessity and the mother's concerns regarding her child's transgender identity. The doctor's job is to provide the best medical care, and the standard procedure for ovarian torsion is a transvaginal ultrasound. However, the mother is upset because the procedure might be uncomfortable or distressing for her son, who identifies as male.\n\nI should consider the ethical guidelines for treating transgender patients. Doctors are supposed to be sensitive to patients' gender identities. However, in an emergency, the primary concern is the patient's physical health. Ovarian torsion can lead to severe complications if not treated promptly, so delaying diagnosis isn't an option. The doctor explained the procedure and the necessity, which shows they tried to be communicative. \n\nBut maybe the doctor didn't consider alternative methods that respect the patient's gender identity. For instance, could they have used another imaging technique or involved a transgender-friendly staff member to perform the ultrasound? However, the doctor mentioned that a CT isn't suitable here. So, the alternatives might be limited.\n\nThe mother's reaction seems extreme, but her concern is about her child's emotional well-being. The doctor might be caught between two responsibilities: providing urgent medical care and respecting the patient's identity. The key here is whether the doctor acted in the best interest of the patient's health while being as sensitive as possible. \n\nIn medical ethics, the principle of beneficence (doing good) and non-maleficence (do no harm) are crucial. The doctor's intention was to prevent harm from a possible surgical emergency, which is a valid reason. However, causing psychological distress could be seen as another form of harm. \n\nIt's also important to consider the patient's autonomy. The teenager, depending on his age, might have the right to consent to the procedure. The mother's refusal to allow the test could be against the child's medical needs. But since it's a minor, the parents usually have the authority, unless the situation is an emergency where the child's life is at risk. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, if a minor is in a life-threatening situation and the parents refuse consent, the medical team can proceed under the doctrine of implied consent. However, the scenario here doesn't mention the child being in immediate danger, just concerning symptoms. \n\nThe doctor tried to explain the necessity and reduce discomfort, which is appropriate. The mother's hostility might be due to misunderstanding or strong feelings about her child's treatment. The doctor isn't in the wrong for following medical standards unless there was a failure to accommodate the patient's gender identity in a respectful way. \n\nSo, the doctor acted appropriately by choosing the standard diagnostic test and explaining it. The mother's objections, while concerning, don't necessarily make the doctor wrong. The doctor's responsibility is to the patient's physical health, especially in a potential emergency. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
