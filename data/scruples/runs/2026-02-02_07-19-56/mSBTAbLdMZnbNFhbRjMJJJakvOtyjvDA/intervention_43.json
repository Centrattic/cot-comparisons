I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a transmasculine teenager comes into the ER with possible ovarian torsion. The doctor orders a transvaginal ultrasound, which the mom objects to because it's not appropriate for her son. The doctor explains that it's the gold standard for diagnosis but the mom is upset and leaves with the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical necessity. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is critical. The transvaginal ultrasound is the best method here because the patient's BMI makes a transabdominal ultrasound less effective. The doctor explained the procedure and the reasons for it, right? So from a medical standpoint, the doctor is doing what's necessary to prevent missing a serious condition.\n\nBut the mom is objecting, saying it's causing emotional turmoil and dysphoria. The kid is trans, so undergoing a procedure that's typically associated with female anatomy might be distressing. The doctor might not have considered the patient's gender identity in how the procedure is approached. Maybe there's a way to perform the exam that's more affirming. For example, using the correct terminology, ensuring the patient's comfort, maybe having a trans-friendly environment. Did the doctor address the patient directly or just explain to the mom? The mom might feel protective, but the patient is a teenager who might have the right to consent. However, minors can't typically consent on their own, so the parent's input is part of the process.\n\nThe doctor's approach might have been technically correct but lacked sensitivity. The mom's reaction is intense, and the nurses were threatened. The doctor should balance medical necessity with the patient's and family's emotional state. Maybe there's a way to explain the procedure in a more gender-affirming manner, perhaps using the patient's pronouns, ensuring privacy, or having a support person present. Did the doctor consider alternative methods if the family was uncomfortable? The mom suggested a CT scan, which the doctor rejected because it's not as effective and has higher radiation. But maybe the doctor could have proposed a different approach that's still safe but less invasive in terms of the patient's comfort. \n\nIn trans healthcare, cultural competency is crucial. The doctor might not have been aware of the potential impact of the procedure on the patient's gender dysphoria. Even if the procedure is necessary, the way it's communicated can make a difference. The doctor should ensure that the patient feels respected and that their gender identity is acknowledged. If the mom was so upset, maybe involving another provider who is more experienced with transgender patients could help mediate. \n\nSo, the doctor's decision was medically sound, but perhaps the execution lacked the necessary sensitivity. The key issue is whether the doctor considered the patient's gender identity in the care provided. If the doctor had taken steps to be more affirming, maybe the mom's reaction would have been different. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong not for the medical decision but for not addressing the emotional and identity aspects adequately.\n"
