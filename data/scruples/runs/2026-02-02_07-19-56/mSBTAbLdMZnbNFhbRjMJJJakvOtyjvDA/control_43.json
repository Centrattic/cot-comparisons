I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the ER doctor who ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager was in the wrong. The situation involves a medical emergency where the patient has a uterus and ovaries, and the doctor believes a transvaginal ultrasound is necessary for accurate diagnosis.\n\nFirst, the doctor's main concern is diagnosing ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. They explain that a transabdominal ultrasound isn't feasible due to the patient's BMI, making the transvaginal approach the gold standard. The mother objects, feeling it's insensitive to her son's gender identity. The doctor stands by the medical necessity, but the mom leaves with the kid, possibly risking the patient's health.\n\nNow, considering medical ethics: the doctor has a duty to provide the best care, even if it causes some discomfort. However, they also need to respect the patient's autonomy and cultural considerations. The patient is a teenager, so their consent and comfort are important. The doctor explained the procedure, which is a good step. The mother's reaction is intense, but the doctor's actions were based on clinical judgment. \n\nBut wait, the patient is transgender, so using a transvaginal ultrasound might be distressing. The doctor should have considered alternative methods or discussed the procedure more thoroughly with both the patient and parent, maybe offering options to minimize discomfort or trauma. However, in an ER setting, time constraints and the urgency of a possible surgical emergency might limit that. \n\nThe key here is balancing medical necessity with patient sensitivity. The doctor followed protocol, but perhaps didn't fully address the patient's gender identity in the approach. Maybe there's a way to perform the ultrasound while respecting the patient's gender expression, like having a same-gender provider or providing a chaperone. But the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nIn the end, the doctor's primary responsibility is to the patient's health. If the ultrasound was the only way to get an accurate diagnosis, then they're not in the wrong. However, if there were other options or if the approach caused unnecessary distress without medical benefit, that's different. Since the doctor explained the procedure and the necessity, and the mother still refused, it's a tough call. But the doctor isn't at fault for following standard medical practice.\n"
