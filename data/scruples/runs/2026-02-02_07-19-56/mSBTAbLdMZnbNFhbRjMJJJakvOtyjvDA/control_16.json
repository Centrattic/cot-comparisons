I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the ER doctor is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. Let me start by going through the details.\n\nFirst, the context: The patient is a teenage trans guy in the early stages of testosterone treatment. He still has a uterus and ovaries, so anatomically female in that aspect. He came in with possible ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The ER doctor ordered a transvaginal ultrasound because the transabdominal one isn't feasible due to the patient's BMI. The mom got upset and left with the kid, threatening the hospital.\n\nThe doctor explained that transvaginal is the gold standard for this situation, and that a CT scan isn't suitable because of radiation and lower diagnostic accuracy. The mom felt it was insensitive and that the tests would cause emotional distress, implying it's being used to trigger dysphoria. The doctor didn't force the procedure, and the mom left with the patient, so the issue is whether the doctor erred in ordering the test.\n\nSo, medical standards matter here. Ovarian torsion is serious, and timely diagnosis is crucial. Transvaginal ultrasound is more accurate, especially when transabdominal isn't possible. The doctor followed protocol, explained the procedure, and considered the patient's needs. The mom's objection is about the method, but the doctor's priority is the patient's health. The patient's gender identity doesn't change the need for the test if the anatomy requires it. The doctor didn't ignore the parent's concerns but stood by the medical necessity. The mom's reaction seems to be about the method conflicting with the child's identity, but the doctor isn't in the wrong here because the test is necessary regardless of the patient's gender identity. The doctor tried to be sensitive but had to prioritize medical care. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
