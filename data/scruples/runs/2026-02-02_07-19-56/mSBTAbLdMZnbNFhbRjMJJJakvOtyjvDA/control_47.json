I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the ER doctor is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation involves a medical emergency\u2014ovarian torsion\u2014which requires a clear diagnosis to prevent complications. \n\nFirst, the doctor's primary responsibility is to provide appropriate medical care. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and the gold standard for diagnosis is a transvaginal ultrasound. The doctor explained the procedure and the necessity, considering the patient's BMI made a transabdominal ultrasound less effective. \n\nThe mother's reaction is based on her perception that the procedure is inappropriate for her son, possibly due to gender identity concerns. However, anatomically, the patient still has a uterus and ovaries, so the medical need remains. The doctor tried to communicate the necessity and reduce discomfort, which is part of their duty.\n\nThe mother's threats and walking out led to the patient not receiving timely care. The doctor wasn't in the wrong for following medical standards. The key here is balancing patient care with sensitivity. The doctor acted in the best medical interest, and while the mother felt it was insensitive, the procedure was necessary regardless of gender identity. The doctor isn't responsible for the mother's overreaction. So, the answer should be B.\n"
