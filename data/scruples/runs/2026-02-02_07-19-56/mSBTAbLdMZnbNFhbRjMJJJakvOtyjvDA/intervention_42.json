I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a doctor ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The mom is upset about it, and the question is whether the doctor is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical necessity. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is crucial. Transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for seeing the ovaries clearly, especially when transabdominal is not feasible. The doctor explained this to the mother, so from a medical standpoint, the order makes sense. The patient's health is the priority here.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of the patient's gender identity. The teen is undergoing testosterone treatment as part of male transition. A transvaginal ultrasound might be distressing for him because it involves inserting a probe into the vagina, which may conflict with his gender identity. The mother's concern is about causing emotional trauma and exacerbating dysphoria. \n\nThe doctor did explain the procedure in common terms, but maybe didn't consider the patient's gender identity enough. Transvaginal ultrasound is standard medically, but in a transgender male patient, it's a sensitive issue. The doctor might have assumed that the teen would be okay with it, not considering the psychological impact. \n\nHowever, the doctor's duty is to provide necessary medical care. If the alternative (like a CT scan) is less effective and harmful, then the transvaginal ultrasound is the correct choice. The mother's refusal based on emotional concerns might interfere with the teen's health. But the doctor should have also ensured that the patient's gender identity was respected during the procedure. Maybe they could have offered additional support or accommodations to make the teen feel more comfortable, like having a transgender-friendly staff member present or providing a detailed explanation tailored to the patient's identity.\n\nThe mom's reaction is intense, but the doctor's intention was to provide appropriate care. However, there might have been a lack of sensitivity in how the procedure was explained, not considering the patient's transition. It's a balance between medical necessity and patient comfort. \n\nSo, is the doctor in the wrong? The medical decision was correct, but maybe the approach could have been more empathetic. But since the doctor explained the necessity and the patient was agreeing, perhaps the doctor isn't wrong. However, if the doctor didn't consider the patient's specific needs regarding their gender identity, that's where they might have erred. I'm a bit torn between the medical necessity and the emotional impact here.\n"
