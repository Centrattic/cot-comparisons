I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the ER doctor (the author) is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation is that the kid is on testosterone but still has a uterus and ovaries, and the mother is upset about the procedure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical necessity here. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is crucial. The transvaginal ultrasound is the standard method for this because it provides clearer images than a CT scan, which the mom suggested but the doctor correctly pointed out has more radiation and is less effective. So, from a medical standpoint, the doctor is doing the right thing to ensure the patient's safety.\n\nNow, the trans teen's situation. Since he's in the early stages of testosterone treatment, his body hasn't undergone all the changes that would occur with longer-term therapy. The presence of a uterus and ovaries means the risk of ovarian torsion is real, and the doctor needs to rule it out. The transvaginal ultrasound is the best way to do that, regardless of the patient's gender identity. However, the mother is upset because it's a procedure that might be seen as conflicting with her child's gender identity. \n\nThe doctor tried to explain the procedure in common terms and assured the patient and mother that they would minimize discomfort. The mother felt it was insensitive and accused them of causing emotional distress. The doctor didn't mention the patient's gender identity, so maybe there was a lack of communication about how the procedure relates to it. Trans patients can have complex needs, and even if the procedure is medically necessary, the approach might need to be more sensitive. \n\nBut the doctor's primary duty is to the patient's health. If the procedure is the standard and safest option, then they have to prioritize that. The mother is threatening to leave and possibly cause issues, but the doctor can't compromise on medical standards for fear of someone's reaction. \n\nHowever, the mother's perspective is important too. She might be concerned about her child's well-being and how the procedure affects their mental state. The doctor could have considered whether the patient himself was comfortable with the procedure, even if it's standard. Maybe the doctor didn't take into account the patient's gender identity in how they explained the procedure, leading to the mother's reaction.\n\nBut the key point is that the doctor followed protocol for a serious condition. The mother's upset is a reaction to a necessary procedure. The doctor can't be in the wrong for doing the right medical thing, even if it causes some discomfort. The mother's threat to leave might be a misunderstanding, but the doctor can't let that dictate the standard of care. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The procedure is necessary, and the doctor didn't act inappropriately. The mother's reaction is a result of her own concerns, not the doctor's insensitivity beyond what was necessary.\n"
