I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the ER doctor was in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager who still has a uterus and ovaries. The situation involves medical necessity versus the mother's concerns about insensitivity.\n\nFirst, the doctor's perspective: Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency. Transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing it because it provides clearer images than other methods, especially when a transabdominal ultrasound isn't feasible due to BMI. The doctor explained the procedure, the necessity, and the risks of alternatives like CT scans. The doctor's main goal is to provide accurate diagnosis and necessary care.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is upset because the procedure might cause emotional distress for her son. Transgender individuals might experience dysphoria related to procedures involving their natal anatomy. The mother's reaction suggests she believes the procedure is not in her son's best interest emotionally, even if medically necessary.\n\nNow, considering medical ethics and the doctor's duty to provide appropriate care. The doctor isn't making a choice based on the patient's gender identity but on the clinical need. However, respecting patient autonomy and comfort is also important. The doctor did explain the procedure, but maybe there wasn't enough consideration of the patient's feelings and the mother's concerns. The doctor could have offered alternatives, like a male nurse or a more gender-affirming approach, but in an ER setting, time is critical.\n\nThe key points here are the urgency of the situation and the standard of care. While the doctor followed medical protocols, the emotional impact on the patient and family wasn't adequately addressed. Maybe the doctor should have found a way to perform the exam with more sensitivity, perhaps involving a gender-concordant provider if possible, but that might not be feasible in an emergency. The mother's reaction indicates a breakdown in communication. The doctor might not be in the wrong medically but could be lacking in empathy and sensitivity to the family's situation.\n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. However, the doctor's primary responsibility is to the patient's health, and using the gold standard test is justifiable. The mother's concerns are valid regarding the patient's emotional well-being, but the doctor isn't obligated to compromise medical standards unless there's a viable alternative. Therefore, the doctor isn't in the wrong medically, but could have handled the situation more compassionately.\n"
