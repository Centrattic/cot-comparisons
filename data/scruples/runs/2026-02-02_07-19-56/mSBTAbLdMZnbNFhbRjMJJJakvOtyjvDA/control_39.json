I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the ER doctor is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The doctor ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager who is on testosterone treatment. The mother was upset about it, claiming it's inappropriate and could cause emotional distress. The doctor tried to explain that it's the best method for diagnosing ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency, but the mother was threatening to leave and even get violent. Now the question is whether the doctor made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I should recall what ovarian torsion is. It's when the ovary twists around the tissues that support it, cutting off its blood supply. It's an emergency because if not treated quickly, it can lead to tissue death. So, the doctor's concern is valid because an accurate diagnosis is crucial. Transvaginal ultrasound is the standard for this because it provides a clearer image of the ovaries compared to other methods like CT scans, which involve more radiation and are less effective for this specific condition. The doctor mentioned that the teen's BMI made a transabdominal ultrasound less effective, which makes sense because higher BMI can sometimes make it harder to get clear abdominal images.\n\nNow, the ethical part. The patient is a teenager. If the mother is the legal guardian, the doctor might need her consent. But if the teen is old enough and can make their own medical decisions, maybe that's different. Also, considering the patient's gender identity. The teen is male and might feel uncomfortable with a transvaginal ultrasound. The mother's reaction could stem from her not wanting her son to go through a procedure that's typically associated with female anatomy. But the doctor has a duty to provide necessary medical care regardless of the patient's gender identity. \n\nWait, the mother is the one who's upset. The question is whether the doctor was insensitive. The doctor explained the procedure in common terms and tried to minimize discomfort. But maybe the approach could have been more sensitive to the family's feelings. However, the medical need is urgent. The doctor can't compromise on the standard of care due to the mother's objections. If the mother is withholding consent for an emergency, the doctor might need to proceed without it under certain legal doctrines like implied consent in emergencies. \n\nBut in this case, the mother didn't agree and took the child away. The doctor's job is to recommend the best care. If the procedure is necessary and the mother is refusing without a valid reason, the doctor isn't at fault. The mother might be overreacting, but the doctor followed the standard protocol. The key is whether the transvaginal ultrasound was the appropriate test regardless of the patient's gender identity. Since the patient still has the reproductive organs in question, the procedure is medically justified. The doctor's explanation about the necessity and safety is correct, so the mother's claim of insensitivity might not hold. \n\nHowever, maybe the doctor could have considered an alternative method if possible. But the doctor states that the transabdominal was not feasible due to BMI, and CT is not suitable. So there's no better option. The doctor isn't being insensitive by following medical guidelines. The mother's reaction is understandable but possibly misguided. The doctor isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
