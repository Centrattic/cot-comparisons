I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is an ER doctor who ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager who's on testosterone but still has a uterus and ovaries. The mom was upset about it, saying it's inappropriate and could cause emotional turmoil. The doctor explained it's the gold standard for checking ovarian torsion, but the mom left with the kid.\n\nSo, the question is whether the doctor is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The patient is a trans male, but anatomically female, so the need for a pelvic ultrasound makes sense. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is crucial. The transvaginal ultrasound is the best method here. The doctor explained the procedure and the necessity, the kid was scared but understood. The mom, however, was upset, maybe because of the gender transition aspect. She felt it was causing dysphoria. The doctor tried to explain why other options like CT aren't better, but the mom was still angry.\n\nNow, considering the medical necessity. As a doctor, their duty is to provide the best care. If the transvaginal ultrasound is the standard for this condition, then not doing it could risk the patient's health. The doctor didn't force the procedure, but it's part of the treatment. The mom's resistance is based on emotional concerns, but the doctor's job is to prioritize health. However, maybe there was a communication issue. The doctor explained in common terms, but maybe the mom felt her child's feelings weren't considered. Transgender patients' experiences can be sensitive. The doctor might have needed to ensure the procedure was explained in a way that respects the patient's identity. But the doctor tried to explain, and the mom was still hostile. The doctor isn't in the wrong here because they followed medical standards. The mom's reaction is about her own feelings, not the medical appropriateness. The doctor isn't responsible for the mom's emotional response. So answer B, the doctor isn't in the wrong.\n"
