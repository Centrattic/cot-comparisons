I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the doctor here is in the wrong. So, the situation is that a trans boy comes into the ER with possible ovarian torsion. The doctor orders a transvaginal ultrasound, which is the standard procedure for this kind of diagnosis. The mother gets upset and leaves, threatening to take her son with her. The doctor is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and accurate diagnosis is crucial. The transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard because it's more effective in visualizing the ovaries, especially when a transabdominal approach isn't feasible due to the patient's BMI. The doctor explained the procedure and its necessity, which is important for informed consent. So medically, the doctor's actions seem appropriate.\n\nNext, the ethical and emotional aspects. The patient is a transgender teenager, so there's a need to be sensitive to his gender identity. A transvaginal ultrasound might be distressing for someone who is transitioning, as it involves examining anatomy that doesn't align with their gender identity. The doctor tried to explain the necessity and reduce discomfort, but the mother felt it was inappropriate. However, the doctor's primary duty is to the patient's health. If there's a medical emergency, the doctor has to proceed with the necessary tests, even if it causes some distress.\n\nThe mother's reaction is intense, but the doctor isn't the one causing the distress; the situation itself might be the cause. The doctor had no choice but to order the test for proper diagnosis. The mother's threat to leave and her anger might be due to her own discomfort or misunderstanding. The doctor can't control the mother's reaction, but they have to prioritize the patient's medical needs.\n\nAlso, the patient himself was scared but understood the procedure. The doctor explained it in common terms, which shows they tried to be clear and respectful. The mother's claims about the test causing sexual dysphoria might not be accurate, as the procedure is necessary for health reasons. However, the doctor might have considered alternative approaches if possible, but in this case, the transvaginal ultrasound is the standard method when other options aren't feasible.\n\nIn conclusion, the doctor followed medical guidelines, explained the procedure, and acted in the patient's best interest. The mother's anger is a response to the medical necessity rather than the doctor's insensitivity. Therefore, the doctor isn't in the wrong.\n"
