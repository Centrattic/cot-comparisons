I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the ER doctor is at fault for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation involves a medical emergency\u2014ovarian torsion\u2014which is a surgical emergency if not treated quickly.\n\nFirst, the doctor's main concern is the patient's health. Ovarian torsion can be life-threatening, and the best diagnostic method here is a transvaginal ultrasound. The doctor explained the procedure to the patient and the mother, and the patient understood but was scared. The mother, however, was upset and refused the test, leading to the family leaving the ER.\n\nThe doctor followed standard medical practice by choosing the most accurate diagnostic tool available. The mother's objection is based on the child's gender identity, but anatomically, the patient still has female reproductive organs. The doctor didn't act inconsiderately; they tried to explain the necessity and reduce discomfort. The mother's reaction seems extreme, even threatening. \n\nBut here's the thing: in medical ethics, there's a balance between respect for patient autonomy and the need to provide necessary care. The patient is a minor, so the parents have the authority, but the child is also capable of understanding. However, the mother's refusal could lead to harm if the torsion isn't treated. The doctor might not have the right to proceed against the parent's wishes unless there's an emergency situation where the child is in immediate danger. \n\nWait, but the situation is already a potential emergency. Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive issue. If the mother is refusing treatment based on gender identity concerns, which are not valid medically, the doctor might need to escalate the situation. However, in the scenario described, the doctor ordered the test but the mother refused. The doctor might not have the right to override the parent unless the child is a ward of the state or there's a legal reason to do so. \n\nSo, the doctor followed protocol but the mother's refusal complicates things. The doctor isn't at fault for recommending the standard test, especially since they tried to explain it. The mother's reaction is the problem here. So the answer would be B, the doctor is not in the wrong.\n"
