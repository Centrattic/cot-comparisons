I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (an ER doctor) is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation is tricky because it involves medical necessity versus the patient's and parent's feelings about the procedure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. The doctor explains that a transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. Using a CT scan instead would expose the patient to more radiation without the same diagnostic clarity. So from a medical standpoint, the doctor did what's necessary to accurately assess a potentially life-threatening condition.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The patient is transgender and identifies as male. A transvaginal ultrasound might be traumatic for them due to their gender identity. The doctor tried to explain the procedure and its necessity, but the mother felt it was inappropriate. The doctor didn't mention consulting a mental health professional or involving a gender specialist, which might have helped in explaining the procedure to the patient in a more sensitive way. However, the primary duty of an ER doctor is to address immediate health threats, and they have a responsibility to provide the best possible care based on the patient's anatomical reality, regardless of gender identity.\n\nThe parent's reaction is understandable but extreme. Threatening to leave and implying violence is not acceptable, but the doctor's priority is the patient's health. The doctor didn't force the procedure, just explained the need. The patient's anatomical status (having a uterus and ovaries) makes the ultrasound necessary regardless of their gender identity. The doctor didn't seem intentionally insensitive; they were doing their job to prevent a possible emergency.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the doctor could have been more empathetic, perhaps by involving a counselor or a specialist in transgender care, but given the urgency of the situation, that might not have been feasible in an ER setting. The key point is that the medical decision was based on necessity, not discrimination. So the doctor isn't in the wrong for ordering the appropriate test.\n"
