I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the ER doctor who ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager was in the wrong. The mom was upset, and the situation got heated. The user thinks the doctor is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the medical necessity. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency. Transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing this because it provides a clearer image than abdominal ultrasound, especially in someone with a higher BMI. The doctor explained the procedure and why it's necessary, which is part of informed consent. \n\nNow, the patient is a transgender male, which means he might have gender dysphoria. A transvaginal ultrasound could be distressing for him. The doctor tried to explain the procedure in common terms and offered to reduce discomfort. But the mother felt it was inappropriate and insensitive. The doctor's intention was medical, but the mother's perspective is about her child's emotional well-being.\n\nThe doctor didn't consider the patient's gender identity when suggesting the test. Maybe there's an alternative? The user mentioned a CT scan, but the doctor correctly pointed out the high radiation and lower accuracy. Are there other options? Maybe a transrectal ultrasound if the anatomy is suitable, but that's not standard for ovarian torsion. So the doctor had good medical reasons.\n\nHowever, the doctor didn't check if the patient was comfortable with the procedure considering their gender identity. The patient was a minor, so the mother's objection is valid, but the patient's own feelings should also be considered. The doctor might have failed to involve the patient's social support network, like the parents, but the mother's reaction was extreme.\n\nWait, the patient is a teenager undergoing testosterone treatment. The mother might be the legal guardian, so the doctor has to balance medical necessity with the family's concerns. The doctor didn't offer a compromise or a second opinion. Maybe the doctor should have considered the patient's comfort more carefully, even if the test is standard. There's a gap between medical protocol and the patient's personal experience. \n\nSo, is the doctor in the wrong? On one hand, the medical decision was appropriate. On the other hand, not addressing the patient's gender identity and the mother's concerns could be seen as insensitivity. The doctor's approach might have been too clinical without enough empathy. But the alternatives aren't viable. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the doctor failed to consider the patient's gender identity. If the doctor didn't know the patient's gender identity, maybe they should have. If they knew, then the test is still necessary but should be handled with more care. The doctor's explanation was factual but perhaps not empathetic enough. So maybe the doctor is partially at fault for not addressing the emotional impact, even though the procedure was medically correct. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the doctor is in the wrong. However, I need to weigh medical necessity against the patient's comfort. The doctor's responsibility is to treat the medical condition, but they also have an obligation to provide care that respects the patient's identity. If the doctor didn't consider the patient's feelings, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, in an ER setting, the doctor might not have time for a long discussion. The mother's reaction was extreme, but the doctor's job is to act in the patient's medical best interest. The doctor did explain the procedure and the alternatives. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but the doctor might not be in the wrong because the procedure was necessary and they tried to explain it, even if the communication could have been better. The mother's reaction is more about her own views, but the doctor's duty is to the patient's health. So the answer is B, the doctor is not in the wrong.\n"
