I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the ER doctor is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a transgender male teenager who's undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. The doctor ordered a transvaginal ultrasound because the kid presented with symptoms suggesting ovarian torsion. The mom got upset and left, threatening to cause trouble.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical context. Ovarian torsion is a serious condition that can lead to loss of the ovary if not treated quickly. The gold standard for diagnosing this is usually a transvaginal ultrasound because it gives a clearer image than a transabdominal one, especially in someone with a higher BMI where the abdominal approach might not be as effective. The doctor explained the procedure, the need for it, and the alternatives (like CT scans, which have more radiation and are less effective). The mom was upset because she felt it's inappropriate for her son, thinking it's causing dysphoria.\n\nTransgender individuals, especially those who are male but still have female anatomy, might experience discomfort with procedures that involve their body parts they don't identify with. The mom might be worried about her son's emotional well-being. But from a medical standpoint, the doctor had to order the best test for an emergency situation. \n\nThe doctor tried to explain the necessity and reduce discomfort. The mom reacted strongly, but was the doctor wrong? The doctor's duty is to provide the best care possible. The procedure is standard and necessary for diagnosis. The mom's concerns about insensitivity are valid, but the doctor wasn't being intentionally harmful. The key is whether there's an alternative that's both medically sound and considers the patient's gender identity. \n\nWait, could there be another approach? If a transvaginal ultrasound is the only effective method, then the doctor has to proceed, but maybe involve the patient more in the decision-making. The patient was a teenager, so they might have the capacity to consent. Did the doctor check with the patient directly? The scenario says the kid looked scared but understood. The mom was the one who opposed it. In some cases, minors can make decisions about their own medical care, but that depends on jurisdiction. \n\nSo the doctor followed protocol, explained the procedure, and the mom refused. The doctor isn't responsible for the mom's reaction. The priority is the patient's health. The doctor isn't in the wrong because they acted in the patient's best interest. The mom's emotional response doesn't negate the medical necessity. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
