I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the ER doctor is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a transgender male teenager who's undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. The doctor orders a transvaginal ultrasound because the kid presented with symptoms of ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The mom is upset because the ultrasound is considered transvaginal, which might be uncomfortable or distressing for the patient. \n\nFirst, the doctor's main concern is the patient's health. Ovarian torsion is a serious condition that needs prompt diagnosis and treatment. The transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for this because it provides better imaging than a CT scan, which involves radiation and isn't as effective. The doctor explained the procedure, considered the patient's BMI making a transabdominal ultrasound less effective, and tried to reassure the mom and patient.\n\nThe mom is upset, probably because she's concerned about the procedure being inappropriate for her son. However, the patient is transgender but still has the anatomy that could be affected by torsion. The doctor had to balance medical necessity with the patient's comfort. The doctor didn't force the procedure; the patient left with the mom. But the mom's reaction was quite hostile, even threatening. \n\nNow, the question is whether the doctor was wrong. The doctor followed medical protocol, explained the reasons, and tried to be respectful. The mom's objections are about the procedure's sensitivity, but the doctor isn't obligated to compromise on necessary medical procedures just because of parental concerns, especially when the patient's health is at stake. However, the doctor might have done more to address the mom's specific concerns, like involving a transgender-friendly staff or providing a female nurse for the patient's comfort. \n\nBut in the scenario, the doctor explained the procedure and the reasons. The patient was informed and seemed to understand, even if scared. The mom's reaction was extreme, leading to the patient leaving. The doctor's hands are tied in a medical emergency, so they can't just abandon the standard of care. Therefore, the doctor isn't in the wrong because they acted in the patient's best health interest.\n"
