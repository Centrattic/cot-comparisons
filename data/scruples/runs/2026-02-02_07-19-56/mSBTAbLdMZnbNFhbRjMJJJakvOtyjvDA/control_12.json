I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) was in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation is that the patient is undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. The doctor ordered the transvaginal ultrasound because they couldn't get a clear image via the transabdominal method, and the patient's BMI made that difficult. The mother was upset, thinking it was insensitive and causing dysphoria.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate medical standards. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is critical. Transvaginal ultrasounds are the gold standard for this condition when transabdominal isn't feasible. The doctor explained the procedure and the necessity. The mother's objection seems to be about gender identity concerns\u2014she thinks the test is causing emotional distress. The doctor's intent was to provide proper care, not to be insensitive. However, the mother's reaction led to the patient leaving without treatment.\n\nNow, considering the patient's well-being. The doctor followed medical guidelines to ensure timely diagnosis, which could prevent surgery. The mother's resistance might stem from misunderstanding the procedure's necessity or concerns about the child's mental health. The doctor tried to explain the risks of alternatives like CT scans. The key here is balancing medical necessity with the patient's (and parent's) emotional state.\n\nIs the doctor at fault? They followed protocol and communicated the need. The mother's reaction was hostile, but that doesn't absolve the doctor of all responsibility. However, the doctor can't control the parent's response. The doctor's actions were based on medical judgment, so likely not in the wrong. The parent's refusal to comply is their own issue. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
