I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) was in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation involves a medical emergency\u2014ovarian torsion\u2014which is a surgical emergency. The doctor explains that a transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing this condition, especially when a transabdominal ultrasound isn't feasible due to the patient's BMI.\n\nThe mother is upset, thinking the procedure is inappropriate and could cause emotional distress for her son. The doctor tried to explain the necessity and that they'd minimize discomfort. The mom then threatens to leave and possibly take her son elsewhere, even threatening the staff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical standards. Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive issue. If not diagnosed quickly, it can lead to loss of the ovary. The transvaginal ultrasound is more accurate in such cases, especially when transabdominal isn't effective. So from a medical standpoint, the doctor's action seems justified.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The patient is a teenager undergoing testosterone treatment but still has female anatomy. The doctor needs to balance medical necessity with sensitivity. The doctor did explain the procedure in common terms, which shows effort to communicate clearly. However, the mother's concerns about insensitivity and causing dysphoria are valid from a psychological perspective. Transgender individuals can experience dysphoria related to procedures involving their body parts that don't align with their gender identity.\n\nThe doctor might have overlooked the patient's gender identity in the urgency of the situation. Maybe they could have considered alternative explanations or discussed the procedure in a way that acknowledges the patient's identity, perhaps using gender-neutral terms or ensuring the patient feels respected. However, the doctor's primary duty is to address the medical emergency, and they did communicate the necessity of the test.\n\nThe mother's reaction is intense, but it's also possible she's overreacting due to fear for her child's emotional well-being. The doctor might not have been wrong in their medical decision, but perhaps could have handled the communication differently to address the mother's concerns more effectively, maybe involving a social worker or a transgender-sensitive care specialist.\n\nIn conclusion, while the doctor acted in line with medical standards, there might be room for improvement in addressing the emotional and psychological aspects. However, given the urgency of ovarian torsion, the doctor isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
