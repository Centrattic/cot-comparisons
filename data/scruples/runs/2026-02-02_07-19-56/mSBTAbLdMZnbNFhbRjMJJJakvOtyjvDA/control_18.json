I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) was in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The patient is a teenager undergoing testosterone treatment as part of transitioning to male, but still has a uterus and ovaries. The presenting issue is possible ovarian torsion, which is an emergency. The doctor wanted a transvaginal ultrasound for a better view since a transabdominal one wasn't feasible due to the patient's BMI. The mother got upset, calling the procedure inappropriate and insensitive, accused the doctor of causing dysphoria, and left with the kid.\n\nSo, the key points here are medical necessity vs. the mother's concerns. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and accurate diagnosis is crucial. Transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for this because it provides clearer images, especially when transabdominal isn't possible. The doctor explained why a CT wasn't suitable (radiation and lower accuracy). \n\nThe mother's objections might stem from discomfort with the procedure given the child's gender identity. But the doctor's role is to provide the best possible care based on medical standards. The doctor explained the procedure, considered the patient's comfort, and followed protocol. The mother's reaction seems to be based on emotional distress rather than medical grounds. \n\nThe author didn't force the procedure; they offered the standard treatment and the patient and parent chose to leave. The doctor isn't in the wrong here because they acted in the best interest of the patient's health. The mother's disagreement doesn't make the medical decision incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
