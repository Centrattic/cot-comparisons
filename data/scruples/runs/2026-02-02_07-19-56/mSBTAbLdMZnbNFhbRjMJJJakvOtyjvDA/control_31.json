I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the ER doctor is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a transgender male teenager who's undergoing testosterone treatment but still has a uterus and ovaries. He comes in with possible ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor wants to do a transvaginal ultrasound, which is the standard for this condition. The mother objects, saying it's inappropriate and causing dysphoria, and they leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical necessity. Ovarian torsion is an emergency, and accurate diagnosis is crucial. Transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard because it's more effective than CT, which has radiation risks. The doctor explained the reasons clearly, so from a medical standpoint, the decision seems correct.\n\nThen there's the transgender aspect. The patient is a trans boy, so a transvaginal exam might be distressing. But the doctor did explain the procedure and tried to minimize discomfort. The mother's concern is about emotional trauma and dysphoria, which are valid. However, the doctor's job is to provide necessary medical care. \n\nIs there an alternative? The doctor mentioned that a transabdominal ultrasound isn't feasible due to the patient's BMI. So there's no better option. The mother's reaction was hostile, and the doctor didn't force the procedure. The patient was scared but understood. Maybe the doctor could have offered more reassurance or involved a gender-affirming approach, but the primary goal was to address a medical emergency. \n\nThe answer might hinge on balancing medical necessity with sensitivity. Since the doctor followed protocol and explained the procedure, and the mother refused despite the risks, the doctor isn't necessarily at fault. The mother chose to leave, so the responsibility isn't on the doctor. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
