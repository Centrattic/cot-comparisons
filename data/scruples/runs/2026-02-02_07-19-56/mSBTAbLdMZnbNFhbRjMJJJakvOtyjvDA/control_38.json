I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the ER doctor is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager who's on testosterone but still has a uterus and ovaries. The mom got really upset and left, threatening to cause trouble if they mentioned the test again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical reasoning. The doctor says that transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for checking ovarian torsion, which is an emergency. A transabdominal ultrasound might not be as effective, especially with the patient's BMI. So, medically, they were trying to do the right thing to assess a serious condition quickly and accurately.\n\nNow, the parent's reaction was based on the belief that the procedure is inappropriate for her \"son.\" But since the patient is a transgender male, they still have female anatomy, so the test is necessary. There's a conflict between medical necessity and the parent's perception of their child's identity.\n\nThe doctor explained the procedure and why alternatives like CT scans aren't suitable. They also mentioned reducing discomfort, which shows they considered the patient's feelings. The mom's anger was about perceived insensitivity, thinking it would cause emotional distress and sexual dysphoria. However, the doctor's duty is to diagnose and treat medical emergencies, which overrides these concerns in an emergency situation.\n\nBut maybe the doctor could have handled the communication better. Explaining the procedure in more detail, maybe involving a counselor or social worker to address the family's concerns, could have helped. However, in an ER setting, time is critical, and the doctor had to act swiftly. The mom's threat to leave and take the patient with her complicates things, but the doctor's priority is to provide necessary care.\n\nSo, balancing the medical necessity with the parent's concerns, the doctor isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason for the test and tried to explain it. The parent's reaction is based on misunderstanding the medical need. The answer should be B (No).\n"
