I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the ER doctor is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender teenager. The situation involves a medical emergency, ovarian torsion, which is serious.\n\nFirst, the doctor's role is to provide necessary medical care. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and the gold standard for diagnosis is a transvaginal ultrasound when a transabdominal one isn't feasible, especially with a higher BMI. The doctor explained the procedure clearly to the patient and the mother, but the mother was upset. \n\nHowever, the mother didn't accept the explanation and left with the patient, possibly delaying treatment. The question is whether the doctor made the right call. \n\nThe patient is a transgender male but still has a uterus and ovaries. The transvaginal ultrasound is anatomically appropriate here because the reproductive organs are still present. The doctor had to make a decision based on medical necessity. \n\nBut maybe the mother felt that the procedure was intrusive or conflicting with her child's gender identity. The doctor might not have considered alternative methods of communication or accommodations that respect the patient's identity while still getting the necessary imaging. For example, possibly using a different approach if available, or ensuring that the patient's gender identity was fully respected during the procedure, like having a provider of the same gender or using appropriate language.\n\nHowever, in medical emergencies, the priority is often to act quickly to prevent harm. If the doctor followed standard protocol and explained the reasons, maybe they were justified. But if there was a way to respect the patient's identity more fully, perhaps the doctor could have done more. \n\nThe mother's reaction might be due to misunderstanding or emotional distress. But the doctor's duty is to the patient. If the mother was denying care, the doctor might have needed to involve Child Protective Services or find another way to ensure the patient received necessary treatment, but that's a different scenario. \n\nIn this case, the doctor followed medical standards, but maybe missed an opportunity to address the mother's concerns more compassionately, considering the patient's gender identity. The key points are medical necessity vs. patient and family sensitivity. \n\nSo, is the doctor in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether the procedure was necessary and if the doctor acted appropriately in explaining and respecting the patient's identity. If the doctor did everything correctly, then B (not in the wrong). If they could have done more to accommodate the patient's identity, maybe A. But given the situation's urgency and the mother's resistance, maybe the doctor wasn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
