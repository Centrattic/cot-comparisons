I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the ER doctor is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. Let's start by understanding the situation. The patient is a teenager on the early stages of testosterone treatment, so they're male assigned at birth but undergoing transition. Anatomically, they still have a uterus and ovaries, which makes sense because testosterone doesn't remove those organs.\n\nThe initial problem is ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor wanted to do a transvaginal ultrasound, which is the standard method to check for this. The mother got upset and left, threatening to take her son with her. The doctor is questioning if they were insensitive.\n\nFirst, I should consider the medical necessity. Ovarian torsion is serious and needs accurate diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard here. The doctor explained that a CT scan isn't ideal because of radiation and lower diagnostic accuracy. So medically, the approach seems appropriate.\n\nThen, the issue is whether the procedure is appropriate for a transgender male. Since the patient has not had surgery to remove the\u5b50\u5bab and\u5375\u5de2 (like a hysterectomy or oophorectomy), those organs are still present. So, from a medical standpoint, the need for a transvaginal ultrasound remains regardless of the patient's gender identity. The doctor explained the procedure in common terms and tried to minimize discomfort, which shows they were trying to be considerate.\n\nHowever, the mother felt it was insensitive. The doctor might not have considered the emotional impact on the patient. Trans people often face challenges with medical procedures that involve their natal anatomy, which can cause dysphoria. The doctor's approach might have been too clinical without enough sensitivity to the patient's gender identity. Even if the procedure is necessary, the way it was communicated or the lack of alternatives considered could be an issue. The doctor didn't mention any other possible methods, like perhaps a transrectal ultrasound, though I'm not sure if that's feasible for this specific condition. But there might be other ways to handle the procedure with more sensitivity, such as using a different protocol or providing additional support.\n\nThe key points are: the doctor acted in good faith for medical reasons, but the mother's reaction suggests there was a lack of understanding or communication regarding the patient's gender identity. The doctor might have assumed that the patient's gender transition would make the transvaginal ultrasound unnecessary or that the patient wouldn't be comfortable with it. However, the patient was present and seemed to understand the procedure, even if he was scared. The mother's emotional response could have been due to her own discomfort or misunderstanding, but the doctor's duty is to the patient's health.\n\nIn terms of medical ethics, the principle of beneficence (doing good) and non-maleficence (avoiding harm) applies. The doctor's intent was to prevent harm by accurately diagnosing a potential emergency. However, the principle of autonomy and respect for the patient's wishes is also important. The mother's interference in the decision-making process, given that the patient is a teenager and might be able to make their own decisions depending on local laws and their maturity, could be a point. The doctor should have ensured that the patient understood the necessity and was comfortable, maybe offering more support or alternatives if possible.\n\nSo, the doctor isn't necessarily in the wrong because the procedure is medically appropriate. However, there might be room for improvement in how it was handled to be more sensitive to the patient's needs. The mother's reaction might be based on her own biases or a misunderstanding of the medical necessity. The doctor's responsibility is to provide care, even if it's challenging or uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no other angle where the doctor could have been more considerate. Maybe considering the patient's comfort, like using a different approach if available, but if it's the gold standard, then the doctor is justified.\n"
