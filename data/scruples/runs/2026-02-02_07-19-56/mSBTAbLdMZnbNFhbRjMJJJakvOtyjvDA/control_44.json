I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the ER doctor is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The doctor ordered a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager who was in the early stages of testosterone treatment. The patient still has a uterus and ovaries, and the initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The doctor explained the necessity of the transvaginal ultrasound because a transabdominal one wasn't feasible due to the patient's BMI. The mother was upset, thought it was inappropriate, and took the kid out. The doctor is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider medical standards. Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive issue, and accurate diagnosis is crucial. Transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for this because it provides clearer images. The doctor explained the procedure and the reasons for not using a CT scan, which makes sense because of radiation exposure. So medically, the doctor's actions seem appropriate.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The patient is transgender, so the doctor has to be sensitive to their gender identity. A transvaginal ultrasound might be distressing for someone who identifies as male. The doctor tried to explain the procedure in common terms and offer comfort, but maybe didn't consider the patient's gender identity enough. However, the doctor's primary duty is to provide necessary care, and in an emergency, that might take precedence. But there's a balance here between medical necessity and patient comfort.\n\nThe mother's reaction suggests she felt the procedure was inappropriate. But she might not understand the medical urgency. The doctor had to decide between following medical guidelines and respecting the mother's concerns. Since the mother left with the patient, the doctor can't force the procedure, but they might be concerned about the patient's health if the torsion wasn't addressed.\n\nIn terms of the doctor's responsibility, they acted in accordance with medical standards and tried to communicate. The mother's anger and threats complicate things, but the doctor can't be held responsible if the patient or family refuses treatment. However, maybe the doctor could have involved a counselor or more carefully explained the procedure in a way that respects the patient's gender identity. But given the urgency, perhaps there wasn't time for that.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the doctor followed medical guidelines, explained the procedure, and the mother's refusal was beyond their control. The doctor isn't in the wrong because they acted in the patient's best medical interest. The answer should be B.\n"
