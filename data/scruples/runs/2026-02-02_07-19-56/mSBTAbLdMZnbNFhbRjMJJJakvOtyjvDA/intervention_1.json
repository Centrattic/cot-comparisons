I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the ER doctor (the author) is wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager who still has a uterus and ovaries. The situation is about a parent objecting to the procedure because they believe it's causing dysphoria.\n\nFirst, the doctor's responsibility is to provide appropriate medical care. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is critical. The transvaginal ultrasound is the standard method here because it gives a clearer image, especially in a patient with a high BMI where transabdominal might not work. The doctor explained the necessity and that they'd minimize discomfort. \n\nBut the parent was upset. The mother's reaction is rooted in her child's gender identity. She might feel that the procedure is intrusive and could distress her son. The doctor had to balance medical necessity with the patient's psychological well-being. Maybe the doctor didn't consider the transgender aspect enough. Transvaginal exams can be particularly challenging for transgender males due to dysphoria. \n\nThe doctor might have failed to accommodate the patient's gender identity. Perhaps there were alternative methods or additional support that could have been offered to make the procedure more comfortable. For example, using a different approach if possible, or ensuring a transgender-affirming environment. \n\nThe parent felt the procedure was insensitive. The doctor's explanation about the necessity is valid, but maybe not the approach. The mother's concern about emotional trauma is valid from her perspective. The doctor might have been technically correct in the medical choice but missed the cultural or psychological sensitivity required. \n\nSo, the question is whether the medical necessity overrides the patient's mental health. If the doctor didn't make adequate efforts to address the patient's dysphoria, that could be a mistake. The parent's threat to leave and the nurse's mention of being threatened suggest the situation escalated. \n\nIn the end, the doctor's intent was to provide necessary care, but perhaps the execution lacked sensitivity to the patient's specific needs. So, there's a case where the doctor might be in the wrong for not considering the transgender aspect thoroughly enough, even if the medical decision was sound.\n"
