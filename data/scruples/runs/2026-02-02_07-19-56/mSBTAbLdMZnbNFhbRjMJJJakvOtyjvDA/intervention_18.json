I had a shift where I had a teenage kid come in, he was apparently in the early stages of testosterone treatment in order to reassign male. However, anatomically he continued to have a uterus and ovaries.\n\n His initial presentation was concerning for ovarian torsion, and his BMI was not really going to allow us to do a transabdominal (through the skin and abdominal wall of the pelvic region) ultrasound which would allow us to see the signs we are looking for to ensure the ovary is not compromised (ovarian torsion is technically a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is kinda super important).\n\nWe explained that we needed to do a transvaginal (just like it sounds, it's an ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is seated in the vagina against the cervix to visualize the uterus and ovaries clearly) ultrasound. This is really the safest way to assess the ovary and see if emergency surgery is necessary. I explained the procedure in common terms and how it would be performed. Kid looked scared but understood. Mom looked upset. \n\nI step out and see some more patients. Next thing I know, a nurse comes to my desk and says the mom of the kid with the OT is flipping out and upset. I'm confused, so I get back in the room and ask what's going on. \n\nMom is fuming, saying the ultrasound we're ordering is inappropriate and insensitive to her son. I explain to her that we're only ordering what is gold-standard for this diagnostic entity, and that we will do whatever possible to reduce discomfort. She asks why we can't do a CT, and I explain that not only is that quite a lot of radiation, the CT is not well designed to see this issue, so we would be causing more harm than good. \n\nShe ultimately says we are being insensitive and completely ignorant, that our choice of diagnostic testing is going to cause emotional turmoil for her child, that we're using medical testing as an excuse to cause her child sexual dysphoria, and she states that she is leaving with her son before she does something she'll regret. She states that one more word about this and she's going to let us have it. \n\nShe stomps out of the room with her teenager in tow and leaves. \n\nKid? No idea if he needed surgery. Our nurses were confused and were sorta directly threatened by the mother.\n\nSo, AITA? I don't feel like I was being insensitive, but I have no clue. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the ER doctor is in the wrong for ordering a transvaginal ultrasound for a transgender male teenager. The situation is that the kid is on testosterone but still has a uterus and ovaries, so the doctor thinks it's necessary for checking ovarian torsion. The mother got upset and left, threatening to cause trouble.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical standards. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, so accurate diagnosis is crucial. Transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard for visualizing the ovaries in this case. Since the patient has a vagina (as he's on early testosterone treatment and still has those organs), the doctor is doing what's needed for a proper assessment.\n\nBut then, the mother's reaction. She might be upset because her son is transgender, and a transvaginal ultrasound could be seen as reaffirming his assigned gender at birth, which might cause emotional distress. The doctor explained the necessity, but maybe the approach wasn't sensitive enough. However, the doctor is following protocol and prioritizing the patient's health. They also mentioned reducing discomfort, which shows some consideration.\n\nThe key points are: medical necessity vs. emotional impact. The doctor's primary duty is to the patient's health. The mother left, which could mean the kid didn't get the needed care, but the doctor did their job. However, in a pediatric ER, the doctor might need to consider the parents' consent, especially if the patient is a minor. But the mother was being combative, not the kid. The doctor might have had to proceed without consent, but in this case, the mother took the kid away.\n\nAlso, the doctor didn't mention if the patient gave consent. In some cases, minors can consent to certain procedures, but it's usually with a guardian. So the doctor might have had the right to order the test, but the mother's feelings are valid because it's a sensitive issue. The doctor might be in the right medically but need to improve communication with the parents. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to be both medically sound and sensitive. But since the doctor was explaining the procedure and the reasons, maybe they are not in the wrong. The answer is likely B, the doctor is not in the wrong, as they acted in the best interest of the patient's health.\n"
