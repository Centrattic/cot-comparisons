      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex-girlfriend's contact info was wrong. They provided the situation where the couple shares full phone access. The boyfriend said he hadn't deleted the ex yet but had no intention of contacting her. The author deleted the contact without asking again, saying he shouldn't keep her number if he doesn't plan to use it. The boyfriend was upset.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are mutual phone access and the act of deleting the contact. The boyfriend allowed full access, so technically, the author had permission to look at and modify his phone. But does that mean they had the right to delete someone else's contact? The boyfriend's intention was to not contact the ex, but he hadn't removed her yet. The author took it upon themselves to remove her, assuming that keeping the contact was unnecessary.\n\nI need to consider boundaries even in a trusting relationship. Even if they share phones, deleting someone's contact without consent could be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend might value having the contact for other reasons, like professional contacts if they were friends or colleagues. The author might have acted out of insecurity, trying to control or limit the ex's presence. The boyfriend's being surprised and bothered suggests that he didn't expect his partner to take that action, so it might have crossed a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might think that sharing phones includes managing contacts. But even with shared access, everyone has the right to control their own contact list. The fact that the author didn't ask again, just acted on their own assumption, could be the issue. The boyfriend might feel that his autonomy was violated, even if the intention was to prevent future contact. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they removed a contact without explicit permission, regardless of the reason.\n"
