The guy said he wasn't going to contact his ex again, so the author deleted her.\n\nFirst, respect boundaries. Even if they share access, the boyfriend might consider his contacts personal. He might have a reason not to delete her, like needing her for something else, even if he doesn't plan to contact her. The author assumed they could delete it because he hadn't removed her yet. But maybe he had a different reason for keeping her, like family matters or needing her info for another reason. Deleting without asking might be overstepping. The boyfriend being surprised and bothered shows he didn't expect that. So the author might be in the wrong because they took action without considering his possible reasons beyond just contacting her. Also, even if they have access, it's about mutual respect. The right answer is A.\n"
