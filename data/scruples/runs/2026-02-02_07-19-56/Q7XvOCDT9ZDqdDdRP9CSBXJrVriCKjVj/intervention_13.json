      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex's contact info was wrong. They mentioned that both the couple allows full phone access. The boyfriend hadn't deleted the ex himself, so the author took it upon themselves. The question is whether that's acceptable.\n\nFirst, even if they have full phone access, deleting someone else's contact without permission might cross a boundary. The boyfriend had said he didn't plan to contact her, but he might still have a reason to keep her in his contacts for other reasons, like professional references or past connections. The author made a decision based on their own judgment without considering his possible perspective.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend was surprised and seems bothered, which indicates he might not have wanted that action. Respecting each other's autonomy, even within a trusting relationship, is important. The act of deleting the contact could be seen as an overstep because it's removing someone from his personal data without his consent, even if the intention was good. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
