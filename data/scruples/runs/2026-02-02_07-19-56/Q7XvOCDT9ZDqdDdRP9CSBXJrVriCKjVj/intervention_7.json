      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex's contact number was in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple allows full phone access. The BF has his ex in his contacts, says he hasn't deleted her but isn't contacting her. The author deletes the contact. The BF is surprised and upset. The author justifies it by saying if he's not going to contact her, why keep her there. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual agreement. They said they allow full phone access, which might imply trust and sharing. However, deleting someone's contact without asking might be seen as overstepping, even if it's mutual access. The BF might value the right to keep contacts, even if he isn't using them. \n\nThe author's reasoning is valid\u2014why keep unused contacts? But the BF might feel that his personal choices about his phone (like keeping contacts) are his to manage. The action of deleting it could be seen as a breach of trust or respect, even if the BF isn't using the contact. The BF's reaction of being surprised and bothered suggests that he didn't expect the author to act on his stated intention without asking.\n\nSo, even though the couple has an open phone policy, there's an implicit understanding that each person can manage their own contacts unless they agree otherwise. The author took initiative without discussing it, which could be seen as violating that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the BF's autonomy in that specific decision, even if the BF hadn't deleted the contact yet.\n"
