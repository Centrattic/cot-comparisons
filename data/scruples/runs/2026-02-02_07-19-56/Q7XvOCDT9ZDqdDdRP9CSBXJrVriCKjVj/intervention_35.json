      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex's contact info is in the wrong. They provided a scenario where the boyfriend allowed full phone access, and the girlfriend deleted the ex's number after he said he wasn't going to contact her again.\n\nHmm, the key points here are consent and boundaries. Even though they have access to each other's phones, does that mean they can edit or remove things without asking? The boyfriend might have his reasons for keeping the contact, maybe for emergencies or other non-romantic reasons, even if he's not planning to contact her. The girlfriend made a decision based on her own judgment without considering his possible reasons. \n\nThe boyfriend was surprised and asked why she did it, which shows he didn't expect her to take that action. Even if he's not in touch with his ex, the contact might still be there for other purposes. The girlfriend's action could be seen as overstepping because she's altering something personal on his phone without his explicit permission. \n\nSo, even though the intention was good, the action might have been a breach of trust or boundaries. The boyfriend might feel that his autonomy over his phone's contacts is being respected less. So, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong.\n"
