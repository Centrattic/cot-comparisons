      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex's contact number was wrong. They both have full phone access. The boyfriend said he wasn't going to contact her again, so the girl deleted her. Now he's upset.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about privacy and boundaries. Even though they have access to each other's phones, does that mean they can delete contacts? The boyfriend didn't delete the contact himself, but he hadn't gotten around to it. The girl took initiative, thinking it was okay since he said he wouldn't contact her. But maybe the boyfriend felt that his data, even if it's on her phone, is his to manage. So she might have overstepped by deleting it without asking. Even if they share phones, deleting someone's contact without consent could be seen as a boundary issue. The boyfriend being surprised and bothered shows he didn't expect that action. So maybe the author is in the wrong because she didn't respect his choice to keep the contact even if he's not using it. Even if the intention was good, the action might have been too much. So answer A.\n"
