      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex's contact number is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple allows full phone access. The boyfriend had his ex in his contacts, said he wouldn't contact her, so the author deleted her. Now the BF is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have an open agreement about phone access, so maybe the author thought it was okay. But deleting someone's contact without permission, even if it's part of the agreement, might be a boundary issue. The BF might have wanted to keep the contact for other reasons, even if he doesn't plan to contact her. Maybe he wanted to keep it for memories, or in case something came up. The author acted on their own assumption, which might not have respected the BF's autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that since they have full access, they can manage contacts. But usually, even with shared access, deleting someone else's contact without discussion could be seen as overstepping. The BF's surprise and being bothered suggests he didn't expect this action. So, maybe the author should have discussed it first instead of deleting it. \n\nSo the question is, does the access agreement allow for deleting contacts? If the agreement is just about viewing, not modifying, then the author is wrong. Even if it's full access, it's about respecting each other's decisions. The author assumed the BF wouldn't use the contact, but maybe the BF had the right to decide. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting his choice to keep the contact.\n"
