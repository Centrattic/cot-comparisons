      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex's contact number is in the wrong. The situation says they have full phone access with each other. The boyfriend hadn't removed his ex yet, and the author deleted her.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. First, they said they allow full access to each other's phones. That might mean they have an open agreement to look at each other's stuff. The boyfriend had said he wasn't going to contact her again, but hadn't deleted her yet. The author deleted her without asking, even though he was surprised.\n\nThe main question is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, if they have full access, maybe it's allowed. But deleting someone's contact is a personal decision. Even if the boyfriend said he wouldn't contact her, it's his choice to keep her in his contacts. The author might have thought they were helping, but taking action without consent could be an issue. The boyfriend being bothered suggests he felt it was an invasion of privacy. So maybe the author did wrong by deleting without asking. So answer A.\n"
