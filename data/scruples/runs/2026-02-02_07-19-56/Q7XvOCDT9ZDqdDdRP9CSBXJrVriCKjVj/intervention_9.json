      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves the author deleting their boyfriend's ex-girlfriend's contact number from his phone. They both have full access to each other's phones. The boyfriend hadn't removed the ex yet but said he had no intention of contacting her. The author deleted her contact, and now the boyfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries of a relationship. Full phone access might imply a high level of trust and openness, but does that include editing each other's contacts? The boyfriend didn't explicitly say it was okay to delete the contact, so the author might have overstepped by making that decision without discussion.\n\nRespecting privacy is important even in open relationships. Even if they have access to each other's phones, personal choices like maintaining contacts might be a private matter. The boyfriend might have had reasons for keeping the contact, even if he didn't plan to use it. Maybe it was a memento, or perhaps he wanted to keep it for some future need. By deleting it, the author might have disregarded his autonomy.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author could have discussed the issue and asked if deleting the contact was okay instead of doing it without permission. The fact that the boyfriend was surprised suggests he didn't expect his partner to take such an action. This could lead to a breach of trust if he feels his boundaries were crossed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to remove someone the boyfriend had no intention of contacting. They might have felt it was unnecessary to keep the contact. However, the right to manage one's own contacts should lie with the individual. Even if the access allows viewing, it doesn't necessarily extend to modifying without consent.\n\nSo, considering the lack of communication and the potential disregard for the boyfriend's autonomy, the author is likely in the wrong. The action, while well-intentioned, crossed a boundary by not respecting the boyfriend's personal choice to keep the contact.\n"
