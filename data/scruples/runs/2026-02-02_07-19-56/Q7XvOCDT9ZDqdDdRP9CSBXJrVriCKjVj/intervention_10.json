      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex's contact info is in the wrong. The situation is that they both have full phone access. He said he wasn't going to contact her again, so she deleted her number. He was surprised and seems bothered now.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. They agreed to full phone access. So, technically, she had the right to look through his phone. He mentioned he hadn't removed her contact yet but had no intention of contacting her. Then she took it upon herself to delete it without asking again. \n\nWait, even though he said he wasn't going to contact her, he might still have a personal reason to keep the contact. Maybe for closure, or maybe he just didn't get around to it. But she assumed it was okay to delete it because he said he wasn't going to contact her. \n\nBut did she overstep? They have mutual access, so maybe she thought it was okay. But deleting someone's contact without consent, even if they said they wouldn't contact them, could be seen as violating trust. Because even if he didn't use it, the contact was his to manage. \n\nAlso, maybe he didn't mind her being there but didn't want to delete her for personal reasons. By deleting it, she made a decision for him. Even if her intention was good, taking action without discussing it further could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nIf they both agreed to full access, maybe it's a matter of personal boundaries within that agreement. He might have felt that his control over his own contacts was undermined. So even though he didn't want to contact her, the fact that she removed it without asking could be an issue. \n\nSo the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author did something that violated mutual trust or boundaries, then A. If it's not, then B. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is important. Even if he said he wouldn't contact her, the contact was his to remove. She assumed it was okay, but maybe she should have discussed it more or let him handle it himself. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because she took control of his phone's contact list without his explicit permission, even if he had said he wouldn't contact the ex.\n"
