      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex's contact number is in the wrong. The situation is that they have an open agreement allowing full phone access. The boyfriend hadn't removed his ex yet, saying he had no intention of contacting her. The author deleted the contact, and now the boyfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. They allow each other full access to their phones, so the author might feel justified in making that decision. But the key point is consent and boundaries. Even with access, does deleting someone else's contact without asking cross a line?\n\nThe boyfriend expressed that he hadn't removed the contact yet but didn't plan to contact her. The author took it upon themselves to delete it, assuming he wouldn't use it. However, the boyfriend being surprised and bothered suggests that he didn't expect her to do that. Maybe he valued the contact for other reasons, like not wanting to delete it himself for sentimental reasons, even if he wasn't going to call her.\n\nRespecting personal boundaries is important. Even if the boyfriend didn't plan to use the contact, it's his phone and his decision. The author's action might have disregarded his autonomy. While the intention was good, the action could be seen as overstepping because they didn't ask first. The boyfriend might feel that his personal space was invaded, even if the content was about someone he's not in contact with anymore.\n\nSo, even though the couple shares phone access, the act of deleting a contact without discussion could be considered a breach of trust or boundary. The author might have acted out of concern, but the right approach would be to discuss it with him rather than take action. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect his autonomy in that decision.\n"
