      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who deleted the ex's contact is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the boyfriend and his current partner have an open policy where they can access each other's phones. The partner saw the ex in his contacts and asked why she was still there. He said he didn't plan to contact her again but hadn't gotten around to deleting her. The partner then deleted the contact, and he was surprised and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple allows full phone access, so the partner didn't violate a boundary by looking. The bf said he wasn't going to contact her, but maybe the partner felt that keeping the contact was a red flag or made the bf uncomfortable. However, deleting someone's contact without permission might be a step too far. Even if they share phones, there's a limit to how much one should interfere with the other's personal data. The bf might have had a reason to keep the contact, like for closure, or maybe he changed his mind later. Also, the partner might have overstepped by acting on their own without discussing it first. On the other hand, if the bf was genuinely not using the contact and the partner felt it was a trigger, maybe there's some understanding. But generally, deleting someone's contact without consent could be seen as invasive. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they acted without considering the bf's autonomy, even if the intention was good.\n"
