      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who deleted their boyfriend's ex's contact number is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the couple allows full phone access. The boyfriend hadn't deleted his ex's contact yet but said he didn't plan to contact her. The author deleted it, and now the boyfriend is upset.\n\nHmm, first, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The couple allows full phone access, so technically, the author had access. But does that mean they have the right to delete someone else's contact? The boyfriend's intention was to not contact her but hadn't acted on it. The author took action without discussing it further. \n\nI think the main issue is about respecting boundaries. Even if they share phones, personal choices like keeping contacts might be a personal decision. The author made a choice for the boyfriend without asking, which could be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend was surprised and upset, so it shows that the action affected him. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning was that if he didn't want to contact her, the contact shouldn't be there. But maybe it's up to him to decide whether to delete it. The author might have assumed they were being helpful, but without considering his feelings about keeping the contact. \n\nAlso, communication is key. They could have discussed it more before taking action. The author might have thought they were helping, but it's possible that the boyfriend had sentimental reasons for keeping the contact, even if he didn't plan to use it. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably overstepped by deleting the contact without fully understanding the boyfriend's perspective. Even though they had access, the action was taken without mutual agreement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
