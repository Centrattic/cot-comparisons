      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who deleted their partner's ex's contact info) is in the wrong. The situation involves mutual phone access and differing opinions on handling exes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple allows each other full phone access, which implies a level of trust and shared control over their devices. The author deleted the ex's contact because the boyfriend said he wasn't going to contact her again. The argument is whether the author overstepped by deleting the contact without permission, even if the boyfriend had no plans to use it.\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were acting in the best interest of the relationship, removing a potential trigger or reminder of the ex. They might feel that if the boyfriend isn't going to use the contact, keeping it is unnecessary. This could be seen as a gesture of trust or proactive in maintaining boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, deleting someone's contact without asking could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if the boyfriend intended to delete it later, the act of someone else doing it might make him feel that his autonomy is disregarded. Phone contacts are personal, and altering them without discussion could lead to feelings of disrespect or mistrust.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being surprised and bothered suggests that he didn't expect his partner to take that action. The author's justification is logical, but actions in relationships often depend on mutual respect for boundaries. Even with shared access, it's possible that each person has different comfort levels regarding who is in their contacts and how they handle past relationships.\n\nSo, while the intention might have been good, the action could be seen as crossing a line because it's about personal space and autonomy. The boyfriend might feel that the author didn't consult him or consider his feelings about maintaining that contact, regardless of his plans to delete it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his partner's personal choice in this matter.\n"
