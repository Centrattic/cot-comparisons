      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent yelling at another child for making fun of their autistic son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has mild autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. The cousin's daughter, 13 years old, took the son's toys and hid them, making him upset. Later, the girl told others the son was a \"retard\" and then said it directly to the parent. The parent snapped and yelled, leading to the girl crying and her mom being upset. The parent left the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if the parent was in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI should think about the intent and the actions. The parent was defending their child from hurtful language. Using a derogatory term like \"retard\" is offensive, especially when directed at someone with autism. However, the parent's response was yelling, which might be seen as aggressive. But given the context of protecting their child from bullying, maybe it's understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent could have handled it differently, like addressing the issue calmly or talking to the girl's parents. Yelling might not be the best approach, but it's a reaction to a hurtful comment. The parent also left the situation, which could be a way to avoid further conflict. \n\nLegally and ethically, defending against bullying is important. However, public yelling might be inappropriate. But considering the emotional impact on the son and the parent's frustration, maybe it's a justified reaction. \n\nI need to balance between the harmful action of the girl and the parent's response. The parent was defending their child's dignity. The girl's actions were bullying, so the parent's reaction, while not perfect, might be understandable. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? They used strong language in public, which could be seen as inappropriate, but the intent was to stop the bullying. The answer might depend on cultural or situational factors. In some views, protecting one's child is right, even if the method isn't ideal. In others, yelling could be seen as overreacting.\n\nI think the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong because they were defending their child from bullying, even if the method wasn't perfect. The derogatory term used by the girl is more harmful, and the parent's action was a reaction to protect their son's well-being.\n"
