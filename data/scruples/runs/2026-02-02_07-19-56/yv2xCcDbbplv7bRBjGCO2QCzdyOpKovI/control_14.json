A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The situation is that the author's son has autism, and another kid was messing with him by hiding his toys and then called him a \"retard.\" The author snapped and yelled, then left the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child with autism is likely more sensitive, and the other child's actions could be hurtful. The term \"retard\" is offensive and derogatory, even if used by a child. The author's reaction was to yell in the moment, which might be seen as a natural response to protect their child. However, yelling, even in anger, can escalate the situation and might not be the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the other child's mother is upset about the language, which could indicate that the mother is sensitive to that word, even if the child was just repeating something. The author left the situation, which might be a good move to de-escalate but also could be seen as avoiding the conflict.\n\nLegally and socially, using the term \"retard\" is considered offensive and inappropriate. Even if the child was the one who said it, the author's yelling in response might not be the best solution. The right approach would be to address the behavior calmly and educate the other child about respectful language. However, in the heat of the moment, emotions run high, and the author's intention was to protect their child. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. If we look at the action of yelling and using the term \"retard,\" even if it's a reaction to the insult, it's still using a derogatory term. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for responding with that language, even if it's in defense. Alternatively, the immediate context of defending one's child might mitigate the wrongdoing. \n\nConsidering that the mother's reaction was to yell, which caused the other child to cry and her mother to be upset, the author could have chosen a different method to address the issue. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to be careful here because the situation is complex. However, according to the guidelines, the answer should be A or B. Since the author used the term in anger, which they acknowledge was wrong, the answer is likely A.\n"
