A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. So, the situation is that the author's son has mild autism and was being teased by a cousin's daughter. The daughter took his toys and hid them, then said a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child with autism might be more sensitive, and the teasing could be hurtful. The other kid used a term that's offensive, even if it's a child. The author's reaction was to defend their child, which is a natural instinct as a parent. But yelling in front of others and causing the other child to cry might be seen as over the top.\n\nHowever, the other child's actions were also problematic. Using a slur, even as a teenager, is unacceptable. The author's anger is understandable, but maybe the response could have been different. The mother of the other kid is upset about the language used, which is a valid point because the term is offensive. The author's choice to walk out might be seen as a way to de-escalate, but maybe there could have been a better approach, like addressing the issue calmly after the fact.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are defending their child from bullying and the use of a slur. On one hand, the author protected their son from hurtful treatment. On the other hand, yelling in public might not have been the best method. However, considering the emotional stress of the situation, especially during a family gathering, it's a tough call. The other child's actions were clearly inappropriate, so the author's reaction was in response to that. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they were defending their child from bullying. But maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. The other mom got upset about the language, but the slur was the initial problem. The author's use of the same term in anger might have been unwise, but it's in the context of defending their child. So overall, the author is more in the right because they were protecting their son from a bully using hurtful language. Answer B.\n"
