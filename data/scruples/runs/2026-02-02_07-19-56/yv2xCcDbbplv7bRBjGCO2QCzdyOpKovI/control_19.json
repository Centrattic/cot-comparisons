      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author yelling at another child for insulting their autistic son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The cousin's daughter is 13 and was messing with the author's 7-year-old son, who has mild autism. The girl hid the toys and then called the boy a \"retard,\" leading the author to snap and yell. The mother of the other child got upset about the language used. The author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the other child intentionally targeted the son, using a derogatory term. The author's reaction was to yell, which caused the other child to cry and her mom to be upset. The author feels conflicted but acknowledges they might be in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author was defending their child from bullying. The term \"retard\" is offensive and hurtful, especially towards someone with a disability. The author's son is vulnerable, and the other child is a teenager, which might mean she should understand the inappropriateness of her actions. However, the author's response was to yell in front of the family, leading to emotional reactions from both the girl and her mom.\n\nIs it wrong to protect one's child? Probably not. But the method used might be questionable. Yelling in public, especially in front of family, could be seen as overreacting. However, given the context of defending against a derogatory slur, some might argue it's justified. The mother of the other child is upset because of the language used, but the author was responding to her daughter's use of the same language. There's a conflict here between defending one's child and maintaining composure.\n\nThe author left the situation, which could be seen as a positive action to de-escalate. But the initial reaction of yelling might have been inappropriate. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since the other child's actions were harmful, the author's intent was protective. However, using the same offensive term, even in anger, might not be the best approach. The mother's reaction is about the language used, which is a valid concern, but the root issue was her daughter's behavior.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author was protecting their child from bullying and a derogatory term, which is understandable. However, their response involved using offensive language themselves, which could be seen as wrong. The emotional response is valid, but the method could have been better handled. So, depending on the perspective, the answer might vary. But in terms of right and wrong, the author might be in the right in defending their child, but the yelling could be considered in the wrong in terms of the approach. However, the line between defense and escalation is thin here.\n"
