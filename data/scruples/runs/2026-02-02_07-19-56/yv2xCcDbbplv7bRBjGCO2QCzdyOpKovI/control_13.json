A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after yelling at someone else\u2019s kid during Christmas. The situation involves their son with mild autism being upset because a 13-year-old cousin's daughter hid his toys and then called him a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, which caused the girl to cry and her mom to get angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which might make social interactions more challenging. The other kid's actions\u2014hiding toys and using a hurtful word\u2014could have been particularly stressful. The author's reaction was emotional, which is understandable given the situation. But is yelling the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, protecting one's child from bullying or hurtful language is important. The term used by the other child is offensive and harmful, so the author's anger is justified. However, yelling in public, especially at another person's child, might not be the best method. It could lead to embarrassment for the other child and escalate family tensions, as seen when the author left. \n\nThe key points are: the other child's behavior was inappropriate, the author acted in defense of their child, but the method (yelling) might have been reactive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. While the intent was to stand up for their son, the action could be seen as overreacting, even if the provocation was bad. The author acknowledges it wasn't the right thing to do, so their own reflection is part of the analysis.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The offensive term is a significant issue, and the author's reaction was a direct response. However, the approach taken might not be the most constructive. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes), the author is in the wrong, but with some nuance. The main wrong here is the yelling, not the intent. The other child's actions were wrong, but the parent's response, while understandable, wasn't appropriate. The author could have addressed it calmly without yelling, which might have de-escalated the situation better. So the answer is A.\n"
