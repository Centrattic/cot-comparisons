A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author yelled at their cousin's daughter for bullying their autistic son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism and struggles to fit in. The cousin's daughter was hiding his toys and then called him a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, which led to the girl crying and her mom being upset.\n\nI should start by thinking about the justification for the author's actions. They were defending their child from bullying, which is a natural instinct. The term used was \"retard,\" which is a hurtful slur, so the parent's reaction to protect their son is understandable. However, yelling in front of everyone might not be the most constructive way to handle it, but the intent was to protect their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's daughter's actions were inappropriate, but the parent's response could have been handled differently. Yelling might escalate tensions and not teach the girl a better lesson. Also, the mom's reaction to the author's language is valid because using that word could have been hurtful to the girl, even if the intent was to defend their son. The author walked out, which might show they took it seriously but could have caused more family conflict.\n\nI need to weigh the intent against the method. The parent's intent was protective, but the method was confrontational. In such situations, it's important to address the behavior without using aggressive language. The author might have been wrong in yelling but not entirely wrong since they were reacting to their child being bullied. It's a nuanced situation where both sides have points, but the parent's action, while understandable, could have been handled better.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because even though the situation is understandable, yelling and using the slur (even in anger) isn't the right approach. However, some might argue B because the parent was protecting their child. But the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the parent used a derogatory term and escalated the situation, even if provoked, that could be seen as wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
