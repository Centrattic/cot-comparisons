A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at a cousin's daughter during Christmas when the daughter was teasing their autistic son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was taking the son's toys and hiding them, which upset the son. Then she called him a \"retard,\" which is a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, leading to the girl crying and her mom being upset. The author left, feeling conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points: the daughter's actions were hurtful and targeted a vulnerable child. The author's reaction was a defense of their child. But yelling in front of family might have escalated things. The mother of the girl is upset about the language, but the term used was itself offensive.\n\nIs yelling justified? Well, defending one's child is natural, especially against bullying. However, the method of response could be questioned. Yelling might not be the best approach, but given the emotional state, it's understandable. The author's son has autism, which adds to the sensitivity. The term \"retard\" is a slur, so calling someone out for using that term isn't wrong. The mother's anger might stem from the language used, but the original insult was worse.\n\nThe author left, which might not have been the best solution for resolving the conflict, but their intent was to protect their child. So, while the yelling wasn't ideal, the situation is complex. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were a proportional response to the provocation. The girl's behavior was clearly wrong, so standing up for one's child isn't necessarily in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
