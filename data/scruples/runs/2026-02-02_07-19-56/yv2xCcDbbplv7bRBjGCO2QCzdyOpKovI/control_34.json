      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the context: the author's son has mild autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. The cousin's 13-year-old daughter is messing with the son by hiding his toys and later calling him a \"retard.\" The author then yells at the girl, leading to her crying and her mom being upset. The author walked out, feeling justified but questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The cousin's daughter is being intentionally mean and using a derogatory term towards the author's son. The term \"retard\" is offensive and hurtful, especially when directed at someone vulnerable, like a child with autism. The author's reaction is an emotional outburst in defense of their child.\n\nNow, considering the options. A says the author is in the wrong. B says not. The question is whether the author overreacted or if the situation justified their actions.\n\nThe girl did something harmful. Calling someone a \"retard\" is a slur and is hurtful. The author's son is particularly vulnerable, so defending him is understandable. However, the author used strong language (\"YOU CAN'T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\") in front of the family, which upset the other child and her mother. The mother then criticized the author for using that language, which the author might argue is justified given the context.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the initial action\u2014yelling\u2014might be seen as a justified defense of their child from bullying. However, using the same derogatory term in anger could be problematic. The author could have addressed the situation calmly, perhaps by confronting the girl's mother or taking steps to protect their son without yelling. However, the situation is emotionally charged, and the author's response could be seen as a natural reaction to defend their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did escalate the situation. The other child's mother was upset about the language used, and the author walked out. The cousin's daughter's actions were harmful, but the author's response might have been more aggressive than necessary. The question is whether the author's response was proportionate.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the cousin's daughter was clearly in the wrong for bullying. The author's defense of their son is understandable, but the method of response might be seen as inappropriate because it involved yelling and using the slur in return. However, the intent was to protect their child from harm.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions are measured. Some might argue that defending their child is right, but the manner (yelling, using the slur) is not. Others might see it as a justified stand against bullying. Given the options, the user is asking for a choice between A and B. Considering that the author's actions, while understandable in intent, may have escalated the conflict and could have been handled better, the answer might lean towards A. But if the focus is on defending their child from bullying, then B. However, using the same offensive language is problematic. So the answer is likely A, but there's nuance here.\n"
