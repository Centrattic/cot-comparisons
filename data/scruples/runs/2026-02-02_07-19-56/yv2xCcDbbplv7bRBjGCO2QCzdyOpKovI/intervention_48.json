A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at another person's child during a family gathering.\n\nFirst, the author's son has mild autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. The cousin's daughter took the toys and called the son a \"retard,\" which led the author to yell. The key points here are the trigger and the reaction.\n\nThe other child's actions were clearly inappropriate\u2014hiding toys and using a derogatory term. The term \"retard\" is offensive and hurtful, especially when said to a child with autism. The author's reaction was to yell, which caused the other child to cry and the mother to be upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, defending their child from bullying and harmful language is understandable. Parents often feel strongly about protecting their children, especially when there are underlying issues like autism. The term used is a slur, and the situation escalated quickly in a family setting.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling, even if in anger, might not be the most constructive response. However, given the circumstances\u2014another child using a derogatory term and the author's emotional state\u2014it's a reaction born out of parental instinct. The author left the situation, which might have been a way to de-escalate further.\n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because of the yelling. However, considering the offensive language used by the other child, the author's response could be seen as defending their child. The mother of the other child got upset over the language, but the original slur might have been worse.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions might be justified as protecting their child from bullying and offensive language. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
