      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for yelling at another kid for calling their autistic son a slur. The situation is that their cousin's daughter was messing with their son by hiding his toys, then called him a \"retard.\" The author snapped and yelled, then left the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which might make him more sensitive or have different social interactions. The other girl's actions were targeted and hurtful, both by hiding toys and using a derogatory term. The term \"retard\" is a slur and offensive, especially towards someone with disabilities.\n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which is a strong response. However, given that their child was being targeted with a derogatory term, their emotional response is understandable. The question is whether their reaction was justified. Yelling might not be the best approach, especially around children, but the intent was to protect their son from being mocked. The family's reaction was to blame the author for using that language, but the original slur was from the other child. The author's use of the term in their outburst could be seen as reactive rather than proactive. \n\nLegal and ethical considerations: The author was defending their child from being bullied. However, using the same slur, even in anger, might be seen as inappropriate. The key point is that the other child initiated the offensive language, so the author's use of it was in response to a direct insult. The family's disapproval might be misplaced if they're holding the author accountable for responding to a slur with a similar term.\n\nSocial norms: While yelling isn't ideal, the context of defending a child from a slur might mitigate the blame. The author's actions were impulsive but driven by a desire to protect their child. The girl's mother's reaction might be more about the use of the slur than the underlying issue of her daughter's behavior.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions were a reaction to their child being bullied with a slur. While yelling isn't the best approach, the context of defending a vulnerable child from targeted abuse could mean they aren't entirely at fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they were protecting their child, even if their response was impulsive.\n"
