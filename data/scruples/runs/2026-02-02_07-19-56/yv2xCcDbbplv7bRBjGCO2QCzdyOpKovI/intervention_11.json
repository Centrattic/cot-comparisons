      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the scenario carefully.\n\nThe person is a parent with a 7-year-old son who has mild autism. Their cousin's 13-year-old daughter is messing with their son by taking his toys and hiding them, making him upset. Later, the girl tells the sister's kids that the son is a \"retard\" and then nudges the parent, saying the same thing. The parent yells at the girl, causing her to cry, and her mom gets upset about the language. The parent leaves the situation, feeling they might be in the wrong.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. They need an answer A or B based on whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's son has autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter is 13, so she's a teenager. She's intentionally causing distress to the younger child, using a derogatory term. The parent reacts emotionally, yelling in front of family, leading to the girl crying and the mom being upset.\n\nIs yelling the right action? Well, the parent is defending their child from bullying. The term \"retard\" is offensive and hurtful. The parent's reaction is in response to direct insults towards their son. However, the parent used the same offensive language when yelling. That's problematic because it's using the very term they're upset about. Even if the intent is to stop the bullying, using that language could be seen as condoning it, even if it's in anger.\n\nBut the parent's main issue is defending their child. The girl's actions were clearly mean and targeted. The parent might feel that a strong reaction was necessary to protect their son's dignity, especially in front of siblings. However, the method of reaction\u2014yelling and using the offensive term\u2014might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation and set a poor example, even if the parent's intention was good.\n\nAlso, the parent left the situation, which might be a way to avoid further conflict but could be seen as abandoning the problem rather than addressing it constructively. The mother of the girl was upset about the language, which the parent used. So there's a conflict between protecting one's child and respecting others' feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parent's actions were a reaction to a direct insult towards their child, which is understandable. But using the same derogatory term, even in anger, is problematic. The parent might have wanted to stop the bullying but could have done so in a calmer, more constructive way, maybe by talking to the girl's parent or removing the girl from the situation without escalating it with yelling.\n\nSo while the parent's intentions were protective, the method used might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the parent is partially at fault for using the offensive language. However, the girl's actions were clearly wrong. The overall situation is complex, but the parent's choice to yell and use the term is likely the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
