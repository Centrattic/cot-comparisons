A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their cousin's daughter during a family gathering. The situation involves the author's son with autism being teased by the girl, who took his toys and called him a \"retard.\" The author then yelled at the girl, causing her to cry and her mom to get angry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The girl was repeatedly provoking the author's son, which could be traumatic, especially with autism. The use of a derogatory term is a significant factor here. The author's reaction was an emotional response to defending their child, which is a natural instinct. However, yelling in public might not be the best approach, but the underlying issue is the harassment of their child.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The girl's actions were deliberate and hurtful. 2) The term \"retard\" is offensive and harmful. 3) The author's intent was to protect their son. 4) The public confrontation led to further conflict.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and perspectives, defending a child from bullying is generally seen as right. However, the method of response can be questioned. Yelling might escalate the situation. But given the emotional state of the parent, it's understandable. The mother's main wrong might be in the reaction style, not the intent. The girl's mother being upset about the language is also a point\u2014maybe the term is less commonly used now, but the intent behind the slur matters more.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the girl's actions were the root problem. The author's response was in defense of their child. While yelling isn't ideal, the context of protecting a vulnerable child from bullying could mitigate blame. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the core issue was the girl's behavior, and the parent was defending their child.\n"
