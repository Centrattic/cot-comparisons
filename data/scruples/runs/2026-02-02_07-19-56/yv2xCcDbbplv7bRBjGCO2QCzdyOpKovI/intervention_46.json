A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at another kid is in the wrong. The situation involves a 13-year-old girl messing with a 7-year-old boy with autism by taking his toys and later calling him a slur. The parent then yells at the girl, leading to some fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's son has autism, which might make him more sensitive or have different social interactions. The cousin's daughter is 13, an age where they might test boundaries or be more aware of differences. However, using a derogatory term like \"retard\" is a serious issue.\n\nThe parent's reaction was yelling, which is a strong response. But the intent was to protect their child from a harmful slur. On one hand, yelling could be seen as overreacting, especially in front of family. On the other hand, the parent might feel that standing up for their child is necessary, given the emotional impact.\n\nBut the problem lies in the method. Yelling in front of others might have escalated the situation. The parent could have addressed the issue privately or taught the cousin's daughter why that language is hurtful. Also, the mother of the other child was upset because the parent used that language, but the slur itself was the initial problem. The parent wasn't saying the slur; they were reacting to it.\n\nHowever, the parent could have handled it more calmly. Walking out might have been a reaction to the stress, but leaving the scene could be seen as avoiding the conflict rather than resolving it. The key points are the use of the slur by the 13-year-old and the parent's response. The parent's intent was protective, but the method may not have been the best. So, while the parent's feelings are justified, their actions might have been inconsiderate of the broader family dynamics. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
