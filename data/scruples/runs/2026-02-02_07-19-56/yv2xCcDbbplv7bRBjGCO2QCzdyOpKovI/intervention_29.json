A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at another's child during a family gathering. The situation involves their cousin's daughter messing with their son, who has mild autism, by hiding his toys and then calling him a derogatory term. The author snapped, yelled, and then left the party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter was taking his toys, which can be stressful for any child but especially so for someone with sensory or social processing issues. Then, using the word \"retard\" is a serious slur and deeply hurtful. The author's reaction is a defense of their child's dignity.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, defending their child is a natural parental instinct. The use of the term \"retard\" is offensive and inappropriate, so the author's anger is understandable. But yelling in front of family and causing the girl to cry might not have been the best approach. There might have been a more constructive way to handle it, like privately addressing the issue with the girl's parents first.\n\nThe author's decision to leave the party was their choice, but maybe they could have stayed to resolve the situation calmly. However, walking out might have been a way to de-escalate the conflict. The key points are the use of a slur, the stress on the autistic child, and the appropriateness of the immediate reaction. While the author's intentions were to protect their child, yelling might not have been the most effective method. So, the answer is nuanced. The author might not be entirely wrong, but there could be room for better conflict resolution. But according to the user's initial thought, they lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, considering the context, maybe the answer isn't straightforward. The user wants a choice between A and B. Given that the author used strong language and caused another child to cry, maybe A is the answer. But if the provocation was significant, B could be justified. Need to decide based on typical AITA standards. In similar cases, defending a child's dignity is often seen as justified, but the method matters. Yelling might not be appropriate. So leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe not. The slur is a big issue. So perhaps the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
