A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves them yelling at a cousin's daughter because the girl was messing with their autistic son and using a derogatory term.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has mild autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter took his toys and then called him a \"retard.\" That's a derogatory term, which is a clear issue. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to the girl crying and her mom getting upset over the language used.\n\nNow, evaluating who is in the wrong. The cousin's daughter definitely did something hurtful and inappropriate by using a slur. The author's defense of their son is understandable given the situation. However, the author used the same derogatory language in their response. Even though they were defending their son, using that term in front of others could be seen as problematic, even if the context was to confront the slur.\n\nThe family dynamics are important too. The author left the situation, which might have been necessary to de-escalate things, but their public confrontation in front of family might have caused further tension. The mother's reaction to the language is also valid because such terms are harmful regardless of context.\n\nSo, while the cousin's daughter was in the wrong for her actions, the author's use of the same language could be seen as a mistake. They might have handled it differently, like confronting the girl privately without using that term. Therefore, the author could be considered partially in the wrong for their choice of words, even if their intentions were to protect their son.\n"
