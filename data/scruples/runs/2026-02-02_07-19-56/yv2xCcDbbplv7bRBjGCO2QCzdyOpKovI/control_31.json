A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves yelling at another person's child after their son was teased and called a derogatory term.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's son has mild autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. The cousin's daughter took his toys and hid them, making him upset. Then she told others that the son was a \"retard\" and tested the author by saying it to her. The author snapped, yelled, and then left. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nSo, the author is defending their child from being bullied. The other child's actions were mean and targeted the vulnerability of the author's son. Using a slur like \"retard\" is hurtful and degrading, regardless of the child's age. The author's reaction was an emotional response to protect their child. However, yelling in front of others might be seen as losing control. But considering the context, the provocation was significant. The other mother was upset about the language, but the author was defending against a derogatory term. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, defending one's child from bullying is generally seen as justified. However, the method of response (yelling) might be questioned. But given the emotional stress and the fact that the other child was being intentionally cruel, the author's reaction is understandable. The key points are protection of a vulnerable child and the use of a hurtful slur. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they were defending their child from being bullied. The answer would be B, No.\n"
