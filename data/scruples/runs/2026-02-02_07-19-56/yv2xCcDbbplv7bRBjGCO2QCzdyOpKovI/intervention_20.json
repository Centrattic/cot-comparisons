A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at another child's kid was in the wrong. The scenario involves a 7-year-old son with mild autism. The cousin's 13-year-old daughter was taking the son's toys and hiding them, making him upset. Then the girl used a derogatory term (\"retard\") about the son and approached the parent to say it, leading to the parent yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's son has autism, which might make him more sensitive or vulnerable. The other child's actions were both teasing (taking toys) and using a hurtful term. The parent's reaction was yelling in defense of their child. The parent left the family gathering because of the tension.\n\nNow, the parent is questioning if they were wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nI should weigh the parent's intent to protect their child against the method used. Yelling in public, especially in front of family, can be seen as inappropriate, but the parent was defending their child against bullying. However, the term \"retard\" is offensive and using that language could escalate the situation. The other parent was upset about the language, which the parent used in response. \n\nBut the parent's main issue was the other child's behavior towards their son. The parent's reaction was immediate and emotional. The key factors here are the child's vulnerability and the use of a derogatory term by the other child. The parent was defending their child's dignity.\n\nOn one hand, yelling might not be the best approach in a public setting with family, but given the circumstances, the parent might feel that they had to act to protect their child's feelings and prevent further bullying. The other parent's reaction might be based on the parent's use of the offensive term, even if it was in response to the child's use of it. \n\nHowever, the parent could have addressed the issue without yelling, perhaps by confronting the other parent privately. But in the heat of the moment, people might not always act rationally. The parent's primary responsibility is to protect their son, especially when the child's needs are different and require more support.\n\nSo, considering the intent to protect a vulnerable child from bullying and the immediate emotional response, the parent might not be in the wrong. However, the method of response could be questioned. But the core issue is the other child's behavior, so the parent's defense is understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), though there's room for debate on the approach taken.\n"
