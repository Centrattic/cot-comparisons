A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after yelling at another kid for calling their autistic son a \"retard.\" The writer's son has mild autism, and the cousin's daughter was messing with him by hiding his toys and then saying that slur. The writer snapped and yelled, causing the other kid to cry and her mom to get upset.\n\nHmm, so first, the daughter's actions were definitely wrong. Using a slur like that is hurtful and inappropriate. But the writer responded by yelling in front of others, which led to the girl crying and the mom being upset. The writer left the situation, which might have been a reaction to the tension.\n\nNow, considering context: the daughter was provoking the writer's son because he's autistic. The writer's son was already upset, so there's added stress. The daughter used a derogatory term, which is a serious issue. However, the writer's response was yelling in public, which might not have been the best approach. While the intent was to protect their child, yelling could have escalated things instead of addressing the problem constructively.\n\nBut maybe the writer didn't have a moment to think and just reacted emotionally. The daughter was being disrespectful, so the parent's reaction is understandable in that light. However, using public yelling might not model good conflict resolution for their son, who has autism and might already struggle with social interactions. Also, the mom of the other child felt targeted because of the language used, which might have been a valid concern since \"retard\" is offensive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer's reaction was wrong. On one hand, defending their child against bullying is right. On the other hand, the method used was not ideal. The writer could have addressed the other child's behavior in a calmer, more private way to avoid public shaming. The girl was 13, so maybe a talk could have been better. But in the heat of the moment, it's hard to stay calm. The writer might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. However, considering the daughter's age and the fact that she was being disrespectful, the parent's reaction is somewhat justified. But the yelling in front of everyone and walking out might have been an overreaction. So, maybe the answer is A, but it's a bit of a gray area. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, so maybe they lean towards A. But maybe the author isn't entirely wrong because the other child was being cruel. Hmm.\n"
