A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about yelling at another person's kid during a family gathering. The user has a son with mild autism who's having trouble fitting in. The cousin's daughter is hiding the toys and then calling the son a \"retard.\" The author yells at the girl, causing her to cry, and then leaves in a huff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, so being bullied or teased might be more harmful for him. The other girl's actions were clearly hurtful. Using a derogatory term like \"retard\" is offensive, especially towards someone with a disability. The author's reaction was to yell, which is a strong response. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, yelling at a 13-year-old might not be the best approach. Even if the girl was in the wrong, the author's response caused the girl to cry and her mom was upset. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like talking to the parents first or addressing the issue calmly. However, the author's intent was to protect their son, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, using that kind of language in front of others could be seen as escalating the situation. The author might have overreacted, but the provocation was also significant. The mom's reaction to the language is understandable, but maybe the author had the right to defend their son's dignity. \n\nI think it's a mix of both. The author had a reason to be upset, but their method of addressing it wasn't the best. However, given the context of protecting their child, it's a bit more complex. But according to the options, I have to choose A or B. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering that they used harsh language in a public setting and caused a scene, maybe A is the answer. But also, the provocation was pretty bad. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. The author's actions were not ideal, but the situation was bad. Still, yelling and using strong language in front of others might be the wrong approach. So maybe A.\n"
