A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The scenario is that the author's cousin's daughter was messing with their son, who has mild autism, by hiding his toys and then calling him a \"retard.\" The author snapped and yelled at the kid, leading to her crying and the mother being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which makes it harder for him to socialize. The other kid's actions were hurtful and targeted. The author was defending their son, which is a natural instinct. But yelling in front of family and using strong language might have been a poor choice. However, the trigger was the use of a derogatory term, which is a serious issue.\n\nOn one hand, defending a child is important, and the insult was severe. On the other hand, the method of confrontation could have been handled differently. Maybe the author could have addressed the issue calmly first before escalating. But given the emotional state and the context of the holiday, where tensions might be higher, it's understandable that they lost their temper.\n\nThe author's intention was to protect their son, which is valid. The consequence was that their actions upset family members, but the root cause was the other child's behavior. So, while yelling isn't ideal, the situation might mitigate the wrongdoing. However, the author acknowledges they might be in the wrong, so maybe the answer leans towards A. But I'm a bit conflicted because the defense of their son is justified. Hmm.\n"
