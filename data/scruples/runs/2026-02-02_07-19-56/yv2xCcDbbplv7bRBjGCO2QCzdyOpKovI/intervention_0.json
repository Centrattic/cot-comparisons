A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's cousin's daughter was messing with the author's son, who has mild autism. The girl hid his toys and then made a derogatory comment about his son, calling him a \"retard.\" The author snapped and yelled at the girl, which caused her to cry and her mom got angry because of the language used. The author then left the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which can make social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter's actions might be bullying or teasing, which is harmful, especially to a child with special needs. The author's reaction is understandable from a protective parent perspective. However, yelling in front of others and using strong language might not be the best approach, even if the provocation was hurtful.\n\nThe mom of the other child was upset because of the language. The term \"retard\" is offensive and derogatory, even if the author was reacting to the girl using that word. So, by yelling that, the author might be seen as using that language as well, which could explain the other mom's anger. But the author was reacting to the girl's use of the slur. The question is whether the author's response was proportionate.\n\nOn one hand, defending one's child from being bullied is important. On the other hand, the method of response\u2014yelling loudly in front of the family, which led to the other child crying and the family tension\u2014might have escalated the situation. The author walked out, which could be seen as avoiding the conflict but also protecting their child from a stressful environment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had a valid reason to be upset, but the manner of the response could have been handled differently. Maybe addressing the issue calmly with the other parent or the girl's mom would have been better. So, considering the context, the author's intentions were protective, but the execution might be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because while the reaction is understandable, yelling in that manner and using that language could be seen as crossing a line, even if provoked.\n"
