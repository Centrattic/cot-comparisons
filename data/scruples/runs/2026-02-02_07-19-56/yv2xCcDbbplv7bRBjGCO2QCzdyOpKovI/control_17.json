A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation is during Christmas, the author's son has mild autism and was being targeted by the cousin's daughter. The daughter took the toys and later called the son a \"retard,\" leading the author to snap and yell.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has a condition that makes social interactions challenging. The other child's actions were both taking toys and using a derogatory term. The word \"retard\" is offensive and harmful, especially when directed at someone with a disability. \n\nThe author's reaction was to yell in front of the family. The question is whether this was wrong. On one hand, defending one's child is natural, and the term used is extremely hurtful. The mother's outburst might be seen as a protective response. However, yelling in public, especially in front of the child, could be seen as poor handling of the situation. The other mom was upset about the language, which the author used. The author left, but the key point is whether the yelling was justified.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here, but socially, it's about appropriateness. The other child's use of the slur is inexcusable. The author's reaction, while emotional, was in defense of her child. However, the method (yelling in front of family) might be seen as unprofessional or overly aggressive. But considering the provocation and the need to protect her child, some might argue it's understandable, even if not the best approach. The author herself feels it wasn't the right thing, which adds complexity. So, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call, but the offensive language from the other child might justify her reaction. However, the way she responded could be questioned. But overall, maybe not in the wrong, considering the circumstances.\n"
