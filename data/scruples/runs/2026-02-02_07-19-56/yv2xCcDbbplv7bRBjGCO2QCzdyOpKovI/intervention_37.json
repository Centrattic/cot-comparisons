A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid during a family gathering. The writer explains that their 7-year-old son has mild autism, and during Christmas, the cousin's 13-year-old girl took his toys and hid them, making him upset. Later, the girl told other kids that the son was a \"retard\" and then mocked the writer with a nudge. The writer snapped, yelled at the girl, leading to the girl crying and her mom getting angry for using that language. The writer left the event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the situation. The writer's son has autism, which might make social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter's actions\u2014hiding toys and using a derogatory term\u2014could be seen as bullying. The writer's reaction was a loud outburst in front of the family, which caused the girl to cry and the mother to be upset. The writer feels conflicted but thinks they're in the wrong.\n\nI should evaluate whether the writer's actions were justified. Yelling in front of family and using strong language might not be the best approach, but the intent was to defend their child. The term \"retard\" is offensive and hurtful, especially to someone with autism. However, the writer's response was immediate and emotional. Is it wrong to stand up for your child, even if the method was harsh?\n\nAlso, the mother's reaction to the language used by the writer might be about the word itself, which is considered a slur. The writer's use of the word in anger could be seen as escalating the situation. But the original insult was from the cousin's daughter. There's a balance between protecting one's child and maintaining composure in a family setting. The writer left the event, which might have been necessary to de-escalate the situation, but the initial outburst still has consequences.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, while defending a child is understandable, yelling in public (even in a private family gathering) and using strong language might be seen as crossing a line. However, the context of autism and the use of a derogatory term by the other child adds complexity. The writer might feel their child's dignity was at stake. Still, the method chosen could have been more constructive. Maybe a private conversation with the girl's mother would have been better. But the immediate need to protect their son and stop the bullying might justify the reaction in some eyes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. On one hand, defending against bullying is right, but the method might be unwise. On the other hand, using strong language and yelling could be seen as inappropriate. The answer hinges on whether the intent and context mitigate the action's severity. The user's own thought is that they are in the wrong, but others might see it differently. Considering social norms and the potential harm caused (the girl crying, family tension), the answer might lean towards A (wrong). However, the underlying reason for the outburst is defensible. Hmm.\n"
