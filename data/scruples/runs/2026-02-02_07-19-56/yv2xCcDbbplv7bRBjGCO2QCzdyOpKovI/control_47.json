A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation is that their son has mild autism and was being targeted by a cousin's daughter. The girl took the toys and called the son a \"retard,\" which made the author snap. They yelled, causing the girl to cry and her mom to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which might make social interactions harder. The other kid was being cruel, hiding toys and using a derogatory term. The author's reaction was emotional, which is understandable given the situation. However, yelling in front of others and causing the girl to cry could be seen as escalating the conflict.\n\nBut then, the girl's actions were hurtful and potentially bullying. The author was defending their child, which is a natural instinct. The term \"retard\" is offensive and hurtful, so the author's strong reaction might be justified as protecting their son. However, the method of addressing it (yelling) might not have been the best approach, especially in front of other family members. The author left, which could be seen as removing the situation from the stressful environment, but it also might have been a flight response rather than addressing the issue calmly.\n\nThe key points are: defending one's child against bullying, the appropriateness of the response, and family dynamics. While the author's intent was protective, the method might not have been the most constructive. However, given the emotional stakes and the offensive language used by the girl, the author's reaction could be seen as a justified emotional response rather than being in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The author could have handled it differently, but the core issue is the other child's behavior.\n"
