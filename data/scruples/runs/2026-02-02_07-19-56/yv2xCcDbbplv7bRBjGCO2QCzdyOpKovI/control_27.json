      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for yelling at another child. \n\nFirst, the context: The author's son has mild autism, and they were at a family gathering. Another 13-year-old cousin's daughter was taking and hiding the author's son's toys, making him upset. Then, the girl used a derogatory term (\"retard\") to describe the author's son. The author snapped and yelled at the girl, leading to her crying and the mother getting upset. The author left the event afterward.\n\nSo, the key points here are the girl's actions, the severity of the language used, and the author's reaction. The term \"retard\" is offensive and can be considered a slur, especially when directed at someone with a disability. The author's son is vulnerable, and the girl's actions were both cruel and targeted. \n\nThe author's response was an emotional outburst, which can be seen as disproportionate if the girl was a minor. However, the term used is highly offensive, so the author felt a strong need to defend their child. The mother's anger is about the language used, but the author argues that the girl's language was the problem. \n\nLegally and ethically, using a slur is wrong, especially towards someone with a disability. The author's reaction could be seen as defending their child against bullying. However, yelling at a 13-year-old, even if she was in the wrong, might be considered an overreaction. The mother might feel it's not appropriate for an adult to yell at a child, even if the child was being disrespectful. \n\nBut given the context of the child's autism and the derogatory language, the author's reaction is understandable. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and context. The author was defending their child from a hurtful slur, which is a strong point in their favor. \n\nHowever, the method of response (yelling) might be seen as not the best approach, even if the intent was good. The daughter's mother was upset about the language used by the author, which implies that even using the same slur in response might not be acceptable, regardless of the reason. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they were defending their child from a slur. On the other, they used the same offensive language in their yelling. The key here is whether using that language, even in response, was wrong. If the author used the exact same slur (\"retard\") in their yelling, that could be the issue. However, the original post says the author yelled, \"YOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\" So the author is using the term to express the inappropriateness of the girl's language, not necessarily using it as a slur themselves. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the author is objecting to the term, using it in their yelling might still be considered using that language, which the girl's mother took offense to. So the mother's reaction is about the language being used in the household, perhaps in front of other children. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's intent was to protect their son from a slur, which is justifiable. The method of response could be seen as an overreaction, but the core issue is the other child's behavior. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, making the answer B (No). However, if the author used the term in a way that was equally offensive, even if it was to object, that might flip the answer. But the nuance here is that the author is using it to point out the wrongness of the term, not to insult. So B is more likely correct.\n"
