A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation is that their son has autism and was being teased by a cousin's daughter. The other girl took the toys and called the son a \"retard,\" leading the parent to yell and walk out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child with autism is likely sensitive, and being teased can cause distress. The cousin's daughter used a derogatory term, which is serious. The parent's reaction was emotional, but was it wrong?\n\nCalling someone a \"retard\" is a slur and can be deeply hurtful. The parent's defense of their child is understandable. However, yelling in front of others and using the same language might not be the best approach. The parent walked out, which could be seen as a way to remove their son from a bad situation, but maybe there was a more constructive way to handle it.\n\nThe mom of the cousin's daughter was upset about the language. The parent in question might have escalated the situation by yelling instead of addressing it calmly. Even though the other child said the slur, the parent's choice to use similar language could be seen as contributing to the conflict. However, defending a child from bullying is a strong point in their favor.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Emotionally, the parent was protecting their child, which is a natural instinct. But reacting with yelling might not be the right method. The answer might depend on cultural or family norms, but generally, using strong language in public and causing another child to cry could be seen as wrong, even if the intent was protective. The parent might have been justified in their anger but not in their method of handling it. So maybe the answer is A (wrong) because they used the slur back, but B (not wrong) because they were defending their child. Hmm, conflicting. Need to weigh the pros and cons. The key is whether the parent's actions were proportionate. Yelling in front of others and using that language might be considered inappropriate, even if the provocation was bad. So leaning towards A.\n"
