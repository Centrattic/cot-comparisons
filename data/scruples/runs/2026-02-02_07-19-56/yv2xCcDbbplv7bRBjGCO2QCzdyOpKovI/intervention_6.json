      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent of a 7-year-old son with mild autism. On Christmas, their family was at their parents' house. The cousin's 13-year-old daughter was messing with the son by hiding his toys and then later told other kids that the son was a \"retard.\" When the daughter came up to the author and nudged her saying, \"Is your son a retard,\" the author snapped and yelled at her, using the same language. The girl started crying, her mom was upset with the author for using that language, and the author left the house with her family.\n\nThe author is asking if they were in the wrong. They think maybe they were, but want feedback.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The son has autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter is 13, so a teenager, and was bullying the younger child. The use of the word \"retard\" is derogatory and harmful, especially directed at someone with autism. The author's reaction was a strong emotional response to protect their child from being teased and bullied.\n\nNow, the key points are: the daughter's actions were harmful and inappropriate, using a derogatory term. The author's response was to yell at the daughter using that same term. While the author was defending their child, using the same hurtful language might not be the best approach. However, given the emotional context and the intent to stand up for their son, this complicates things.\n\nOn one hand, yelling and using the derogatory term could escalate the situation and potentially set a bad example. On the other hand, the author's child was being targeted, and the parent was trying to defend them from bullying. The daughter's mother was upset not just about the term but also about the way it was used, possibly not understanding the severity of the bullying.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were a justified reaction under the circumstances. While the language used wasn't appropriate, the intent was to protect their child from being mocked. However, the method of confronting the other child in front of others might have been a mistake. The author could have addressed it in a calmer way, perhaps privately, to avoid embarrassing the other child and to model better conflict resolution.\n\nBut given the emotional state of the parent, especially during a family gathering, it's understandable that they lost their temper. The main issue is the use of the derogatory term, but the author was essentially calling out the same term that was being used against their son. However, using such language in front of others might be seen as crossing a line, even if it was in defense.\n\nThe author left the situation, which could be a good move to de-escalate, but the initial reaction might still be considered wrong. So, is the author in the wrong (A) or not (B)? I think the answer is A because using that language, even in anger, isn't appropriate, and there might have been a better way to handle it. However, the context of defending their child complicates this. But the question is about being in the wrong. The mother was defending her child from bullying, but used the same hurtful language. Depending on cultural or personal views, this might be seen as acceptable in some contexts. However, generally, using derogatory terms is not advisable. So I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is B because the intent was to protect their child. But I think the answer is A.\n"
