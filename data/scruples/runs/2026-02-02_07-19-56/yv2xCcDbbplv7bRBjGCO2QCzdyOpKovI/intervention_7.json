A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The context is that the author's son has mild autism, and the cousin's daughter was messing with his toys and calling him a \"retard.\" The author yelled, which caused the girl to cry and her mom to be upset. The author is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's intention was to protect their son from being bullied, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling in front of family, which might have been a harsh reaction. The girl is 13, which is an age where she might understand the impact of her words, but the term \"retard\" is offensive regardless. \n\nThe key points here are the intent to protect a child and the appropriateness of the response. While the author's frustration is understandable, yelling in front of others might not be the best approach. It's possible that addressing the issue calmly or talking to the girl's parents first could have been more constructive. But the girl's use of a derogatory term is definitely wrong, and defending one's child against that is justified.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to their child being bullied, but the method might have been excessive. However, considering the emotional context and the offensive language used by the other child, the author's reaction could be seen as a protective response. The question is whether the yelling was warranted given the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author is not necessarily in the wrong because they were defending their child from a hurtful and derogatory comment. However, the approach might have been inappropriate. The answer depends on weighing the intent and the context. The girl's mother was upset because of the language used, but the author was responding to her daughter's offensive words. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were protecting their child from being bullied, even though the reaction was intense. However, some might argue that yelling wasn't the best method. But given the offensive language from the other child, the author's reaction is more about defending their son's dignity, which is a valid reason.\n"
