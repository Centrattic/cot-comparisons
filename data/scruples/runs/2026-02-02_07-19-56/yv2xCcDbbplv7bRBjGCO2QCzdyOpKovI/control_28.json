A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at another kid for calling their autistic son a \"retard\" during a family gathering.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's son has mild autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in with other kids. The cousin's daughter was taking his toys and hiding them, making him upset. Then she told others that the son was a \"retard\" and said it to the author directly, leading to the author yelling. The girl cried, her mom got upset over the language, and the author left in anger.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. The girl used a derogatory term towards the son, which is offensive and harmful. The author's reaction was to yell, which might be seen as a strong response but is understandable given the context. The key points here are the use of a slur by the child and the parent's defense of their child.\n\nHowever, the author acknowledges that yelling might not be the right approach and is seeking validation. The options are whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI think the author's intent was to protect their child from a hurtful slur. The term \"retard\" is offensive and using it is wrong. The child's actions were at fault, and the parent's emotional response is justified. However, yelling in public, especially in front of family, might have been a poor choice in terms of handling the situation. The parent could have addressed it calmly or talked to the girl's parent first. \n\nBut given the emotional stress of the moment, especially in a family setting during a holiday, the parent's reaction, while not ideal, might be seen as a natural response to protect their child from a derogatory term. The question is about whether the parent is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, yelling isn't helpful. On the other, defending their child from a slur is understandable. Since the girl used a harmful word, the parent's anger is justified. The mother's anger might stem from her own defensiveness when the term is used around her (even though \"retard\" is offensive regardless). However, the parent's action was a direct response to protect their child. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong (B) because they were defending their child from a derogatory term, even if the method was not the best. Alternatively, the yelling could be seen as inappropriate, making the answer A. But the core issue is whether the author was wrong for defending their child. Since the child was targeted with a slur, the parent's reaction is a form of protecting their child, which is understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
