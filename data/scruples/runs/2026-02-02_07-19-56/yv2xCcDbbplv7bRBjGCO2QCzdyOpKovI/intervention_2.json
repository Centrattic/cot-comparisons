A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid during Christmas. The situation involves the author's son with autism being mocked by a cousin's daughter. The kid took the son's toys and made fun of him, calling him a \"retard,\" which led the author to yell.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which makes it harder for him to fit in. The cousin's daughter was teasing him, which caused him distress. The use of a derogatory term like \"retard\" is a big issue here. The author's reaction was to yell, which caused the girl to cry and her mom to be upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, defending their child's dignity is important. The term \"retard\" is offensive and harmful, and the author's outburst might have been a reaction to protect their son. However, yelling in public, especially at another child, could be seen as inappropriate. The mother could have handled it differently, like speaking to the girl's parent first or de-escalating the situation.\n\nBut the key point is the severity of the insult. The girl used a slur, which is a serious violation. The author's reaction, while intense, might be justified given the emotional impact on their son. However, the method of handling it\u2014yelling in front of everyone\u2014might have been unwise, as it could escalate tensions and make the girl's mother defensive.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a reaction to a harmful situation, but the approach might not have been the best. So, there's a mix of justification and fault. However, the use of strong language and the public outburst could be seen as the author's fault. So, answer A (yes, in the wrong) might be appropriate, but there's nuance. Alternatively, considering the context, maybe answer B (not in the wrong) because the underlying issue is the girl's behavior. Hmm, this is tricky. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides carefully.\n"
