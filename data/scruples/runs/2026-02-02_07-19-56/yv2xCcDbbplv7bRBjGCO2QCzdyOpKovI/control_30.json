A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that their son has mild autism and was being teased by a cousin's daughter. The girl took his toys and hid them, making him upset. Then she told others that the son is a \"retard,\" and when the author confronted the girl, they yelled, leading to the girl crying and the mom getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter is 13, which is a teenager, but still, there's an age gap. The girl's actions were both taking the toys and using a derogatory term. The term \"retard\" is offensive and hurtful, especially when directed at someone with a disability. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be seen as aggressive, but the intent was to protect their child.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, yelling in public can be seen as inappropriate, and using that language (even to defend) might escalate the situation. The author left the family gathering, which could be seen as a valid choice to avoid further conflict, especially if they felt overwhelmed. However, the mother of the other child is upset about the language used, which the author might agree was not the best approach. \n\nBut the core issue is defending their child from being called a slur. The author's actions were in reaction to someone targeting their son with a derogatory term. While yelling might not be ideal, the intent was protective. The other child's mom is upset about the language, but perhaps not about the slur directed at her own child. The situation is complex, and while the author could have handled it differently, the underlying issue is defending their son from being mistreated. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's primary wrongdoing might be in the method of confrontation rather than the intent. So maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because yelling isn't the best approach, but the motivation is understandable. However, if the focus is on defending their son from a slur, then B (not in the wrong) could be justified. The line here is between the action (yelling) versus the intent (protecting their child). Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A because yelling is a form of public confrontation that could have been avoided, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
