A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at another kid for calling their autistic son a \"retard.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a 7-year-old son with mild autism, which makes social interactions difficult. At a family Christmas gathering, the cousin's 13-year-old daughter took the author's son's toys and then later called him a slur. The author snapped and yelled at the girl, leading to her crying and her mom being upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: defending their child from a derogatory comment, the daughter's behavior being provoking, and the author's reaction. The question is whether the author was wrong to yell.\n\nI should consider the emotional aspect here. The author's reaction was to protect their child from a hurtful insult. The term \"retard\" is offensive and harmful, especially towards someone with disabilities. The daughter's actions were both taking the toys and using a slur. The author's yelling was a direct response to the slur, which was directed at their child. \n\nHowever, the author left the situation, which might be seen as not addressing the issue calmly. But given the emotional trigger, maybe their reaction is understandable. The mother defending her child's dignity is a strong point. On the other hand, yelling in front of others and leaving could be seen as not handling it the best way, but maybe not entirely wrong.\n\nI should also think about the daughter's age. She's 13, which is a teenager, but maybe she didn't realize the severity of the slur. However, using that language is still wrong. The author's response was to stand up for their son, which is a valid parental instinct. \n\nThe answer might depend on the balance between the provocation and the response. The author's reaction was to the slur, which is a direct attack. Even though yelling isn't ideal, the intent was to protect their child. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that yelling isn't the best approach. But given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because defending their child from a hurtful insult is justified, even if the method isn't perfect.\n"
