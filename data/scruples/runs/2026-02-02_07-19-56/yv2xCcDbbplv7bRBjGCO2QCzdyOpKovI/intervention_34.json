A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The situation is during a family Christmas gathering. The writer's son has mild autism, and the cousin's 13-year-old girl was messing with him by hiding his toys and then calling him a \"retard.\" The writer snapped and yelled at the girl, leading to the girl crying and her mom getting upset. The author is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which makes social interactions tricky. The other child was provoking him by taking his toys and using a derogatory term. The term \"retard\" is offensive and has been replaced with terms like \"person with an intellectual disability,\" so using it is derogatory and harmful. The parent's reaction was to yell at the 13-year-old. \n\nNow, the key points here: the parent was defending their child from being bullied and called a slur. The parent's action was a reaction to protect their son, but they yelled in front of the family. Yelling can be seen as an overreaction, even if the provocation was offensive. However, the parent's intention was to stand up for their child, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent could have addressed the situation calmly, perhaps by talking to the girl's parents about the behavior. Yelling might escalate the situation and could have been hurtful to the 13-year-old, even though the girl was being a bully. The parent left the situation, which might have been a way to de-escalate, but the initial reaction of yelling in front of the family is still a point of contention.\n\nAlso, using the same derogatory language (\"retard\") in the yelling, even to correct the girl, might not be the best approach. The parent could have expressed their anger without using that word, to avoid reinforcing the negative term. The girl's mother was upset about the language, which is a valid concern because it's offensive to others as well.\n\nSo, the parent's action was a knee-jerk reaction to protect their child, which is understandable, but the method (yelling and using the same offensive term) could be considered wrong. However, the context of defending their son from bullying complicates the situation. The parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been better. \n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If we take a strict view, yelling in public and using offensive language might be considered wrong, even if the motive was good. Alternatively, if considering the parent's intent to protect their child, the reaction is more understandable, but still not ideal. \n\nThe answer likely depends on the perspective. If the focus is on the parent's method, A (yes, wrong) might be the answer. If the focus is on the provocation and intent, B (no, not wrong) could be the case. But since the parent used the same offensive language and yelled, which caused the girl to cry and the mother to be upset, the parent's reaction is seen as an overreaction. So, they might be in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn here. The parent was defending their child, but the method was inappropriate. So, the answer could be A.\n"
