A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's cousin's daughter was messing with their autistic son by hiding his toys and then using a derogatory term, \"retard,\" which led the author to yell at the girl. The author is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which makes social interactions difficult. The cousin's daughter, being 13, is old enough to understand the impact of her words. Using the word \"retard\" is a slur and is offensive, especially in a family setting. The author's reaction was to yell, which caused the girl to cry and the mother to get upset. The author then left the situation, feeling conflicted.\n\nOn one hand, the author's defense of their child is understandable. No parent wants to hear their child called names like that, especially when the child has challenges. The term \"retard\" is not only hurtful but also carries stigma. The author's emotional response is a natural reaction to protect their son.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling in front of family and in front of children might not be the best way to handle the situation. It escalated the conflict and could have been more constructive. The author could have addressed the issue calmly after the fact, perhaps speaking to the girl's parents or the girl herself privately to explain why the term is offensive. Yelling might have made the girl feel attacked rather than understanding her mistake.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they left the situation, which shows they felt the tension was too high. However, the immediate reaction of yelling could have been avoided with a different approach. The key here is whether the author's response was proportional to the situation. The derogatory term is a serious issue, so their anger is justified, but the method of response might be where they went wrong.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they should consider teaching their cousin's daughter about respect and the impact of her words, perhaps through a calm conversation rather than yelling. The girl was 13, so a constructive lesson could be beneficial for her growth. However, the term used was extremely offensive, so the author's outrage is understandable.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author's intention was to protect their child, which is right, but the method of response (yelling) might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the author is partially in the wrong for how they handled the situation, but the intent was justified. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the yelling, but the context complicates it. However, typically, in such scenarios, defending one's child against a slur is seen as justified, so maybe B (not in the wrong). But the act of yelling in front of the family and the girl crying might still make people think the author overreacted. Hmm, this is tricky. The key is whether the response was appropriate. Since the slur is a major issue, the author's reaction, while perhaps intense, was in defense of their child. So maybe B is the answer. But I'm not 100% sure.\n"
