A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation is during Christmas with family, and the author's son has mild autism. The cousin's daughter took the son's toys and called him a retard, which led the author to yell.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. The other girl was messing with him by hiding toys and then using a derogatory term. The author's reaction was yelling, which caused the other girl to cry and her mom to be upset. The author feels conflicted, thinking they weren't right but wanted feedback.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, calling someone a derogatory term is hurtful and inappropriate, especially towards a child with autism. The author's anger is understandable given the context. Their son was being targeted and humiliated. However, yelling in front of everyone might not be the best way to handle it. It could have escalated the situation and embarrassed the other child. The mother should have addressed the issue calmly, perhaps by talking to the girl privately or speaking to her parent.\n\nBut then again, protecting one's child is a natural instinct. The author's son was being bullied, and the immediate reaction was to defend him. The problem is the method used. Yelling in public could be seen as overreacting, even if the situation was bad. The other mother's concern about the language used is valid because \"retard\" is a harmful term. However, the root issue is the bullying behavior.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's intention was to protect their child, which is justified. However, the manner in which they reacted\u2014yelling in front of everyone and causing a scene\u2014might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author is in the wrong for how they handled it, but the situation is complex. The key is whether the response was proportionate. The daughter's actions were clearly wrong, but the mother's reaction could have been more constructive. I think the answer is A, but there's nuance here.\n"
