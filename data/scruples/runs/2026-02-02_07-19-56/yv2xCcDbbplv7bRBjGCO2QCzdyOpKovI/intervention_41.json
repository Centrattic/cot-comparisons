A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The author has a son with mild autism, and during a family gathering, the cousin's daughter was messing with the son by hiding his toys and then calling him a derogatory term. The author snapped, yelled at the girl, and left the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has autism, which can make social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter was being cruel, hiding toys and using a hurtful slur. The parent's reaction was to yell, which caused the girl to cry and her mom to get upset. The parent felt they might be in the wrong but isn't sure.\n\nOn one hand, protecting their child from being mistreated is a natural instinct. The use of a slur like \"retard\" is offensive and harmful, especially towards someone with autism. The parent's emotional response is understandable given the situation. However, yelling at a 13-year-old, even if the kid was being unkind, might not be the most constructive approach. It could escalate the situation and teach the child that yelling is an acceptable response to conflict.\n\nBut then again, the parent's son is vulnerable, and the cousin's daughter's actions were intentional and hurtful. The parent might not have had the presence of mind to handle it calmly in the moment. Also, leaving the situation might have been a way to de-escalate things further, though walking out without addressing the issue with the other parent could lead to continued tension.\n\nI should also consider the perspective of the other family. The mother being upset about the language used could indicate that she's sensitive to such terms, perhaps for different reasons. However, the term used by the girl is clearly derogatory, so the parent's frustration is valid. The challenge is balancing immediate reaction with long-term resolution.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The parent's intention was to protect their child, which is right, but the method of yelling and leaving might not be the most effective. However, given the emotional state and the context of a family gathering, maybe it's a situation where both sides had contributing factors. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it more constructively. So, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the core issue is protecting a child from bullying, but it's a judgment call.\n"
