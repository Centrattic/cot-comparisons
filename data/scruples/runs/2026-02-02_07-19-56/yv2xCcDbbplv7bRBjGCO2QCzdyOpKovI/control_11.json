A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The context is that the author yelled at a cousin's daughter for calling their autistic son a \"retard.\" The author is seeking feedback on whether they should feel bad about their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The daughter was messing with the son's toys and then used a derogatory term. The author's immediate reaction was to yell, leading to the girl crying and the mother being upset. The author themselves admit they think it wasn't the right thing to do but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's behavior was hurtful and inappropriate, using a slur against a child with autism. The author's response was an emotional outburst. Now, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of their child being targeted and the emotional stakes involved. \n\nCalling someone a slur is clearly wrong, and the mother was defending her child. However, yelling in public, especially in front of family, might escalate the situation. The question is about the appropriateness of the author's reaction. While defending their child is understandable, the method could be questioned. \n\nIn such cases, some might argue that the mother was right to stand up for her son, even if the approach was harsh. Others might say that yelling isn't the best response and that de-escalation is better. But given the emotional context and the fact that the girl was being intentionally hurtful, the mother's anger is justified. \n\nThe author's own admission that they felt it wasn't right but are seeking validation complicates things. They might be looking for reassurance that their instinct to protect was right despite the method. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because defending a vulnerable child from a derogatory slur is a valid reason, even if the method was reactive. The core issue is the daughter's behavior, not the mother's anger, which was a response to protecting her son.\n"
