A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation involves the author's son with autism being teased and called a slur. The cousin's daughter took the toys and later called the kid a \"retard,\" leading the author to snap and yell. The author walked out, and now they're asking if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which might make him more sensitive or vulnerable. The other child's actions were intentional: hiding toys to upset him, then using a derogatory term. That's pretty hurtful. The author's reaction was emotional, yelling, which caused the other girl to cry and her mom to get upset. The author feels conflicted, knowing they yelled but also feeling justified in defending their son.\n\nNow, laws and social norms vary, but in general, defending one's child from bullying is understandable. However, using yelling could be seen as overreacting, even if justified. The key points are the child's well-being versus the method of response. If the daughter's actions were clearly malicious, the parent's anger is valid. But yelling in front of others might have escalated the situation. Maybe a more measured approach would have been better, like addressing it calmly or talking to the other parents first. However, the use of the slur is a serious issue, so the parent's defense of their child is important. The fact that the other child used a derogatory term is a major factor here. In many cases, standing up against bullying is encouraged, but the method can affect the outcome. The author might be in the right to protect their son but wrong in the way they handled it. However, the answer depends on whether the intent and circumstances outweigh the method. Given the child's autism and the slur used, the parent's reaction is more understandable. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any other angle. The other mom was upset about the language, but the slur was the initial problem. The author was defending their child from a slur, which is a valid reason. However, yelling in front of the family might have been unproductive. But the core issue is the bullying, so the parent's reaction is justified. I think the answer is B.\n"
