      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's cousin's 13-year-old daughter was messing with the author's 7-year-old son with autism by hiding his toys and then calling him a \"retard.\" The author snapped and yelled at the girl, leading to the girl crying and the author's family being upset, with the girl's mom getting angry about the language. The author left the house after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which makes it harder for him to fit in. The cousin's daughter took his toys and made fun of him, which is pretty cruel, especially towards a child who might be more sensitive. The girl's actions were intentional, targeting the author's son, which is a serious issue. The author's reaction was to yell at the girl when she made the slur. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, using such a derogatory term is hurtful and the author was defending their child. On the other hand, yelling in front of others, especially in a family setting during a holiday, might have been an overreaction. The author left the situation, which could be seen as avoiding conflict, but also prioritizing their child's well-being.\n\nI need to think about the appropriateness of the response. The girl was being mean and using a slur, so the author's anger is understandable. However, yelling in public (even at a family gathering) and using the same term (\"retard\") might not have been the best approach. It's possible that a calmer, more constructive response could have been used to address the behavior without escalating the situation emotionally. \n\nAlso, considering the girl's age, 13, she might not fully understand the impact of her words, but the author's son is more vulnerable. The mother's reaction to the language could be because \"retard\" is still considered offensive, even if the author used it in defense. The author might have felt justified, but using that term, even in anger, can be seen as perpetuating the very language they're trying to stop.\n\nAdditionally, the author left the gathering, which might have been necessary for their own and their child's emotional well-being. However, the immediate reaction of yelling might have caused more family tension. The key here is balancing defending their child against maintaining family harmony. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were in response to a hurtful situation, but the method of confrontation might not have been the most effective. They were protecting their child, which is right, but the manner could be questioned. The answer could be a mix of both A and B, but since the options are A or B, I have to choose. If the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" even if the intention was good, the action of yelling might still be considered wrong. So maybe A (yes, in the wrong) because they used offensive language and reacted with yelling. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they were defending their child. Hmm. The user's own thought is that they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. The girl's mom got angry about the language used, so maybe the author's use of the slur, even in defense, was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
