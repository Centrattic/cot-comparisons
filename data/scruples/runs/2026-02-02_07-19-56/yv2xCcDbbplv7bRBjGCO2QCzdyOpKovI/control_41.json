A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves yelling at another kid for calling their autistic son a slur.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's son has mild autism, which might make social interactions harder for him. The cousin's daughter was messing with his toys and then used a hurtful term. The author snapped and yelled, which led to the girl crying and her mom being upset. The author is questioning if their reaction was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, defending their child's dignity is important. The slur used is extremely offensive and can be deeply hurtful, especially to a parent. Reacting emotionally in the moment is understandable given the stress of the situation and the fact that the child has autism, making the insult even more personal.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling in public, especially in front of family and the child, might not be the best approach. It could escalate tension and lead to embarrassment for both the girl and the author. The mother of the girl is upset about the language used, which is a valid concern as well. The author walked out, which might have been a way to de-escalate, but the initial reaction of yelling could be seen as over the top.\n\nHowever, considering the emotional state of the author, the context of their son's condition, and the direct insult targeted at their child, the reaction might be seen as a protective response rather than an unjustified outburst. The use of the word \"retard\" is a slur and the author is defending their child from that term, which could be justified.\n\nBut the method of response\u2014yelling in front of everyone and causing the girl to cry\u2014might not be the most constructive. However, in the heat of the moment, it's understandable. The author's main goal was to protect their child, which is a natural instinct.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the protection of the child justifies the method of response. Since the slur is so offensive and the child is vulnerable, the author's reaction, while not ideal, might be seen as a justified outburst. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
