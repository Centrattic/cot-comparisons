A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person yelled at their cousin's 13-year-old daughter for calling their autistic son a \"retard.\" The author is questioning if their reaction was appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. The cousin's daughter took his toys and then used a derogatory term, which led to the author yelling. The author left the situation because they felt upset.\n\nNow, evaluating the actions. The daughter's behavior was definitely inappropriate. Using a slur like that is hurtful and wrong. The author's reaction was an emotional response to defending their child. While yelling might not be the best approach, the underlying issue is the daughter's use of a derogatory term. \n\nHowever, the author's choice to yell in front of everyone might escalate the situation. Maybe a calmer approach would have been better, but the intent was to protect their son. The mother's reaction to the author's language is also a point. The term \"retard\" is offensive, but in this context, the author was correcting the misuse of the term. The mother of the girl might not see the context and just focus on the language used.\n\nSo, considering all aspects: The daughter was at fault for using the slur. The author's intent was to protect their son, which is valid. The method of reaction (yelling) could be debated, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were defending their child from a hurtful comment. However, maybe there's a balance here. But since the question is if the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No). The main issue was the daughter's behavior, and the author's response, while emotional, was in defense of their son.\n"
