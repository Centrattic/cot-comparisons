A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The situation is during a family Christmas gathering. The author's son has mild autism, and the cousin's 13-year-old daughter is messing with the son by hiding his toys and then calling him a \"retard.\" The author then yells at the girl, which causes her to cry and her mom gets upset. The author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter's actions were malicious\u2014hiding toys and using a derogatory term. The term \"retard\" is offensive and harmful, especially when directed at someone with autism. The author's reaction was in defense of their child, which is understandable. However, yelling in front of others and causing the girl to cry might be seen as a strong reaction.\n\nBut the key here is the intent and the proportionality. The daughter's behavior was intentionally hurtful, and the author was defending their son. While yelling might not be the best approach, the motive was protective. The mother's son has a condition that makes it hard for him, so the daughter's actions were particularly cruel. The author's emotional response is valid given the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like addressing the mother first or calmly confronting the girl. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the daughter was using a derogatory term, the author's outburst might be seen as a justified emotional response, even if not the most constructive method.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the other mother being upset about the language. The term \"retard\" is offensive, but in this case, the author was using it to correct the girl's offensive language. However, the language used by the author could still be problematic, albeit in a different context.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the daughter's actions were clearly wrong, and the author was defending their son. The immediate reaction might be impulsive, but the underlying issue is the harassment of their child. So, while the author could have managed the situation better, they aren't in the wrong for standing up for their son against a derogatory slur.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
