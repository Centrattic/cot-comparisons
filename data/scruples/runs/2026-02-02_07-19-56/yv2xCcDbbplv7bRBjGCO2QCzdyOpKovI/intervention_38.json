A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at another's kid. The situation involves their son with mild autism being teased by a cousin's daughter. The daughter took the toys, hid them, and used a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, then left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which might make him more sensitive to such situations. The other child was messing with his toys and making derogatory comments, which is clearly hurtful. The author's reaction was emotional, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Yelling at a 13-year-old, even if she's being unkind, might not be the best approach. The author could have handled it differently, like addressing the mother first or finding another way to stop the teasing without yelling. However, the situation involved a slur being used on their child, which is a serious issue. The term \"retard\" is offensive and harmful, so defending one's child against that might be seen as protective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author left the situation, which might have been necessary for their own emotional well-being. The mother of the other child was upset about the language used, which is a valid concern since the term is offensive. However, the author's son was the one being targeted, so the parent's outrage is also justified.\n\nI think the key points are the intent and the proportionality of the response. The author was protecting their child from bullying and a derogatory term, which is a justifiable cause. However, yelling in front of everyone and causing the other child to cry might have been an overreaction. The right thing would have been to address the issue without escalating it, but given the emotional state, it's understandable. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. But there's room to say they could have handled it differently. The answer might be B, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
