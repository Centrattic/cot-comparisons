A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for yelling at their cousin's daughter during Christmas. Their son has mild autism, and the cousin's kid was messing with him by taking his toys and hiding them. Then the cousin's daughter said their son was a retard, and the author snapped, yelling at her. The family heard, the girl cried, her mom was upset, and they left.\n\nHmm. So, first, the key points here are the context of the son's autism and the cousin's daughter's actions. The cousin's actions were harmful and intentional. Using a derogatory term like \"retard\" is pretty serious. The author's reaction was emotional, but was it wrong?\n\nOn one hand, defending their child is natural, especially when they are being targeted. The term used is offensive and could hurt the son's feelings. The mother's outburst might have been out of proportion in a public setting, but the intent was to protect her child. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling in front of others and causing a scene could be seen as inappropriate. The cousin's mom was upset about the language, which the author used. However, the term \"retard\" is the one that was used by the other child, not the author. Wait, the author didn't use that language; they just corrected the other child. The mother's yelling was to stop the slur. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction was in defense of their child, even if it was done in a public and emotional way. The cousin's daughter's actions were clearly the wrong here, using a derogatory term. The mother's yelling was a reaction to protect her son from bullying and hurtful language. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No). But maybe some might say A because of the public outburst. However, given the context, the author's intent was protective. So B seems right.\n"
