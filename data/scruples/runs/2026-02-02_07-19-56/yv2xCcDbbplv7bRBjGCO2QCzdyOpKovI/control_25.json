      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The situation involves a 13-year-old cousin's daughter messing with the author's son, who has mild autism. The girl hid his toys and then called him a \"retard,\" which led the author to yell at her. The family is upset, and the author is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter was taking his toys and making fun of him, which would be upsetting for any parent. The term \"retard\" is a derogatory slur, so the daughter's use of that term is definitely wrong. The author's emotional reaction comes from a place of protecting their child, which is a natural instinct.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author was in the wrong for yelling. Yelling can be seen as an escalation, especially in front of others. The mother of the other child took offense at the language used, which makes sense because the parent's response might have been aggressive, even if it was in defense of their son. The author walked out, which could be a good decision to de-escalate the situation, but the initial yelling might have caused embarrassment or hurt feelings for the other child and her mother.\n\nIt's important to balance protecting one's child with maintaining respectful interactions. While the daughter's actions were inappropriate, the author's response involved using similar harsh language. The key here is whether there's a better way to handle the situation without escalating it. Maybe addressing the issue calmly or talking to the other parent privately could have been more effective. \n\nThe author's intention was to protect their child, which is valid, but the method used might not have been the best approach. So, considering all factors, the answer might be that the author is not entirely wrong but could have handled it differently. However, given the context of the slur and the child's disability, the parent's strong reaction is understandable, but the public yelling could be seen as overstepping. So, the answer might be a mix, but since the options are A or B, probably B (not in the wrong) because the parent was defending their child from a slur, but the method was flawed. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The term \"retard\" is a slur directed at a child with autism. The parent's yelling in response, while using similar language, was a reaction to that slur. So maybe the parent's action isn't entirely their fault. But using that language in front of the other child's mother is problematic. Hmm. The answer is likely B, but the parent could have handled it better. The key is that the other child's behavior was unacceptable, so the parent had a reason to react, but the way they did might not be ideal. So, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement.\n"
