A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The situation involves the writer's son with autism being teased by a cousin's daughter. The daughter took his toys, called him a \"retard,\" and the writer snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which might make him more sensitive or have difficulty with social interactions. The cousin's daughter is 13, which is a teenager, so maybe she's testing boundaries or being rebellious. The writer's reaction was to yell at the girl, which led to her crying and the mother getting upset. The writer is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI should think about the appropriateness of yelling. While the daughter's actions were hurtful, yelling in front of others might not be the best approach. However, considering the emotional state of the writer, who was protecting their child, maybe it's understandable. The term \"retard\" is offensive, so the writer's reaction to that is valid. But using that language themselves might have been counterproductive.\n\nAlso, the writer left the situation, which could have been a good decision to de-escalate. But the initial reaction of yelling could have been handled differently. Maybe addressing the issue calmly or talking to the parents first. However, given the emotional context and the fact that their child was being bullied, some might see the yelling as a justified outburst.\n\nI need to balance between the provocation and the response. The girl's behavior was definitely wrong, but the writer's method of responding might not have been the best. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The answer could be A (yes) because yelling might not be the right approach, but also B (no) because they were protecting their child. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the consensus might lean towards A because using harsh language and yelling, even in anger, is not the ideal solution. The writer could have handled it more constructively, so they might be at least partially at fault.\n"
