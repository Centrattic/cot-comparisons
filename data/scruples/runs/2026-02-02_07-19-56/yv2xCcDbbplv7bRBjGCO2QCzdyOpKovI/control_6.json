      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The situation involves the writer's son with autism being teased by a 13-year-old cousin. The cousin took his toys and hid them, then told others that the son was a \"retard\" and taunted the writer. The writer snapped, yelled, and left the house.\n\nFirst, consider the context of autism. The son has mild autism, which might make social interactions challenging. The cousin's actions were clearly hurtful and targeted the son's disability. Using the word \"retard\" is a derogatory term, which adds to the severity of the situation.\n\nThe writer's reaction was an emotional response to their son being teased and called a slur. Yelling in the moment can be seen as a protective reaction, but it's important to assess whether the response was proportionate. The cousin was a teenager; maybe she could have been corrected calmly. However, the writer was likely under stress, trying to protect their child in a family setting where such behavior is not expected from a relative.\n\nThe cousin's mother got upset about the language used, but the original slur was more offensive. The writer's intention was to defend their son, even if the method wasn't ideal. The question is whether the yelling was the right approach. While yelling isn't ideal, the underlying issue of the cousin's behavior seems more problematic. The writer might have acted in the heat of the moment, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the cousin's actions were the root cause. However, the writer's reaction could be seen as a response to defending their child. So, while the writer could have handled it differently, they might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), as the protective instincts are valid, even if the response could have been better managed.\n"
