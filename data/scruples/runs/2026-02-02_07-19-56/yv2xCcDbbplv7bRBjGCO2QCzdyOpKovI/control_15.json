A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author has a 7-year-old son with mild autism. On Christmas, their family is all together. The cousin's 13-year-old daughter is messing with the author's son by hiding his toys, which upsets him. Then the girl uses a derogatory term (\"retard\") about the author's son and seems to provoke the author by nudging them. The author yells at the girl, leading to the girl crying, her mom getting upset, and the author leaving the event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which makes it harder for him to fit in. The other kid was intentionally hiding his toys, which is mean, especially towards someone who might be more vulnerable. Then using a slur like \"retard\" is pretty severe. The author's reaction was out of anger and defense of their child. \n\nBut yelling in front of family and causing the other kid to cry might be seen as overreacting. However, the context of defending their child against bullying is important. Also, the term \"retard\" is a hurtful slur, even if the son only has mild autism. The author's emotional response is understandable given the situation. \n\nThe other parent was upset about the language, but the initial use of the slur by the girl is worse. The author's actions were a direct response to protect their child. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, yelling isn't ideal, but on the other, defending their child from bullying is valid. The post says they know it wasn't the right thing to do, so maybe they're already feeling guilty. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look for whether the action was justified despite being reactive. Since the girl was being a bully, the author's reaction, while intense, was in defense. I think the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because protecting their child from harassment is understandable, even if the method could have been better. The key is that the other child was using a slur and bullying, which is clearly wrong. The author's actions were a response to that.\n"
