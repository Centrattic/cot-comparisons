A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent yelling at another kid for calling their son, who has mild autism, a derogatory term.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's son is on the autism spectrum, which might make him more vulnerable to bullying or sensitive to such behavior. The other child, a 13-year-old, was hiding the toys and then using a hurtful term. The parent snapped and yelled, leading to the other child crying and her mom being upset.\n\nThe parent is conflicted, thinking they might be in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants input. I have to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFactors to consider: \n- The parent was protecting their child from bullying. Using a slur like \"retard\" is offensive and harmful, regardless of the context. \n- The parent's reaction was a direct response to the other child's behavior. Yelling in the moment is understandable, but maybe not the best approach. \n- The other child's mother got upset about the language, which might refer to the parent using the term \"retard\" in their yell. However, the parent was responding to the slur used against their child. \n- The parent left the situation, which could be a responsible action to de-escalate things further.\n\nBut here's the thing: the parent's intent was to defend their child. However, yelling can be seen as aggressive. But given the context of defending against a slur, especially towards a vulnerable child, some might argue it's justified. On the other hand, using that language could have been avoided. However, the parent was reacting to the other child's use of the term, so the parent's use is in response to defend their child. \n\nIn terms of social norms, calling someone a slur is generally unacceptable. The parent's reaction might be seen as defending their child appropriately, even if the method (yelling) was not ideal. But the parent left, which shows they recognized the tension.\n\nI think the key here is whether the parent's use of the slur was justified in response to the other child's use. If the parent didn't use the term but just yelled about it, it might be different. But in this case, the parent said, \"YOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\" So they repeated the slur. That might be where the issue lies for the other parent. The parent's intention was to stand up for their child, but using the same language could be problematic. However, the parent was reacting to a slur being used against their child, which is a serious issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their child. But using the slur might not be the best approach. However, the alternative could be worse. The other parent's reaction is also questionable because their daughter used the slur first. \n\nGiven these points, the parent's action was a reaction to their child being bullied. Yelling might not be ideal, but the core issue is the other child's behavior. The parent's use of the slur was in direct response, so maybe they're not in the wrong. So I lean towards answer B (no, not in the wrong).\n"
