A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at another kid's child. The situation involves the writer's son with mild autism being teased by a 13-year-old cousin. The cousin hid the son's toys and then called him a \"retard,\" leading the author to yell at the girl. The question is whether the author was wrong to react that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which might make him more sensitive or have difficulty handling the teasing. The cousin's actions were deliberate\u2014hiding toys and using a derogatory term. The author's reaction was to yell, which led to the girl crying and her mom getting upset. The author is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, using a slur like \"retard\" is hurtful and inappropriate, especially towards someone with a disability. The author's defense of their child is understandable because they want to protect their son from bullying. Yelling in the moment can be a natural reaction when someone feels their child is being targeted.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling in public and using the same derogatory language might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation and set a bad example for their son. Also, the author left the situation, which might have been necessary to de-escalate things, but the method could be questioned.\n\nI need to weigh intent and consequences. The author's intent was to protect their child, which is a valid concern. However, the method used (yelling with that language) might not be the most effective or appropriate response. The mother of the girl was upset about the language, which could be a point against the author. But considering the daughter's autism and the bullying, it's a complex situation.\n\nI think the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were defending their child from bullying, but they could have handled it differently. However, the user initially thought the author was wrong. The key is whether the response was proportional and appropriate. Yelling with that specific term might be seen as using the same hurtful language, even if in defense. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because the method wasn't the best, even if the intent was good. Alternatively, some might say B because the situation justified the reaction.\n"
