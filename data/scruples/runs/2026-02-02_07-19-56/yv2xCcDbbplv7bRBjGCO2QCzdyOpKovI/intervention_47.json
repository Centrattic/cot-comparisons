A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at a cousin's daughter. The situation involves a 7-year-old autistic son being teased by a 13-year-old girl. The girl took his toys and made derogatory comments, leading the parent to yell. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're defending their child who has autism and might be more sensitive. The parent's reaction is emotional, which is understandable given the situation. The girl's actions were mean, so the parent's frustration is justified. However, yelling in front of others and causing the girl to cry could be seen as overreacting, especially since the parent walked out immediately. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's mother was upset about the language used, which might refer to the parent using the word \"retard\" in their yelling, even though they were correcting the girl's slur. The parent might not have realized the impact of their own language. Also, walking out could be seen as avoiding the conflict rather than addressing it calmly.\n\nBut considering the parent's intent was to protect their child, and the girl's behavior was clearly hurtful, the parent's reaction might be seen as a natural emotional response. However, the method of handling it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be problematic. Maybe there's a middle ground where the parent could express their upset without escalating the situation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while protecting one's child is important, public outbursts can have their own issues. The parent might be right in standing up for their son but wrong in the manner. It's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points, but the parent's approach could be questioned.\n"
