A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after yelling at another kid for calling their autistic son a \"retard.\" \n\nFirst, the context is important. The son has mild autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter was hiding his toys and then used a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, causing the other kid to cry and her mom to get angry.\n\nNow, considering the situation: using a slur like \"retard\" is hurtful and inappropriate, especially towards someone with a disability. The author's reaction was emotional, which is understandable given the insult towards their child. However, yelling in front of others and causing a scene might not be the best approach. But was it the author's fault entirely?\n\nThe key points are the child's disability and the derogatory language. While the other child's actions were wrong, the author's response could be seen as a defensive reaction to protect their son. However, yelling at a 13-year-old might be seen as too harsh, even if the child was being disrespectful.\n\nBut considering the emotional impact on the author's child and the offensive language used, the author might have felt justified in their reaction. The mother's responsibility to defend their child is significant. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling in public\u2014could have been avoided. Maybe a calmer approach would have been better, but the intent was to stand up for their son.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance. The other child definitely started it with a slur, but the author's response might have been excessive. The answer might depend on cultural or social norms. But given that the slur was directed at a vulnerable child, the author's reaction is somewhat understandable. However, the method of response could be questioned. Maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they handled it. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because defending their son against a slur is reasonable, even if the method was harsh. But some might argue A (Yes) because yelling isn't the best approach. But considering the context of defending against a derogatory term, the answer leans towards B.\n"
