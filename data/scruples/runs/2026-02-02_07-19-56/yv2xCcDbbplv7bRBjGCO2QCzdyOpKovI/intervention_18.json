A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation involves a 7-year-old with autism being teased by a 13-year-old cousin. The author's son was upset when his toys were hidden, and then the cousin called the son a \"retard,\" leading the author to yell and walk out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which might make social interactions harder for him, and being teased could be particularly hurtful. The 13-year-old's actions were both hiding the toys and using a derogatory term. The term \"retard\" is offensive and has been widely discouraged, even if someone is using it in a derogatory way. Using that term, even in a defensive or angry response, might not be the best approach, especially in front of family and other kids.\n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which can be seen as losing control, but the provocation was significant. However, yelling in public, especially at a kid, might not be the best way to handle it. The mother of the 13-year-old got upset about the language used, which could be because the author used the same derogatory term. The author then walked out, which might have been an emotional reaction to the situation.\n\nBut the key points here are the use of offensive language and the public confrontation. While defending one's child is understandable, the method of response (yelling the same slur) might be problematic. It's possible that the author was defending their child, but using the same hurtful language could be seen as escalating the conflict and possibly modeling bad behavior, even if it was in anger.\n\nAlso, considering that the 13-year-old is older, maybe the situation could have been handled differently, like addressing it with the parent first or using a more calm approach. The author's intention was to protect their child, but the method might not have been the most effective or appropriate. However, emotional reactions in the moment are common, especially when a parent feels their child is being targeted with a hurtful term.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, while the provocation was real, the author's use of offensive language and the public yelling might place them in the wrong. The answer might be A (in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The author's intent was protective, but the method could be better.\n"
