      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for yelling at their cousin's daughter during Christmas. The main points here are that their 7-year-old son has mild autism and has a hard time fitting in. The cousin's daughter, who's 13, took the toys from the author's son and hid them, making him upset. Then, the girl told the sister's kids that the son was a \"retard,\" and when she confronted the author, the author yelled at her. The author left the situation because they were so upset, and the girl's mom was upset about the language used.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the child's disability and the use of a derogatory term. The term \"retard\" is offensive and hurtful, especially when referring to someone with autism. The author's reaction was a snap response to the girl's insult, which was directed at their child. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for yelling in that moment.\n\nOn one hand, the girl called the child a derogatory term, which is unacceptable. The parent's defense of their child is natural, and using strong language in that moment might be a reaction to protect their child. But the author acknowledges that yelling wasn't the right thing to do, even though they felt justified. The other parent's reaction was about the language used, which could be seen as the author using a derogatory term in return. However, the term the girl used was the actual offensive one, not the author's response. The author's yelling was a reaction to the insults towards their child, so maybe it's more about protecting their child than using offensive language themselves.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how to handle such a situation. While the initial insult is wrong, the parent's response was yelling, which might not be the best approach. However, considering the context of autism and the stress of the situation, some might argue that the parent acted in defense. The answer could depend on cultural or moral perspectives on when yelling is acceptable, especially in protecting a child from bullying. The girl's actions were clearly wrong, but the parent's reaction could be seen as a justified emotional response rather than being in the wrong themselves. The author left the situation, which might be a good decision to de-escalate things, but the yelling could be considered a misstep. However, the main issue was the girl's use of a slur, so the parent's reaction might not be in the wrong.\n"
