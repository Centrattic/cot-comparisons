A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation involves a 13-year-old girl messing with a 7-year-old boy with autism by hiding his toys and then calling him a \"retard.\" The author snapped and yelled, leading to the girl crying and the mother being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter repeatedly provoked him by taking his toys and then using a derogatory term. The author was clearly upset and intervened to protect their son. \n\nOn one hand, using strong language might not be the best approach, especially in front of children. It could model aggressive behavior. Also, the mother of the other child is upset about the language used. \n\nOn the other hand, defending one's child against bullying is a natural reaction. The term \"retard\" is hurtful and degrading, so the parent's anger is understandable. The situation might have escalated because of the provocation, and the parent felt they had to act quickly to protect their son's dignity.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Yelling, even in anger, might not be the right method. However, the intent was to protect their child from being bullied and hurt. The key points are the provocation and the parent's emotional state. \n\nI think the answer might be a bit nuanced. While yelling isn't ideal and there might have been a better way to handle it (like calmly addressing the behavior), the parent's motivation to protect their child is valid. However, in terms of the action taken, using strong language in front of others could be seen as inappropriate. So, the parent might be in the wrong for how they handled it, despite good intentions.\n"
