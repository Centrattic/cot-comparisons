      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is during a family Christmas gathering. The author's son has mild autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in with other kids. The cousin's daughter, who is 13, is messing with the author's son by hiding his toys and then later calls him a \"retard\" to other kids and directly to the author. The author yells at the girl, leading to her crying and her mom being upset.\n\nFirst, the girl's actions are clearly inappropriate. Using a slur like \"retard\" is hurtful and disrespectful, especially when directed at someone's child. The author felt the need to defend their son, which is understandable. However, yelling in front of everyone might not have been the best approach in terms of conflict resolution. But considering the emotional state of the author, maybe it's a reaction to protect their child.\n\nThe key points to consider: Was the girl's behavior warranted? No, she was targeting the son with a derogatory term. Did the author have a right to defend their child? Yes, protecting a child from insults is a parent's instinct. However, yelling might have escalated the situation. The author could have addressed it calmly, but given the stress of the situation and the emotional trigger, it's a common reaction.\n\nAlso, the author left the situation, which might have been necessary to de-escalate things. The mother's reaction to the language is misplaced because the slur came from her own daughter. The author used the same language in anger, which is why the other mom is upset. But the original insult was from the daughter. So there's a question of whether the author's response was proportionate.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to protect their child, which is justified. However, the method (yelling) might not have been the best approach. But considering the emotional context and the daughter's initial provocation, the author's reaction is more about defending their child than being in the wrong. The other mom's criticism is misplaced since her daughter was the one who used the slur. So overall, the author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their child against a derogatory remark. The answer is B.\n"
