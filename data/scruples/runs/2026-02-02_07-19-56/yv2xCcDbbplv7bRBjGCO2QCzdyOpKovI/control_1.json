      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. So the situation is that the writer's cousin's 13-year-old daughter was messing with their 7-year-old autistic son by hiding his toys and then calling him a \"retard.\" The writer snapped and yelled at the girl, which caused her to cry, and the girl's mom got upset at the writer for using that language. The writer is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. The other kid was intentionally hiding his toys, making him upset. Then using a derogatory term, which is hurtful. The writer's reaction was to yell, which is a strong response. But the key points here are the provocation and the defense of their child.\n\nCalling someone a \"retard\" is a slur, even if it's not a direct insult to the person. The writer's child was being targeted, so defending their child is understandable. However, yelling in front of others and using that language might be seen as excessive, especially since the girl was 13, an adolescent, and the writer's reaction caused her to cry and the mother to get angry. The writer left the situation, which might have been a way to de-escalate, but the initial reaction is in question.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, defending a child from being bullied and called a slur is justified. On the other hand, yelling might not be the best approach. However, considering the emotional state of the writer, who has a child with autism, the stress of the situation (Christmas with the whole family), and the provocation, the reaction could be seen as a protective measure. The question is whether the yelling was the wrong action.\n\nThe options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that the writer was protecting their child from a slur and bullying, even if the method wasn't ideal, the intent was to defend their son. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But some might argue that yelling isn't the best approach. However, in the heat of the moment, especially when a child is being targeted, it's a reaction that can be empathized with. Also, the mother's own child was the one using the slur, so the writer's anger is towards the daughter. The mom's reaction to the writer's language might be misplaced, but the original act of calling the child a slur is the main issue. Therefore, the writer's response could be justified as defending their child against bullying.\n"
