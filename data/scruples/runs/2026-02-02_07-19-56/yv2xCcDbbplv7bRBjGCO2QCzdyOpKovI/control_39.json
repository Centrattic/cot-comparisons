      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation involves their son with autism being targeted by a 13-year-old cousin. The cousin hid the toys and then called the son a \"retard,\" leading to the author yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child has autism, which might make social interactions more challenging. The cousin's actions were clearly hurtful, both by taking toys and using a derogatory term. The author's reaction was to yell, which upset the cousin and her mom.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, protecting their child is natural. The term \"retard\" is offensive and harmful, so the author's anger is understandable. However, yelling in public, especially in front of family, could be seen as an overreaction. The mother might have wanted to address the issue calmly to set an example, rather than escalating emotions.\n\nBut also, the cousin's mother is upset about the language used. The author's use of the term \"retard\" in anger might have mirrored the hurtful words, which could be problematic. Even if it's to defend their child, using the same derogatory language might not be the best approach. The author could have expressed their anger without using that term, perhaps to maintain a better example for their son and others.\n\nHowever, the initial provocation was significant. The cousin's actions were malicious, and the term used was a serious slur. The author's emotional response is a reaction to protecting their child from discrimination. In such cases, people often act on instinct, especially when their child is being targeted. The author's intention was to defend their son, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the intent to protect their child, the cousin's harmful actions, and the emotional stress of the situation, it's debatable whether the author was entirely in the wrong. While yelling might not be ideal, the context of defending against a derogatory term and protecting a vulnerable child might mitigate the blame. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance where using the same language could be critiqued. However, the immediate concern was protecting their child, so the author's reaction is more about defense than aggression.\n"
