A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid during a family gathering. The situation involves the author's son with autism being messed with by the cousin's daughter. The cousin's daughter took the toys and used a derogatory term, which led the author to snap and yell.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which can make social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter, at 13, was hiding toys and then using a hurtful slur. The author's reaction was to yell, which caused the girl to cry and her mom to be upset. The author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author was protecting their child from being bullied and using a derogatory term. The slur is offensive and harmful, especially when directed at someone with a disability. The immediate reaction to defend their son is understandable given the emotional context. However, yelling in public, especially in front of family, might have escalated the situation. The author walked out, which could be seen as a way to de-escalate after the fact.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's daughter's actions were clearly inappropriate, and the author's son is vulnerable. The parent's right to defend their child is important. However, using harsh language (\"retard\") and the public confrontation might not have been the best approach. The author might have been justified in their anger but could have handled it differently, like addressing it privately with the girl's parents first.\n\nThe key factors here are intent, the child's vulnerability, and the appropriateness of the response. The author's intention was to protect their son, which is valid. However, the method of response\u2014yelling in front of everyone\u2014might be seen as over the top. But considering the emotional trigger and the hurtful words used by the girl, some might argue the reaction was a justified outburst given the stress of the situation.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the yelling was a proportionate response. The author was protecting their child from a slur, which is serious. The girl's mother might have overreacted to the language, but the original slur was worse. However, public yelling could have been avoided. Maybe the author is partially in the wrong for the method but not the intent. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong overall. Since they did yell and caused a scene, even if justified by the provocation, it's a bit of a grey area. But considering the girl's age and the context, the author might not be in the wrong entirely. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer is B (No) because the parent was defending their child from a hurtful slur, which is a valid reason. The yelling, while not ideal, was a reaction to a provocation.\n"
