A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation involves the author's son with mild autism being teased by a cousin's daughter. The daughter took the son's toys and then used a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, leading to the girl crying and her mom getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which can make social interactions challenging. The cousin's daughter's actions (hiding toys and using a slur) were clearly wrong. However, the author's response was yelling. The question is whether their reaction was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to protect their child from being bullied and insulted. Using a strong term like \"retard\" is offensive and harmful. The author's frustration and anger are understandable given the situation. On the other hand, yelling in front of others, especially in a family setting, might not be the best approach. It could escalate tensions, as seen when the girl started crying and the mother was upset about the language used. The author left, which might have been a good way to de-escalate, but the initial reaction of yelling is where the debate lies.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance. The author's actions were a reaction to their child being mistreated. However, yelling could be seen as an overreaction, even if provoked. It's important to consider whether there were better ways to handle it, like addressing the behavior calmly. But given the emotional context and the child's special needs, the author's response might be more about defending their child's dignity.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's son was being bullied, and the term used was extremely offensive. The author's reaction, while intense, was a defense of their child. However, yelling in public and using strong language could be seen as inappropriate, even if the motive is good. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on how to handle such situations. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a close call. The key is whether the response was proportionate. The daughter's actions were wrong, so defending against that is valid, but the method might be questioned. However, considering the author's intent to protect their vulnerable child, some might argue it's understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reaction was a natural response to protect their child, the method of yelling might be seen as inconsiderate of the broader family dynamics. However, given the context, it's debatable. I think the correct answer might be B (Not in the wrong), because the author was defending their child from bullying and a derogatory slur. However, others might argue that the yelling was excessive. The key point is the intent and the provocation.\n"
