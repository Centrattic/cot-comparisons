A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author was in the wrong for yelling at a cousin's daughter who was making fun of their autistic son. Let me consider the details.\n\nFirst, the cousin's daughter was taking the son's toys and hiding them. That's not great, but kids can be playful like that. Then she called the son a \"retard.\" That's a very offensive term, especially for someone with autism. The author snapped and yelled, which led to the girl crying and the mom getting upset. The author left because they were upset.\n\nOn one hand, the girl's actions were harmful and mean. Using a derogatory term is wrong, and reacting strongly to protect their child is understandable. But yelling in front of others might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author could have addressed the situation differently, like confronting the girl privately or talking to her mom first. However, the situation escalated because of the hurtful language, which could justify an emotional reaction.\n\nThe author admits they feel it wasn't the right thing to do, which shows some self-awareness. But is the reaction the problem, or the fact that the girl was using that language? If the author had a valid reason to protect their child from being mocked and stood up for them, maybe the yelling was a necessary response in the moment. However, using aggressive language might not be the most effective way to teach the girl about respect.\n\nAlso, the mother of the girl is upset about the language used by the author. The term \"retard\" is offensive, but the author used it in the context of defending their child. It's a tricky situation because the term is harmful, but the intent was to protect their son. The girl's mom might not see the intent, only the language used.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions were to protect their son, the method of reacting with yelling and using the same offensive language might be seen as wrong. There could be a better way to address the issue without escalating it. However, the initial provocation (the girl's hurtful words) complicates things. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because defending their child is important, but the approach could have been more constructive. So, maybe the answer is A, but with nuance.\n"
