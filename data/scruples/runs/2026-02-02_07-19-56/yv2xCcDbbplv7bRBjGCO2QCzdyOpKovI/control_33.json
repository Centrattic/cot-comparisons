      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at another child. The situation involves their autistic son being teased by a cousin's daughter, who took his toys and used a derogatory term.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl was messing with the son by hiding his toys, making him upset. Then she called him a slur, which led the author to yell. The key points here are the provocation and the emotional impact on their son. \n\nAutism makes social interactions challenging, and the son might not handle teasing well. The girl's actions were intentional and hurtful. Using a slur like \"retard\" is a serious issue, especially targeting someone with a disability. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling in front of others, causing the girl to cry and her mother to be upset. The author left the situation, feeling it might not have been the right thing to do. \n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Defending one's child from bullying and derogatory language is understandable. However, the method of response\u2014yelling in public\u2014might be seen as reactive. But given the context of the child being targeted, the parent's anger is justified. \n\nThe mother's responsibility to protect her child's well-being is important. The question is whether the reaction was proportionate. The girl's mother was upset about the language, which is a valid point. However, using a slur against someone with a disability is more serious. \n\nIn many cases, defending against bullying is seen as right, but the manner might be questioned. However, considering the emotional state and the situation, it's a gray area. The author's intention was to protect their son, which is a fundamental parental duty. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they were defending their child from a harmful situation. The other side is the use of strong language, but the context of the child's disability and bullying plays a role. The parent's actions, while harsh, were in response to a direct attack on their child's dignity.\n"
