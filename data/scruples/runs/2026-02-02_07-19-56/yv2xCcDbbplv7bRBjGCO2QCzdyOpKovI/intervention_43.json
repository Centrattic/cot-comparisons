A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves yelling at another person's child during a family gathering.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author's son has autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. The cousin's daughter, 13 years old, took the son's toys, hid them, and then called him a slur. The author snapped and yelled at the girl, leading to her crying and her mom being upset. The author is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nThe main points here are the provocation and the response. The cousin's daughter's actions were clearly hurtful and inappropriate. Using a derogatory term like \"retard\" is offensive and harmful. The author's reaction was an emotional response to this provocation. Yelling might not be the best approach, but the context of defending their son's dignity is important. \n\nHowever, the author had a right to be upset. The girl's actions targeted the son's condition, which is a sensitive issue. The author's immediate reaction was to protect their child from bullying. But yelling in public, especially in front of family, could be seen as overreacting, even if justified. The other mom's reaction focuses on the language used, not necessarily the reason behind it. \n\nThe author left the situation, which shows they felt overwhelmed. The key question is whether the yelling was justified given the provocation. While yelling isn't ideal, the underlying issue of the girl's bullying is a major factor. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were defending their son from a slur. However, there might be a better way to handle it, like a calm confrontation. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that yelling isn't the right approach regardless of the provocation. So, the answer isn't straightforward. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intent was to protect their child, which is a valid concern. The other child's behavior was the root issue. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. But the method of response (yelling) could be questioned. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on balancing the provocation against the response. The author's actions were driven by protecting their son from bullying, so they might not be in the wrong. However, the method of response could be seen as excessive. Given the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
