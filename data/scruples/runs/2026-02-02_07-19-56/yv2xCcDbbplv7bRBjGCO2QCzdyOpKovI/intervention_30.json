A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at the cousin's daughter. The situation involves a 7-year-old with mild autism who was being teased and called a \"retard.\" The author snapped and yelled, then left the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child with autism might have sensory or social challenges, making him more vulnerable to such teasing. The cousin's daughter was hiding his toys and then using a derogatory term. The term \"retard\" is offensive and can cause emotional harm, especially if directed at someone with a disability.\n\nThe author's reaction was to yell, which caused the other child to cry and her mom to get angry. The author left the event after being confronted. Now, the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, defending one's child is natural, and the language used by the cousin's daughter was inappropriate. The author's anger is understandable given the situation. However, yelling in front of others and using strong language might not be the best way to handle it. Also, walking out could be seen as avoiding conflict rather than addressing it constructively.\n\nBut considering the context of the child's autism and the hurtful words used, the author's emotional response might be justified. The term \"retard\" is a slur that can be deeply hurtful, not just to the child but to the family. The author's primary goal was to protect their son, which is a parent's duty.\n\nHowever, the method of response might be questioned. Yelling and using the same offensive language (even in anger) could escalate the situation. The mother of the other child felt the language was offensive, which shows that the response was inappropriate in the eyes of others present. The author's decision to leave might have been necessary to de-escalate but could also be seen as abandoning the situation.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intent was protective, the method used could be considered in the wrong because it involved shouting and potentially using offensive language. The key is whether the response was proportionate and constructive. The other child's actions were indeed hurtful, but the author's reaction might not have been the most effective or respectful way to address it.\n"
