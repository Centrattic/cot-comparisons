A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The context is that the author's son has mild autism and was being teased by a cousin's daughter, who hid his toys and used a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, then left the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The cousin's daughter is 13, which is a young teenager. She's hiding toys and using a slur, which is definitely inappropriate. The author's son is vulnerable because of his autism, so defending him is important. The author's reaction was yelling, which made the other girl cry and her mom upset. The author is questioning if they were wrong, even though they feel they weren't.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, defending a child against bullying is understandable, especially when the child can't defend themselves. The term used is offensive and harmful. But on the other hand, yelling at another child, even in defense of their own, might be seen as an overreaction. The author could argue that they were protecting their son, but the other parent might feel that the language used was uncalled for, even if in response to the slur.\n\nThe question is about whether the author was in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. I should consider if yelling was the right approach. Maybe there's a better way to handle it without yelling, but the intent was to protect their son. The family dynamics and the immediate reaction are factors. Also, the term \"retard\" is derogatory and the author's outburst was in response to that. However, yelling might escalate the situation instead of resolving it. The other parent's reaction is about the language used, which could be part of the reason the author was wrong. The author left the situation, which might have been necessary for their son's well-being but could also be seen as avoiding the conflict. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to their son being bullied, but the method (yelling) could be problematic. But maybe the intent is more important here. Since the question is about being in the wrong, perhaps the author isn't entirely at fault because they were defending their child. However, the use of strong language in response to the slur might be seen as using the same kind of derogatory language. Wait, the author didn't use the term \"retard\" themselves, but yelled at the girl for using it. The girl's mom is upset about the language, but the author was objecting to the girl's language. Maybe the mom is upset because the author used a loud or aggressive tone, which could be considered harsh language or behavior, even if the content wasn't a slur. \n\nIn that case, the author might be in the right for standing up for their son but in the wrong for the yelling. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, if the author's action was yelling, which is a form of \"using that language\" (the mother might consider yelling or raised voices as inappropriate language), then maybe the author is in the wrong. Alternatively, if the yelling was a justified reaction to defend their son, then maybe not. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, and the question is to confirm that. The answer options are A or B. Given the scenario, the author's intent was protective, but the method might have been inappropriate. However, in many cases, parents are expected to react strongly to protect their children, even if the reaction is loud. But the other parent is upset about the language, which could refer to the yelling itself, not the term used. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (yes), the author is in the wrong, because even though the intent was to protect their son, yelling in a public family setting could be seen as escalating the situation and using harsh language. The author could have addressed it calmly to de-escalate and teach the other child a lesson without making everyone uncomfortable. However, there's also the argument that protecting their child from bullying is necessary, and the derogatory term used by the girl is a major issue. \n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. The girl used a slur, and the author yelled at her, which might not be the best approach. The right thing to do would be to address the behavior without yelling, perhaps by speaking to the girl's parents first. The author's yelling might have contributed to the situation, so they are partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
