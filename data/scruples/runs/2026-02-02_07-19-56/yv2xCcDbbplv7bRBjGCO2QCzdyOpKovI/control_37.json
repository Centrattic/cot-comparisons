      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: It's Christmas, a family gathering. The author's 7-year-old son has mild autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The cousin's 13-year-old daughter is messing with the author's son by hiding his toys, making him upset. Later, the girl uses a derogatory term (\"retard\") about the author's son, provokes the author by nudging her, and the author yells at the girl. The girl starts crying, her mom gets angry at the author for using that language, leading the author to leave with her family.\n\nThe author is questioning if they were wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). I need to determine which is more appropriate.\n\nLet me consider the key points. The girl's actions were targeted and hurtful. She called the son a derogatory term, which is clearly offensive. The author's reaction was yelling in the moment. However, the author also left the situation, which might be seen as removing the son from a stressful environment. The mother's main concern here is protecting her son from bullying and the use of a slur.\n\nOn one hand, using strong language and yelling might not be the best approach, especially in front of children. But on the other hand, defending one's child against bullying is a natural instinct. The term \"retard\" is a slur that's hurtful and needs to be addressed. The author's son is vulnerable, so standing up for him is important.\n\nThe other parent is upset about the language, but the core issue is the bullying. The author might have handled it differently (e.g., speaking to the other parent first), but the emotional reaction is understandable given the circumstances. The key is whether the action was wrong. Yelling could be seen as a momentary lapse in judgment, but the intent was to protect the child. However, using the same derogatory term in response might not be effective and could escalate things. Maybe the author could have addressed it calmly instead of yelling.\n\nBut considering the context of the child being targeted, especially with a sibling who has autism, the author's reaction is driven by protecting their son. The other parent's reaction seems to focus on the language rather than the underlying bullying. So, in terms of right and wrong, the author's primary goal was to protect their child, which is a valid concern. Yelling might not be ideal, but the intention was positive. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. Answer B (No) seems more appropriate here.\n"
