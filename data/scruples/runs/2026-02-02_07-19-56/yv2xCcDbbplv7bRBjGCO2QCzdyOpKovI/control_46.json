      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's son has mild autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. During a family Christmas gathering, the cousin's 13-year-old daughter takes the son's toys and hides them, making him upset. Then, the girl uses a derogatory term \"retard\" towards the author's son, and when she approaches the author to mock it, the author yells at her. The girl starts crying, her mom gets angry for using that language, and the author leaves.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's actions were both physically (taking toys) and verbally (derogatory term) harmful. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to the girl crying and conflict with her mom.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is wrong. On one hand, defending one's child is natural, especially when the child is vulnerable (autism). The use of a slur is a serious issue. On the other hand, yelling in public might be seen as an overreaction, even if justified. The author left the situation, which could be seen as avoiding confrontation or protecting their child's well-being.\n\nPossible angles: The girl's behavior was inappropriate and hurtful, so the author's defense is understandable. However, yelling in front of others might escalate the situation. But considering the context of a child with autism being targeted, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary stand against bullying. Also, the mother of the other child was upset about the language, but the slur was directed at the author's son. So, the author might not be wrong for standing up for their child, even if the method was confrontational.\n\nAnother angle: The author could have handled it differently, like talking to the girl privately or addressing it with her parents first. But given the emotional state and the derogatory term used, yelling might be a spontaneous reaction. The question is whether the reaction was wrong. Some might argue that using strong language back is not the best approach, but others would see it as justified defense against bullying.\n\nAlso, the author's son's needs and the stress of the situation might have contributed to their stress levels, making the reaction more understandable. The other girl's mom being upset about the language is a conflicting point. \"Retard\" is a slur, so the author's anger is valid because it's about protecting their child from that term. So, the author's use of the term in their yelling could be seen as mirroring the insult, which might be frowned upon, but the intent was to stop the bullying.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. But considering the context of a vulnerable child being targeted with a harmful slur, the author's actions could be seen as justified. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, others might argue that the yelling was an overreaction. But given the circumstances, especially the slur and the effect on their son, the author's reaction is understandable and perhaps necessary.\n"
