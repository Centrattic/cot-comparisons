A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation involves a 7-year-old with mild autism being harassed by a 13-year-old cousin. The cousin takes the boy's toys and hides them, then uses a derogatory term. The author yells at the cousin, causing her to cry, and then leaves in a huff.\n\nFirst, the main point here is the use of the word \"retard.\" That's a harmful and offensive term, especially when directed at someone with a disability. The author's son has mild autism, so the term was not only hurtful to him but also to the author. The mother's reaction was likely driven by a strong emotional response to protect her child from such language.\n\nHowever, the author did yell in front of the family and used the same offensive term in her response. While the intent was to defend her son, using that language, even in anger, could be seen as inappropriate, especially around the cousin's daughter. The mother's outburst might have escalated the situation, leading to the cousin crying and the mother-in-law being upset.\n\nThe author left the gathering immediately after, which could be seen as avoiding the conflict or not taking responsibility for her actions. On the other hand, the cousin's actions were clearly problematic\u2014using a slur and hiding a child's belongings. The mother had the right to defend her son, but the method might have been too harsh.\n\nConsidering the context, the mother's actions were in response to a direct insult toward her child. However, yelling and using the same derogatory term, even if in anger, might not be the best approach. The family dynamics and the fact that it was a holiday gathering could complicate things further. The mother might have been justified in her anger but could have handled it differently, perhaps by addressing the issue privately with the cousin's parents first.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. While the cousin's behavior was inexcusable, the mother's response, especially the use of the slur and the abrupt exit, might not be the most appropriate way to handle it. But her intentions were to protect her son. The key factors are the offensive term used, the public reaction, and the immediate departure without addressing the situation more calmly. Therefore, the answer might be that she's partly at fault, but the context of defending her child plays a role.\n"
