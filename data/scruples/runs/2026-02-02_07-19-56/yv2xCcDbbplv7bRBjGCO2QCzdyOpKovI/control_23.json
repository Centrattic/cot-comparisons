A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their cousin's 13-year-old daughter who called their autistic son a \"retard\" during a family gathering. The author's son has mild autism, which makes it hard for him to fit in. The cousin's daughter was hiding his toys, making him upset, and then used a derogatory term.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son was being targeted, which can be really stressful, especially when a parent is trying to protect their child. The term \"retard\" is a slur now, even if it was once used medically. So someone using that word is definitely in the wrong, especially towards a child with autism. The author's reaction was to yell, which might have been an emotional response. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nThe mother of the cousin's daughter got upset because the author used that language, implying that the author should have used a more appropriate term. But the term \"retard\" was the one used by the other child. The author's intent was to defend their son, so maybe they felt the need to directly address the slur. However, yelling in front of the family might have escalated the situation. The author left, which could be seen as a way to de-escalate, but the immediate reaction of yelling might be considered excessive, especially since it's directed at a teenager. \n\nOn the other hand, defending one's child from being called a slur is understandable. The author's son is vulnerable, and the term is harmful. The mother might have felt that a more controlled approach, like speaking privately to the other parent, would have been better. Public yelling could lead to embarrassment for the other family's child and might not be the best example for their own son. But given the emotional context and the fact that the author's son was being targeted, their reaction might be seen as justified by some. \n\nThe key points are: the other child used a derogatory term, the author's intent was to protect their child, the method was yelling in front of others, and the other parent reacted with anger. The question is whether the author's action was inappropriate. \n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. While protecting one's child is important, yelling might not be the best approach. However, considering the slur used, some might argue that the author had a right to be angry. But the author themselves acknowledges they might have been wrong. \n\nIn many cases, using strong language in anger is seen as a misstep, even if the provocation is wrong. The author could have handled it more calmly. So the answer is probably A, but there's nuance.\n"
