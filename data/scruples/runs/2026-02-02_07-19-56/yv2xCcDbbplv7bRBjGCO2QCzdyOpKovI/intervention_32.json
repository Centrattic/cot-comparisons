A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The situation is that their son has mild autism and during a family Christmas gathering, a 13-year-old cousin's daughter was messing with the son by hiding his toys and then making a derogatory comment. The parent snapped and yelled, leading to the girl crying and her mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent has a child with autism, which might make social interactions challenging. The other child's actions were harmful and included a slur, which is definitely inappropriate. The parent's reaction was to yell, which might be seen as an overreaction in terms of being loud, but the intent was to protect their child from bullying and a hurtful comment.\n\nOn one hand, the parent was defending their child against a derogatory term, which is a serious issue. Using strong language in response could be seen as understandable in the moment. However, yelling in front of others and causing the other child to cry might not be the best approach. The parent's response made the situation escalate, leading to leaving the family gathering, which is a significant consequence.\n\nBut then again, the parent's son was being targeted, and the other child's actions were malicious. The parent's emotional response could be justified given the context. The key here is balancing the right to protect one's child against the appropriateness of the response. Yelling might not be the best method, but the underlying issue of defending against a slur is valid.\n\nThe parent might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their child from bullying and a harmful comment. However, the method of response (yelling) might be questioned. The family's reaction also plays a role\u2014maybe they didn't consider the parent's perspective. So, is the parent in the wrong? It's tricky. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific circumstances. But considering the intent and the severity of the other child's actions, the parent's reaction, while intense, might be seen as a justified defense of their child.\n"
