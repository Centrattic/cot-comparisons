A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The situation involves a 13-year-old cousin's daughter messing with the author's autistic son, hiding his toys, and then using a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, leading to the girl crying and her mom being upset. The author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which makes social interactions harder for him. The cousin's actions were hurtful and targeted the vulnerable child. Using a slur like \"retard\" is a serious issue. The author's reaction was emotional, but was it justified?\n\nOn one hand, yelling in public, especially in front of family, can be seen as overreacting. Using strong language like \"retard\" in response might escalate tensions and set a bad example. However, the author's son was being targeted with a derogatory term, which is a form of bullying. The author's defense of their child is understandable from a protective parent's perspective.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points are the girl's behavior versus the parent's reaction. The girl did say a hurtful word, but the parent's response involved yelling and using the same language. While defending their child is valid, the method might not be appropriate. However, given the emotional context and the child's vulnerability, some might argue it's a justified reaction. The mother walked out, which could be seen as an overreaction too. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's intention was to protect their child from bullying, which is a valid concern. However, the method of response (yelling and using the slur) might be seen as inappropriate. But given the context of the child being autistic and the targeted bullying, the emotional response is understandable. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent was protective, even if the method could be questioned.\n"
