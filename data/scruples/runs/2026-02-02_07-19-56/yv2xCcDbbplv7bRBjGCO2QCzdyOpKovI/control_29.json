Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation involves their son with autism being harassed by a cousin's daughter. The daughter took the toys and later called the son a \"retard,\" leading the author to snap and yell.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has mild autism, which makes social interactions challenging. The other child's actions were both taking his toys and using a derogatory term. The author's reaction was yelling, which caused the other child to cry and the mom to be upset about the language.\n\nNow, the author is questioning if they were wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, yelling might not be the best approach, as it could escalate the situation and teach the child that yelling is an acceptable response. Also, the other child's mother is upset about the language, which is understandable. The author's intention was to protect their son, but their method might not have been constructive.\n\nOn the other hand, the other child's behavior was clearly hurtful and inappropriate. The use of the word \"retard\" is a slur and should be addressed. The author's emotional reaction is understandable given the context of their son's vulnerability. Walking out might have been a way to remove their family from a stressful environment.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. While their intent was to defend their son, yelling in front of others could have been avoided. Maybe a more measured response, like a private conversation, would have been better. However, the situation involved a child being bullied, which is a serious issue. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their child, which is a parent's instinct. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were defending their son against a derogatory term. However, the method of yelling could be questioned. But the core issue is defending against bullying, so the author's action is more about standing up for their child rather than being wrong. So, leaning towards B.\n"
