A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is wrong for yelling at another kid. The situation is that the author has a 7-year-old son with mild autism. On Christmas, the cousin's daughter took the son's toys and hid them, which upset the son. Later, the girl told others that the son was a \"retard\" and then asked the author if that was true. The author snapped and yelled, then walked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's son has autism, which might make it harder for him to handle social interactions. The other girl's actions were mean and targeted the vulnerable child. Using a derogatory term like \"retard\" is definitely hurtful and inappropriate. The author's reaction was to protect their child, which is a natural instinct. However, yelling in front of others and causing the other child to cry might be seen as over the top. \n\nBut wait, the other girl's mom got mad at the author for \"using that language,\" which is confusing because the term \"retard\" is the offensive one. The author was reacting to the offensive language by using the same term, which might have been a mistake. Also, walking out could be seen as abandoning the situation, but maybe they felt it was necessary to de-escalate after the confrontation.\n\nI should evaluate whether the author had a right to be defensive. Protecting one's child is valid, but the method of response is questionable. The girl's actions were clearly wrong, so the author's anger is understandable. However, yelling might not have been the best approach. The mother of the other child was upset about the language used, which the author had a right to be upset about their son being called a \"retard.\" There's a conflict here between defending their child and the method of defense.\n\nIn terms of social norms, calling someone a slur is wrong, but the author was reacting to a slur being used against their son. It's a tricky situation. The girl's mother might not understand the context of the slur and just heard the offensive term. The author might be in the right for defending their child, but the public yelling might have been a poor choice. However, considering the stress of the day and the autism aspect, maybe the author's reaction is more forgivable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The key points are defending their child from bullying and using the same offensive language. The other girl's actions were clearly wrong, so the author's anger is justified. But yelling in a public family setting might not be the best approach. However, given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, but there's nuance here.\n"
