A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at another kid. The author had a cousin's daughter mess with their autistic son, hide his toys, and then use a derogatory term. They snapped and yelled, then left. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, the situation involves a child with autism being targeted. The cousin's daughter was taunting and using a hurtful word. The parent's reaction was to yell. Now, is yelling appropriate? Well, the parent was defending their child from being mocked, which is a strong emotional trigger. But yelling in front of others, especially leading to another child crying and the mother being upset, might not be the best approach. However, the parent's intention was protective, which complicates it.\n\nOn one hand, using strong language and yelling could be seen as overreacting. It's possible to address the situation calmly, maybe by talking to the other child or parents. But on the other hand, the parent's son was being targeted with a slur, which is a serious issue. The parent's emotional response is understandable given the context of autism and the stress of the situation.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. They were trying to protect their child from bullying. But perhaps there's a better way to handle it without yelling. The author acknowledges they weren't in the right, which shows self-awareness. The dilemma here is between the parent's right to protect their child and the appropriateness of their reaction. The answer might depend on perspective. If the parent had a history of aggression, it would be different, but this seems like a single incident. So leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong, but maybe the reaction could have been handled better. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The options are A or B. I think B (not in the wrong) because the core issue is the bullying, and the parent's defense is justified, even if the method wasn't perfect. So I'll go with B.\n"
