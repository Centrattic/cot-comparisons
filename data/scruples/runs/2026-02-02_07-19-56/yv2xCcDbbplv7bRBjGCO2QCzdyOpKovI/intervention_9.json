A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for yelling at another child. The situation involves a 7-year-old son with mild autism who was being teased by a 13-year-old cousin's daughter. The girl took his toys, hid them, and then called him a \"retard.\" The author snapped, yelled at the girl, and left the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has autism, which makes social interactions harder for him. The other child's actions were mean and targeted him, which is hurtful. The parent's reaction was to defend their child, which is a natural instinct. However, yelling in front of others and using strong language might have been an overreaction. The mom of the other child was upset about the language used, which is understandable because the parent's words can reflect on the child.\n\nBut then, the other child used a derogatory term first. The parent's outburst was in response to that slur, which could be seen as standing up for their son. However, yelling and causing the other child to cry might have been inappropriate. The parent could have handled it differently, maybe by addressing the situation calmly to teach the other child a lesson without escalating it.\n\nAlso, the parent walked out, which is a reaction to the family's disapproval. It's possible that their outburst was justified in their mind because of the hurt caused to their son. But using the same derogatory term back might not have been the best approach. The parent's intention was to protect their child, but the method could have been better. So, there's a balance here between defending their child and maintaining composure.\n\nOn one hand, the parent was defending their son from bullying, which is important. On the other hand, the way they handled it might have been inappropriate. The question is whether the parent was in the wrong. If we consider that the child used a slur first, the parent's response might be a defensive reaction. However, yelling and using strong language in front of others could be seen as the parent's fault, even if provoked.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the parent's reaction was proportionate. The child was being targeted, and the parent was upset. But the method of response might have been excessive. So, the parent could be in the wrong for the way they handled it, but not for the intent. The user might be looking for whether the parent's actions were acceptable or not. Since the parent used the same language they were upset about, and caused a family conflict, that could be seen as in the wrong. However, defending a child from bullying is understandable. So maybe the parent is partially at fault but in a complex situation. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B. Given the options, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the situation is complex, the parent's reaction escalated the situation and used inappropriate language despite the provocation.\n"
