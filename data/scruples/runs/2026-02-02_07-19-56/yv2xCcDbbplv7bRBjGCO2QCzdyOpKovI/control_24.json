A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their cousin's daughter teasing their autistic son and using a derogatory term. The author snapped and yelled, then left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son has mild autism, which might make him more sensitive or have difficulty with social interactions. The cousin's daughter is 13, which is a teenage age where they might not fully understand the impact of their actions. The girl took the toys and used a slur, which is clearly hurtful. \n\nThe author's reaction was to yell, which led to the girl crying and her mom being upset. The question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, defending their child is natural, especially when a slur is used. On the other hand, yelling in front of others and walking out might be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut considering the emotional impact of the slur on both the son and the author, maybe the immediate reaction is understandable. The key here is that the girl used a derogatory term, which is offensive and harmful. The author stood up for their child, which is a protective instinct. However, the method might not have been the best\u2014yelling could be seen as aggressive, but the context of defending against a slur might mitigate that. \n\nAlso, the mom's reaction to the author's language is conflicting because the slur was the issue, not the author's response to it. The author's actions were in defense of their child's dignity. \n\nSo, balancing the context, the slur's severity, and the author's protective response, it's more likely that the author wasn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
