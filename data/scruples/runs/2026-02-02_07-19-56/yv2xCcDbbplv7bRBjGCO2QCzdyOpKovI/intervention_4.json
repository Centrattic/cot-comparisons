A little background I have a 7yr son who has mild autism which makes it a little hard for him to fit in with the other kids. Ok back to the story, at one point in the day my cousin\u2019s daughter 13yr was messing with my son by taking his toys that my mother keeps in the house for him and hiding them from him which made him upset. And later on she started making me made by telling my sister\u2019s kids that my son was a, \u201dRetard.\u201d Then came to me nudged me and said, \u201cIs your son a retard so I snapped and yelled at this kid, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T CALL MY SON A RETARD!\u201d All of my family members of course heard me, and the girl started crying. Her mom get mad at me for, \u201cUsing that language around her.\u201d And I was blowing up inside so much that I couldn\u2019t stay so I grabbed my son and husband and walked out with every watching.\n\nIt feels good writing this down and I just want a little feedback on if that was the write thing to do which I know it wasn\u2019t.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for yelling at someone else's kid. The situation involves their son with mild autism being teased, and the cousin's daughter made fun of him by hiding his toys and calling him a slur. The parent then yelled, leading to the girl crying and the mother being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's son is on the autism spectrum, which can make social interactions challenging. The other child's actions\u2014hiding toys and using a derogatory term\u2014are clearly unkind and inappropriate. The parent's reaction is emotional, driven by a desire to protect their child from bullying.\n\nNow, the parent's response was yelling, which could be seen as excessive. However, the trigger was someone calling their child a slur, which is a serious issue. Parents are often expected to defend their children, especially when the child might not be able to stand up for themselves. The parent walked out when they felt overwhelmed, which might be a sign of needing to de-escalate the situation rather than staying and causing more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, using the same slur in response could be problematic, even if it's in defense. The parent's choice of language led to the girl crying and caused tension with the family. The mom might feel that the parent's language was inappropriate, especially in front of children.\n\nBut the core issue here is defending one's child from being bullied. The parent's intention was to protect their son from hurtful language and actions. While the method was confrontational, the motivation was protective. It's a complex situation where emotions run high during family gatherings. The parent might not have been in the wrong, given the circumstances, even if their approach could be questioned.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the parent's actions were a reaction to their child being bullied. The wrong might not lie with the parent but with the other child's behavior. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, even if their response could have been handled better.\n"
