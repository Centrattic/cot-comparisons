Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the co-worker P overheard a private conversation where the author casually mentioned being a lesbian. P then starts asking intrusive questions, some of which are inappropriate and even offensive. The author responds with snark and eventually tells P they don't need his acceptance, which leads to P being upset.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. P's behavior was definitely problematic. Asking personal questions like \"Have you dated other guys?\" and implying the author's last relationship might have failed because they're not out is crossing boundaries. P also gave a self-congratulatory speech after being called out, which seems performative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did respond bluntly. When P was being intrusive, the author's reaction was to shut down the conversation. But was it rude? The author says they didn't care for acceptance and made that clear. They were in a situation where their personal life was invaded, and they had a right to set boundaries. \n\nThe co-workers who were there (A) supported the author, indicating that P was out of line. Another co-worker told the author that P was upset and suggested apologizing, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. P's behavior initiated the conflict. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people have the right to ask for space and not have their private information discussed. The author was defending their privacy and setting a boundary, which is justified. P shouldn't have asked those questions in the first place. The author's response, while maybe sharp, was a reaction to being harassed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were protecting their own space and dignity after being intruded upon. The answer should be B.\n"
