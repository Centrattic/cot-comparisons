  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for saying I don't care or need his acceptance of my sexual orientation?\n  \n\nMy co-worker who I am not very close, nor do I like very much found out I was lesbian because he was eavesdropping into a conversation I was having with another also gay, co-worker (A) a friend of mine. Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not caring about their co-worker's acceptance of their sexual orientation.\n\nSo, the situation is that the co-worker, P, overheard a conversation where the author mentioned being a lesbian. P then started asking intrusive and judgmental questions. The author got annoyed and told P they don't need his acceptance. P was taken aback and later, another co-worker suggested the author should apologize because P was upset. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is part of a marginalized group (lesbian) and faced intrusive questions from a co-worker. P's questions like \"Wow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\" or suggesting that the author's previous relationship issues were due to not being out are clearly inappropriate and invasive. The author felt uncomfortable and responded bluntly, which led to P feeling upset. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's response was justified. P initiated the conversation with unwelcome and personal questions. The author's right to set boundaries is important here. They have the right to not engage and to express that they don't need P's acceptance. The author wasn't aggressive, just direct and snarky, which seems reasonable given the context. \n\nMoreover, P's subsequent \"heartfelt acceptance speech\" came off as performative and insincere. The author's reaction to this was to cut off the conversation, which is a valid response to someone who has already been intrusive and then tries to act overly supportive. The author isn't obligated to accept P's apology or to apologize themselves if they felt disrespected first.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace dynamics. Since the author doesn't have a close relationship with P and doesn't like them, there's less expectation to maintain a positive interaction. The author's priority was to end the uncomfortable conversation, which they did by stating their boundaries clearly.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have responded more politely, even if they were upset. But given P's initial overstepping, the author's reaction is a form of self-defense in social terms. The author isn't wrong for not tolerating invasive questions and asserting their comfort level.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were a reasonable response to P's uninvited and judgmental behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expressing that they don't need acceptance from someone who intruded on their personal life.\n"
