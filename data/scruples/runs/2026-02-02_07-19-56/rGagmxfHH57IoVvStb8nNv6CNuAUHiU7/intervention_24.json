Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not caring about their co-worker's acceptance of their sexual orientation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the co-worker P overheard a conversation and started questioning the author. The questions were pretty invasive and not appropriate. The author didn't take it well and eventually snapped, telling P they don't need his acceptance. P was upset after that. Another co-worker told the author P was really upset and maybe they should apologize. The author is now unsure if they did something wrong.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. P's questions were definitely inappropriate. It's not his place to pry into someone's personal life, especially with comments like \"you don't look lesbian\" or implying the author's previous relationships failed because they weren't out. That's not okay. The author had every right to feel uncomfortable and push back.\n\nHowever, the author's response was blunt and called P out publicly. While P's questions were rude, the author's response might have been harsh. The co-worker mentioned P was upset, and the other co-worker suggested an apology. But the author's response was a reaction to being questioned in a hostile way.\n\nIn social situations, even if someone is being a jerk, responding in a way that's confrontational might escalate things. But in this case, the author was defending their own space and privacy. They had the right to set boundaries. The fact that P was eavesdropping and then prying further with invasive questions makes the situation worse. The author's snap reaction was a response to being put on the spot and having their privacy invaded.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't care about acceptance from others, especially not from someone they don't like. So their statement about not needing validation is legitimate. The key here is mutual respect. P overstepped, and the author stood up for themselves. While the response might have been abrupt, it's understandable given the context. The author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their personal boundaries after being attacked with inappropriate questions.\n"
