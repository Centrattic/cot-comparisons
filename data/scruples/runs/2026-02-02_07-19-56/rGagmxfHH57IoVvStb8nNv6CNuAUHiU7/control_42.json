Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about a co-worker's acceptance of their sexual orientation. The situation involves a co-worker, P, who overheard a conversation and started asking intrusive questions. The author responded bluntly and then told P they don't need his acceptance.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author's main argument is that they don't need anyone's acceptance, especially since their family is homophobic. They were in a work setting, which might mean maintaining professionalism. P's behavior was problematic\u2014asking invasive questions and making comments that came off as judgmental. The author felt uncomfortable and snapped back, which led to P feeling upset.\n\nNow, considering social norms and workplace etiquette. When someone's personal information is discovered without consent, it's important to respect their boundaries. P eavesdropped, which is already a breach of privacy. Then he bombarded the author with questions that were intrusive and possibly hurtful. The author's response was to assert their boundaries, which is a common self-defense mechanism when someone oversteps.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong for not accepting P's \"acceptance\" and for being rude. The author didn't have to apologize because P initiated the inappropriate conversation. The author had the right to set boundaries. However, the tone of the response might be seen as rude, but given the context of P's behavior, it's understandable. In workplace settings, maintaining civility is important, but if someone is harassing or being intrusive, defending oneself is justified.\n\nAlso, the co-worker who told the author that P was upset might be trying to mediate, but the author's actions were a reaction to P's initial misconduct. The author isn't obligated to apologize for protecting their own space. The key here is that P's actions were the root of the problem, not the author's response. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
