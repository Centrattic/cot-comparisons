Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their co-worker that they don't need their acceptance regarding their sexual orientation. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is a lesbian who didn't want to be out at work, especially because their parents are homophobic. A co-worker, P, overheard a conversation and started asking intrusive questions. The author responded bluntly and then told P they don't need his acceptance. P got defensive and tried to be accepting but came off as insincere. The author snapped and said they don't care about his acceptance. Now P is upset, and others think the author should apologize.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down.\n\nP's actions: He eavesdropped, made inappropriate comments, asked personal questions, and made a judgment about the author's previous relationship. That's definitely on him. He overstepped multiple times, showing a lack of respect and understanding.\n\nAuthor's response: The author was initially polite but got more snarky as P kept pushing. When P tried to give a \"heartfelt\" acceptance speech, the author finally said they don't need his acceptance. The author felt justified because they don't need validation, especially given their family situation.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and respect. P violated boundaries by eavesdropping and prying. The author had the right to set a boundary and tell P that his acceptance isn't needed. The author's response was a reaction to P's inappropriate behavior. Even though the author's tone might have been harsh, the root cause is P's misconduct.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone is being intrusive, it's acceptable to assert your boundaries. The author isn't wrong for standing up for themselves after being harassed. The co-worker who suggested apologizing might not see how P contributed to the problem.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. P's behavior was the main issue, so the answer would be B (No).\n"
