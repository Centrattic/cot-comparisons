Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that their co-worker, P, overheard a conversation where the author came out as lesbian. P then proceeded to ask intrusive and offensive questions. The author felt that P was out of line and responded bluntly, saying they didn't need his acceptance. Now, P is upset, and other coworkers are suggesting the author should apologize.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. P overheard the author's conversation with another coworker, A. The author wasn't trying to be outed, but P listened in. Then P starts questioning the author with intrusive questions, which are clearly inappropriate. The author responds with bluntness, which might be perceived as rude. \n\nBut the key points here are: P's actions were intrusive and violating the author's privacy. The author was in a conversation that wasn't meant for P to be part of. P's questions were not only personal but also based on stereotypes (like \"don't look like a lesbian\"). The author's response was a reaction to being harassed, not just being rude. \n\nThe author mentions they don't care about P's acceptance because their family is homophobic, and they keep their personal life separate. So the author's stance is that their sexual orientation doesn't need validation from someone they don't even like. \n\nWhen P starts the \"acceptance speech,\" the author feels that it's insincere and just a way for P to feel good about themselves. The author's snapping was in response to P's overstepping. \n\nIn this context, the author's response seems justified. P was the one who overheard a private conversation and started bombarding them with questions. The author had the right to set boundaries. Being told to apologize might be unfair because the initial intrusion was from P's side. \n\nHowever, the author's response might have been a bit harsh. But considering the context, the author was dealing with a situation where they felt attacked and needed to assert their boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Their response was a reaction to P's inappropriate behavior. \n\nSo the answer is B (no, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
