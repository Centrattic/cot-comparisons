Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about their co-worker's acceptance regarding their sexual orientation. The situation involves a co-worker, P, who overheard a conversation and started questioning the author about their sexuality in a way that was intrusive and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a lesbian who chooses not to disclose their orientation to their homophobic parents. They were in a situation where their privacy was invaded by P eavesdropping. P then proceeded to ask personal and judgmental questions, which the author found offensive. The author's response was to snap and tell P that they don't need his acceptance, which led to P feeling upset and others suggesting an apology.\n\nThe key points here are P's behavior: eavesdropping, making intrusive questions, and invalidating the author's identity. The author's response was a reaction to being harassed. The question is whether the author was wrong in standing their ground and not apologizing.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone is subjected to harassment or intrusive questions, especially about personal aspects like sexuality, they have the right to set boundaries. The author was in a situation where their privacy was violated first. P's questions were not just nosy but also judgmental, suggesting that the author's sexuality might be the reason for past relationship issues. That's pretty offensive.\n\nThe author's co-worker A supported them, and the other co-worker who suggested apologizing might be misunderstanding the power dynamic here. The author was defending themselves against someone who was being intrusive. The author's right to not seek validation from someone who has no right to question them in that manner is important.\n\nLegally and ethically, in many workplaces, there are policies against harassment. P's behavior could be considered harassment, especially if it's creating a hostile work environment. The author's response, while direct, was a justified reaction to being harassed.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it more professionally. But considering the context\u2014P was already eavesdropping and being intrusive\u2014the author's response was a clear boundary setting. The author isn't obligated to accept someone's unwanted acceptance or to apologize for not needing it. \n\nAlso, considering the author's reason for not being out to their parents, the situation adds another layer of stress. They have to navigate their identity carefully, which makes the violation of privacy even more sensitive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author was not in the wrong. They were protecting their personal space and responding to harassment. P's actions were the root of the problem, and the author's response was a necessary boundary.\n"
