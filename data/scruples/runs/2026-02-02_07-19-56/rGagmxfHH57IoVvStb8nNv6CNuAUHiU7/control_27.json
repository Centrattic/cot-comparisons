Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring about their co-worker's acceptance of their sexual orientation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's co-worker P overheard a conversation where they joked about being a lesbian. P then bombarded them with intrusive questions, some of which were judgmental or ignorant, like \"Wow you don't look lesbian!\" and implying the author's past relationships failed because they weren't out. The author, feeling defensive and upset, responded bluntly that they don't need P's acceptance. P got upset, and now others are suggesting the author should apologize.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the dynamics of the interaction. P initiated the conversation with a series of inappropriate and invasive questions. The author's response was a direct reaction to P's behavior. Since the author was not the one who started the conversation, their right to set boundaries is important. \n\nIn social and workplace settings, individuals have the right to privacy and to not face invasive questions about their personal life. P's questions were not only personal but also contained assumptions and judgments. The author's response was a clear assertion of their right to not be judged or required to seek validation from someone who they don't particularly like or consider a close colleague. \n\nMoreover, the author's statement about not needing P's acceptance is a valid stance. Everyone has the right to choose who they share their personal information with and who they seek acceptance from. P's self-congratulatory speech after the questions came off as insincere, especially after the intrusive questioning. \n\nThe author's reaction, while perhaps abrupt, was a justified response to being harassed with inappropriate questions. They were not rude in a malicious way but direct, which is reasonable when someone is crossing boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The responsibility lies with P for overstepping and asking intrusive questions, not the author for defending their personal space and sexuality.\n"
