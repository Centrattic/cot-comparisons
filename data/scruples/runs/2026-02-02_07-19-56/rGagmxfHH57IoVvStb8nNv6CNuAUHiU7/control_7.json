Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after telling their co-worker they don't need their acceptance.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author's co-worker, P, overheard a conversation and then started questioning them in a way that was intrusive and judgmental. Questions like \"Wow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\" and suggesting their previous relationship issues might be due to not being out are clearly crossing boundaries. The author felt more and more upset as the conversation went on.\n\nThen, when the co-worker tried to make a show of being accepting, the author snapped, saying they don't need his acceptance. The co-worker was flabbergasted and later felt upset. The author is now being told to apologize, but they're unsure if they were wrong.\n\nSo, considering the co-worker's initial behavior was problematic and the author was defending their own boundaries, it seems the author had the right to set that boundary. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. They didn't react with hostility beyond stating their position, which is a valid response when someone's questions are intrusive. The co-worker's upset is more about the author not giving the expected deference to his self-proclaimed open-mindedness, not about the author's right to their own stance.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They were setting a boundary after being disrespected. The answer should be B.\n"
