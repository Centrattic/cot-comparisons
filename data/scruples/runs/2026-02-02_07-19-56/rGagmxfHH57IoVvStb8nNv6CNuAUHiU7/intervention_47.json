Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their co-worker that they don't need their acceptance. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a lesbian who was outed by a co-worker, P, who overheard a conversation. P then asked a bunch of intrusive and judgmental questions. The author responded with bluntness and snark, which escalated into the co-worker giving a self-congratulatory acceptance speech. The author then told P they don't need his acceptance, which upset P, and now others are suggesting the author should apologize.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were already in a situation where they felt uncomfortable. Their co-worker was prying and making inappropriate comments. The author's reaction was a defense mechanism against P's intrusive behavior. They were clear that they don't need acceptance from people, especially co-workers, and that they were protecting their boundaries. The author's main concern is maintaining their personal space and avoiding unnecessary conflict, especially since their family is unsupportive. \n\nOn the other hand, P might have thought he was showing support by giving that speech, even if it came off as performative. The author's response was direct and could be seen as dismissive or rude, which might explain why P was upset. However, the key here is whether the author had an obligation to accept P's \"acceptance\" and apologize for not needing it. \n\nThe co-worker, A, supported the author, indicating that P was out of line. Others are now advising the author to apologize, but that might not be fair. The author's boundary-setting was in response to P's overstepping. In such cases, people often feel they need to apologize for standing up for themselves, but it's important to consider that the initial issue was P's inappropriate behavior. \n\nSo, the author's action was a reaction to being harassed, not the root cause. The real issue is P's prying and judgment. The author had every right to set boundaries and express that they don't need validation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They were protecting their personal space and responding to harassment.\n"
