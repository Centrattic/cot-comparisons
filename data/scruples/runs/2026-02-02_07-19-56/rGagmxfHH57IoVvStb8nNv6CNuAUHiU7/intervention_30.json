  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for saying I don't care or need his acceptance of my sexual orientation?\n  \n\nMy co-worker who I am not very close, nor do I like very much found out I was lesbian because he was eavesdropping into a conversation I was having with another also gay, co-worker (A) a friend of mine. Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their co-worker's acceptance of their sexual orientation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a lesbian who didn't disclose this to their co-worker P. P overheard a conversation and then started asking intrusive questions. The author responded bluntly and later snapped when P tried to give an acceptance speech. Then P got upset and others suggested the author apologize.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess. The key points here are about boundaries, respect, and consent to share personal information.\n\nWhen P overheard the conversation, he didn't have the author's permission to bring it up. His questions were invasive and possibly hurtful. The author had every right to feel uncomfortable. The author didn't initiate the conversation; P did. The author's response, while maybe abrupt, was in reaction to being questioned without consent.\n\nAlso, the author made it clear they don't need P's acceptance. Since the author keeps their personal life separate from work, it's understandable they wouldn't want to engage in that discussion. The co-worker's follow-up questions were crossing a line. The author's snapping was a reaction to being disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it more politely. But given the context of P's intrusive behavior, the author's right to set boundaries is strong. The co-worker's self-congratulatory speech after his poor behavior might have been the final straw. \n\nSo, considering that P initiated the problematic interaction, the author's response was about self-respect and boundary-setting. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not needing P's acceptance and asserting their comfort level.\n"
