Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for not caring about a co-worker's acceptance of their sexual orientation.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a lesbian who was outed by a co-worker, P, during a conversation with a friend. P started asking intrusive questions and made some insensitive comments. The author responded bluntly, stating they don't need his acceptance, which led to P being upset. Now, another co-worker suggests the author should apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and respect. When someone's sexuality is discovered without their consent, especially through eavesdropping, that's already a privacy violation. Then, P's questioning crosses into inappropriate territory\u2014questions about dating history, appearance stereotypes, and even suggesting the author's previous relationship issues might be due to not being out. Those are definitely overstepping.\n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary by saying they don't need P's acceptance. That seems like a valid reaction given the context. People have the right to control how their personal information is shared and to whom. The author's bluntness was a response to P's invasive behavior. \n\nP then gave a self-congratulatory speech, which the author rightly points out is unnecessary. The author's frustration led to a sharp reply, but considering P's previous actions, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. The other co-worker's advice to apologize might stem from a place of wanting to maintain workplace harmony, but the core issue is P's initial intrusion and inappropriate comments.\n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, even if not close, mutual respect is expected. The author's response was a reaction to being disrespected first. So, the author isn't wrong for standing up for themselves. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
