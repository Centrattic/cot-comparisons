Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their co-worker that they don't need their acceptance. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the co-worker P overheard a conversation where the author and their friend A were joking about the author being a lesbian. Then P started asking intrusive questions and made some hurtful comments. The author responded with bluntness and eventually told P that they don't need his acceptance. P felt upset and others suggested apologizing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. P eavesdropped on a private conversation, which is already a privacy violation. Then, when confronted with the author's sexuality, P crossed the line by asking inappropriate questions and making judgmental remarks, like suggesting the author's previous relationships failed because they weren't out. That's clearly not okay. \n\nThe author's response was to tell P that they don't care about his acceptance. Considering P's behavior, the author had every right to set boundaries. The key here is whether the author overstepped by being \"rude.\" The author mentions they were blunt and snarky but not rude. P's response was to feel upset and demand an apology. However, the author's stance is that they don't owe their acceptance or validation to anyone, especially someone who intruded on their privacy and made inappropriate comments.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, people have the right to protect their personal space and not tolerate harassment or invasive questions. The author's reaction was a defense against P's overstepping. The fact that P was looking to validate his own acceptance through a self-congratulatory speech adds context\u2014maybe he was more focused on his own image than actually respecting the author's privacy and feelings.\n\nOthers might argue that the author could have responded calmly, but given the situation, the author's right to assert their boundaries is paramount. The question isn't about being polite to someone who has no right to be involved in the first place. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
