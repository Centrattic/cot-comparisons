Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's co-worker, P, overheard a conversation and started asking intrusive questions about the author's sexuality. The author then reacted by telling P they don't need their acceptance, which upset P. The question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way.\n\nFirst, I need to look at what P did. He eavesdropped on a private conversation, then proceeded to ask personal questions that seemed to come from a place of judgment. Like, \"Wow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\" which is a common microaggression. Then he started questioning the author's identity, implying that she might not know she's a lesbian unless she's dated men, which is not valid. Also, suggesting that her previous relationship issues might be due to not being out is pretty hurtful. So P definitely crossed the line with his questions and made the author uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's response was to say they don't need his acceptance. The author was clearly upset and didn't appreciate P's questions. The co-worker A even said P was out of line. The author didn't act rude immediately; they were just being blunt and stopped P from continuing his intrusive questions. When P tried to give a self-congratulatory speech about being accepting, the author snapped. The key here is that P initiated the problematic behavior by eavesdropping and asking inappropriate questions.\n\nSo the author's right to set a boundary here seems valid. They weren't being rude without cause; P's actions were the catalyst. The other co-worker later told the author that P was upset and suggested apologizing, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. P had no right to intrude in the first place. The author's response was a defense of their personal space and identity. \n\nHowever, maybe the way the author expressed their frustration could have been handled differently. Instead of snapping, they could have calmly told P to stop. But given the context of the harassment, the author's reaction seems justified. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and based on P's actions, the author was defending themselves against unwarranted intrusion. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
