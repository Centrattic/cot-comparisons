Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their co-worker they don't need their acceptance. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's co-worker, P, overheard a conversation and started prying into their sexuality with intrusive questions. The author felt uncomfortable and snapped at P when he tried to give a self-congratulatory speech about acceptance. The co-worker later told the author that P was upset and suggested an apology.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's see. P's questions were definitely out of line. Asking someone if they've dated men, implying their sexuality isn't valid because they haven't, and suggesting their past relationships failed due to being closeted is not okay. The author had every right to feel defensive and frustrated. \n\nWhen P tried to give that acceptance speech, it came off as performative and self-serving rather than genuine support. The author's response, while maybe a bit blunt, was a reaction to being pestered. They had the right to set boundaries, especially since their personal life is separate from work. \n\nAlso, the author's reasons for not being open about their sexuality are valid. Family dynamics shouldn't be a point against them. They were just trying to protect themselves in a work environment where they weren't close to P. \n\nThe co-worker who told P was upset might be trying to smooth things over, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong. The key here is whether the author's response was inappropriate. They didn't attack P, just stated they didn't need acceptance. It was a boundary, not rudeness without cause. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were defending their space and feelings after being harassed with unwanted questions. P's behavior was the issue, not the author's reaction. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
