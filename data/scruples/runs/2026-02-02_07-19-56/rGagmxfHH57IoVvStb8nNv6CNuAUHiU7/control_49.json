Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after snapping at their co-worker for prying about their sexual orientation.\n\nSo, the situation is that the co-worker, P, overheard a conversation and started asking intrusive questions. The author felt uncomfortable and finally told P they don't need his acceptance. P then tried to give a self-congratulatory speech about acceptance, and the author snapped, saying they don't care. Now others are saying P is upset and the author should apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that their parents are homophobic, so coming out isn't something they do widely. They were in a work setting, and P eavesdropped, which is already a breach of privacy. Then, P's questions were invasive and even a bit offensive, like implying the author's previous relationships failed because they weren't out. That's not just rude; it's making assumptions about someone's personal life and sexuality.\n\nThe author's response was to tell P they don't need their acceptance. The user is asking if that was wrong. From a standpoint of personal boundaries, the author has the right to set limits on what they're comfortable discussing. P's behavior was the initial problem\u2014his questions were invasive and inappropriate. The author was within their rights to push back against that.\n\nHowever, the way the author responded was blunt. Saying they don't care about P's acceptance might have been a valid response given the context, but the tone could be seen as rude. Yet, given that P's questions were inappropriate and the author was already on edge, the snap reaction is understandable. The key here is whether the author had an obligation to apologize for asserting their boundaries.\n\nAlso, considering that P was the one who started the inappropriate conversation, the author isn't at fault for defending their privacy. The co-workers who suggest apologizing might be missing the fact that P was the one in the wrong first. The author's reaction was a response to being harassed, even if in a work setting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They were responding to a co-worker's invasive and offensive behavior, and their reaction was a reasonable assertion of their boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
