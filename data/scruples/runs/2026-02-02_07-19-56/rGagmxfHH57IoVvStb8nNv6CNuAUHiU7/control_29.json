Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling a co-worker they don't need their acceptance. The situation is that the co-worker, P, overheard a conversation and started asking intrusive questions, then gave a performative acceptance speech. The author snapped, saying they don't care about P's acceptance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's co-worker was eavesdropping, which is already rude. Then P asked inappropriate questions, like \"How do you know you like girls if you haven't dated guys?\" which is invasive and shows a lack of understanding. The author's response was to cut P off and state they don't need acceptance. \n\nThe author's main point is that they don't care about others' acceptance, especially since their family is not accepting. The question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's good to be tolerant, the co-worker's questions were intrusive. The author's response seems like a valid assertion of personal boundaries. They didn't attack P but set a boundary by saying they don't need acceptance. However, the co-worker felt upset, and another coworker suggested apologizing. \n\nBut considering that P was the one who eavesdropped and asked inappropriate questions, the author might have the right to be firm. It's about respecting personal space. The author's bluntness could be seen as necessary to stop the harassment. On the other hand, maybe the author could have been more polite but still firm. However, in this case, the author's response was a direct reaction to being intrusive. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their personal boundaries against someone who was being inconsiderate.\n"
