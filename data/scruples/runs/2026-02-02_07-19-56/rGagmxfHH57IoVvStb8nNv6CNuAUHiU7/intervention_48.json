Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their co-worker that they don't care about his acceptance of their sexual orientation. \n\nFirst, the context: The author's co-worker, P, overheard a conversation and then proceeded to ask intrusive, ignorant questions. The author felt uncomfortable and responded bluntly, telling P that they don't need his acceptance. P then tried to give a performative acceptance speech, which the author snapped at. \n\nSo, the main question is about the appropriateness of the author's response. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, P's questions were clearly inappropriate and invasive. Questions like \"Have you dated other guys?\" or implying that the author's previous relationships failed because they weren't out are not just ignorant but also disrespectful. The author had every right to feel disrespected and to push back against P's intrusive behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was direct and maybe a bit harsh. They told P they don't care about his acceptance, which could be seen as dismissive. However, given the context of P's behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. The key is whether the author's response was a reasonable reaction to being harassed.\n\nAlso, P's subsequent \"heartfelt acceptance speech\" seems more like a performative attempt to look good rather than genuine support. The author's snap was in response to this, which might be justified as they weren't looking for validation. \n\nWorkplace dynamics matter too. The author isn't close to P, and the situation occurred in a bar setting (maybe part of their job?). Maintaining professional boundaries is important, but P crossed a line by prying. The author's right to set boundaries is significant here.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's response, while direct, was a reaction to being harassed and disrespected. They are not in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
