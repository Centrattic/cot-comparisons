Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a co-worker, P, who overheard a conversation about the author being a lesbian. P then starts asking intrusive and inappropriate questions, making the author uncomfortable. The author responds bluntly and eventually snaps, saying they don't need P's acceptance. P gets upset, and now others are telling the author to apologize.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for not caring about P's acceptance and being blunt? The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nFirst, P eavesdropped on a private conversation, which is a breach of privacy. Then he confronted the author with a series of intrusive questions, including some that are clearly out of bounds. Questions like \"Wow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\" and \"Have you dated other guys?\" are not only irrelevant but also offensive and assume heteronormative expectations. P's questions are part of the problem here.\n\nThe author, in response, was initially snarky, which might be a way to deflect the discomfort. When P starts giving a performative acceptance speech, the author snaps, which is a reaction to the prior intrusion. The author's statement that they don't need acceptance is a valid boundary, especially given the context. The author's reasoning is that they don't need validation from someone who found out through eavesdropping and then bombarded them with questions. \n\nAlso, the author's background is that they aren't out to their parents due to homophobia, so the situation is more sensitive for them. Their response was a defense of their autonomy and privacy. P, on the other hand, overstepped by asking personal questions and then feeling upset when the author pushed back. \n\nThe co-workers advising the author to apologize might not see the prior transgressions by P. The author's right to set boundaries is important here. Being rude in response is understandable when someone has been persistently intrusive. So, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
