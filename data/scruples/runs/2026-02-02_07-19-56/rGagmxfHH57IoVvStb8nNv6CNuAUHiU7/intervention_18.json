Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a co-worker, P, overhearing the author's conversation with a friend and then bombarding them with inappropriate questions. The author responds bluntly and then snaps when the co-worker starts a self-congratulatory acceptance speech, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The key points are: P eavesdropped, asked intrusive questions, and then made a long speech about acceptance. The author, who doesn't care about P's acceptance, responds by saying they don't need P's validation. The co-worker later says P is upset and the author should apologize.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's consider the context. The author's co-worker P was eavesdropping and then prying into personal matters. The questions were clearly invasive and rude. The author's response was a reaction to being made uncomfortable. When P tried to give a speech, the author snapped, which might have been abrupt but perhaps justified given the prior behavior.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they don't need acceptance from someone who doesn't matter to them. P's actions were the initial problem. The author was defensive and set boundaries. The question is whether the author overstepped by being rude in response. However, considering P's behavior was unwelcome, the author might have the right to assert themselves. The co-worker's advice to apologize might be from a place of wanting to avoid conflict, but the author's actions were a response to harassment.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because P initiated the intrusive behavior. The author's response was protecting their own boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
