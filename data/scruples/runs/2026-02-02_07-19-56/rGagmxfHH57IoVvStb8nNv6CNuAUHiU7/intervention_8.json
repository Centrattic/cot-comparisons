Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for saying they don't need their co-worker's acceptance. Let's start by looking at the situation.\n\nFirst, the co-worker P overheard a conversation and then started asking intrusive questions. The author was clearly uncomfortable, and P kept pushing, even making some inappropriate comments. The author responded with bluntness, which led to P giving a self-congratulatory speech about acceptance. The author then snapped, saying they don't care for P's acceptance, and now P is upset. Others are suggesting the author should apologize.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess both sides. On one hand, P was the one who initiated the intrusive questions and the judgmental comments. The author had the right to feel disrespected. However, the author's response might have dismissed P's attempt to reconcile, even if it was a bit self-serving. \n\nThe key points here: P's behavior was the initial problem. The author's reaction was defensive and might have been a way to set boundaries. But in doing so, the author could have come off as rude, even if justified. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate. \n\nIn social interactions, even if someone is wrong, responding with rudeness might not be the best approach. However, the author was right to feel that their boundaries were crossed. The author's main point is that they don't need acceptance, which is valid. But P's self-congratulatory speech after being confrontational might have been more about himself than genuine acceptance. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reaction, while maybe blunt, was a response to P's initial overstepping. It's about mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their needs. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
