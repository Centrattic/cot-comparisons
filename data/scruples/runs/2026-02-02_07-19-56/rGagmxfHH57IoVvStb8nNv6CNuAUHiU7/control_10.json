Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author is a lesbian who was overheard by a co-worker, P. P starts asking intrusive questions and makes comments that are pretty judgmental. The author responds bluntly and snarkily, then finally tells P they don't need his acceptance. P gets upset, and another co-worker suggests the author should apologize. The author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. P overheard a conversation, which might already be a privacy issue. Then he confronts the author with a list of questions that are invasive and heteronormative. Phrases like \"You don't look lesbian\" or questioning her past relationships imply that there's a certain way a lesbian should look or act, which is invalidating. The author's response was to be direct and tell P they don't need his acceptance. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether the author's response was appropriate. P's questions were intrusive and part of a \"50 questions\" list, which sounds like stereotyping and prying. The author felt increasingly upset and finally snapped. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring about P's acceptance and responding that way.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone is subjected to invasive questions, especially about their sexuality, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author didn't lash out with rudeness beyond stating their position. They even tried to be blunt and snarky to make P realize he was overstepping. The final response was to assert that they don't need P's acceptance, which is a valid boundary. \n\nP then took it personally and got upset, possibly because his self-congratulatory speech was interrupted. The other co-worker's advice to apologize might be coming from a place of wanting to avoid conflict, but it doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. \n\nThe author's reasons for not being open about their sexuality are personal (family being homophobic) and valid. They don't owe explanations or acceptance from someone who intrudes on their privacy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were defending their privacy and setting boundaries against someone who was being intrusive and judgmental. The answer should be B.\n"
