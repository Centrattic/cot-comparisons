Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they told a coworker they don't care about his acceptance of their sexual orientation. The coworker P overheard a conversation, made some intrusive and inappropriate comments, and then tried to give an acceptance speech. The author snapped back, saying they don't need P's validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned that their family is homophobic, so they might be more sensitive about being outed or judged. P's behavior of eavesdropping and then asking all those personal questions seems invasive. The questions like \"Wow you don't look lesbian!\" and implying that not dating men invalidates their sexuality are definitely not okay. Those kinds of questions can come off as judgmental or offensive.\n\nThe author's response was blunt and snarky initially, but when P started the long acceptance speech, they cut him off. The key here is whether the author's reaction was appropriate given the situation. P's questions were making the author uncomfortable, and the coworker A was also uncomfortable. The author didn't lash out, but when P was being insincere in his acceptance, the author was honest about not needing it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's need to protect their personal information and not seek validation from someone who was being intrusive is valid. P was out of line first, so the author's reaction is a form of setting boundaries. The other coworker's comment that P was upset might not justify the author apologizing, especially if P was the one who initiated the awkward conversation. \n\nSo, considering that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to assert their boundaries and not engage in P's insincere acceptance. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
