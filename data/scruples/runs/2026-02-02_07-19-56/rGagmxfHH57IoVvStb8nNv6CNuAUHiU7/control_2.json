Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for snapping at their co-worker after he made intrusive and judgmental comments about their sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The co-worker, P, overheard a conversation where the author mentioned they're a lesbian. Then P starts asking all sorts of inappropriate questions, some of which are clearly offensive. The author responds with sarcasm and then finally tells P they don't need his acceptance. P gets upset and the author is being told to apologize.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respect. When someone invades your privacy, like eavesdropping, and then starts with the judgmental questions, that's not okay. The author's frustration is valid. They were put in a situation where P was being intrusive, and the author was defending their own space. \n\nAlso, P's behavior seems to be more about showing off his acceptance rather than genuine support. The author pointing out that they don't need his acceptance is a reasonable response after being bombarded with unnecessary questions. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's generally good to be polite, the initial wrong here is on P for overstepping. The author isn't obligated to accept someone's \"acceptance\" if it's insincere or comes after prying. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary, especially in a workplace where personal relationships are more segmented. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
