Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their co-worker P overheard them talking about being a lesbian, and P then started asking a bunch of inappropriate questions. The author responded with snark and ultimately told P they didn't need his acceptance. The co-worker then got upset and the author is now being told to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the actions of both parties. P eavesdropped on a conversation between the author and their friend A. That's already an invasion of privacy. Then P confronts them with a lot of intrusive questions, which are clearly not appropriate. The way P phrases things like \"you don't look lesbian\" or suggesting that the author's previous relationship issues might be due to not being out is both invalidating and offensive. The author was within their right to be uncomfortable and set a boundary.\n\nWhen P tried to do the \"heartfelt acceptance speech,\" it sounds like more of a self-congratulatory monologue rather than a genuine attempt to apologize or understand. The author's response was to tell P they don't need his acceptance. That seems like a reasonable boundary, especially after P's behavior. The author didn't lash out aggressively but instead stated their position clearly. \n\nP's reaction to being told this was to feel upset and then apparently try to make the author apologize through another coworker. It seems like P is the one who initiated the problem by eavesdropping and asking invasive questions. The author was defending their personal space and privacy. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people have the right to set boundaries regarding their personal information and how others interact with them. The author's statement about not needing validation is a legitimate stance, especially considering their family's homophobia. They have valid reasons for keeping their personal life separate. \n\nP's actions were intrusive and judgmental, so the author was justified in pushing back. The fact that P is now upset and wants an apology from the author doesn't necessarily mean the author is at fault. It might mean P is struggling with being called out on their behavior.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They protected their personal space and responded appropriately to P's overstepping.\n"
