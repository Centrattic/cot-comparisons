Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring about their co-worker's acceptance of their sexuality. Let me read through the situation again to understand the context.\n\nThe author's co-worker, P, overheard a conversation where the author joked about being a lesbian. P then started asking intrusive questions, making the author uncomfortable. The author responded bluntly and snarkily, eventually telling P they don't need his acceptance. P was upset, and other colleagues mentioned P was hurt, suggesting the author should apologize.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. The options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the dynamics. P's questions were inappropriate and invasive. Questions about someone's sexual orientation, especially when the person hasn't offered that information, can be seen as crossing a boundary. The author had the right to feel uncomfortable and to set boundaries. The fact that P was eavesdropping in the first place is problematic. The author's response was a direct way of saying they don't need P's validation, which is a reasonable reaction given the intrusion.\n\nOn the other hand, P's intention might have been to express acceptance, but his approach was flawed. However, the author's response came off as rude. But in the context of being harassed with personal questions, the author's reaction is understandable. They were defending their personal space and privacy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that people have the right to their own privacy and to set boundaries. The author isn't obligated to accept P's acceptance; they didn't have to engage with his comments. The co-worker's questions were unwelcome, so the author's response to stop the interaction was appropriate. The colleague who suggested apologizing might not realize how invasive P's questions were.\n\nHowever, the author did respond in a way that could be seen as dismissive or harsh. But considering the situation, the author's need to protect their personal space is more important than being polite to someone who was intrusive. The key here is whether the author overstepped by not apologizing. Given that P initiated the inappropriate questions, the author's response was a boundary-setting action, not an act of rudeness without cause.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
