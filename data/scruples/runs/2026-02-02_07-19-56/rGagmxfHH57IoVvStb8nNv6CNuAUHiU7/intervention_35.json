Now I don\u2019t really care if someone finds out I like women- my life at home and my life at work and everywhere else is very segregated. The only reason I\u2019m not screaming rainbow flags is because my mother and father are quite homophobic, and I am very fond of living in a house haha.  \n\nAnyway, this co-worker (who I\u2019ll call P) overhears me telling A jokingly that I wanted to go to Mardi Gras to find myself a cute wife with strong arms (ya girl has her fantasies ok?) and we can go live on a cattle farm together out in the west. A laughs but before he can say anything P barges in and says \u201cOh you\u2019re a lesbian?\u201d\n\nI tense for a second but laugh it off. \u201cyeah and what?\u201d \n\nP looks at me and decides I\u2019m an eights  ball and asks the 50 questions you ask a gay person: \n\n\u201cWow you don\u2019t look lesbian!\u201d\n\nOk?\n\n\u201cHave you dated other guys?\u201d\n\nNah sucked like 2 dicks and realised it wasn\u2019t for me \n\n\u201cHow do you know you like girls if you haven\u2019t dated guys?\u201d\n\nI dunno P you tell me. Have you ever shagged a dude?\n\n\u201cSo, are you out with your parents?\u201d\n\nNo. \n\nOh, and my favourite: \u201cMaybe your last relationship didn\u2019t work out because you aren\u2019t out? And maybe you like guys?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me in the eyes and said that. \n\nHe really went the 9 yards while A was looking more and more uncomfortable and I was getting more and more pissed. I wasn\u2019t rude, just blunt and snarky enough to get him to realise he was stepping over the line. He probably realised how foot in mouth he was and tried to amend it by doing the whole heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cWell thank you for telling me. I\u2019m really accepting of all people and I know people out there that aren\u2019t and you\u2019re still a great person even if you like girls...ect.\u201d \n\nIt was a long spiel of just I accept you blah blah. Just a circle jerk of self-praise of how open minded he was. Here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t care for anyone\u2019s acceptance over my sexuality. The only people who I ever really wanted to accept won\u2019t. So after 2 or 3 minutes of him talking I snapped. \n\n\u201cMate I know you mean well but I really don\u2019t care what you think of my sexuality. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or validation.\u201d\n\nHe just looked at me flabbergasted before saying something like \u201cwell I was just saying jeez you don\u2019t have to be so rude\u201d before leaving the bar me and A were working at. \n\nAfter that A just hugged me and said P was out of line. However, a few days ago another co worker told me P was really upset with what I said and maybe I should apologise. \n\nSo AITA?  I don\u2019t know maybe he did mean well, but it just wasn't needed. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a co-worker, P, overheard the author saying they're a lesbian and then started asking intrusive questions. The author responded snarkily and eventually told P they don't need his acceptance. P then got upset and others told the author to apologize. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's parents are homophobic, so they might not be out to them. That's a valid reason for not being open. But the co-worker P overheard a conversation and then bombarded the author with questions. That's definitely not appropriate. People shouldn't pry into others' private matters like that, especially in a professional setting. The questions P asked, like \"Have you dated other guys?\" and implying maybe their last relationship failed because they were in the closet, are invasive and judgmental. \n\nThe author's response was to be blunt and tell P they don't need his acceptance. The user thinks that's rude, but maybe it's justified given P's behavior. The author wasn't being hostile initially, just snarky to push back against the questions. When P kept going, the author had a right to set a boundary. Accepting the apology and then being honest about not needing it is a reasonable reaction. \n\nSo, the main point is whether the author overstepped by not accepting P's apology. The author's co-worker A supported them, and the questions were unwelcome. If P was being insincere in his acceptance speech, maybe the author had a right to respond as they did. However, responding after P tried to apologize might be seen as harsh, but given the context, it's more about P needing to stop prying rather than the author needing to apologize. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because P's behavior was inappropriate. The author was defending their privacy and setting a boundary. The snarky comments and final statement were a reaction to P's intrusive and judgmental questions, which are not acceptable in a workplace. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
