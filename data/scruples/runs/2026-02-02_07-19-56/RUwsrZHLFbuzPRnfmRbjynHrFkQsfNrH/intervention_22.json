I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The author describes a situation where their ex-girlfriend, Carol, threatened suicide multiple times during arguments, and finally, after a specific incident where Carol made a comment about the author finding her hanging (like his mother), he yelled at her to go ahead and do it, then left. Now, he's feeling awful and wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's main argument is that Carol's suicide threats were being used manipulatively in arguments, and he was so stressed that he snapped. However, Carol has a history of suicidal behavior, including with a previous partner. The author's response was to tell her to go ahead and kill herself, which is obviously extremely harmful and dangerous.\n\nEven if Carol was using suicide threats as a manipulation tactic, the appropriate response would not be to encourage or wish for her death. The author's reaction could be seen as a lack of empathy and a failure to take her threats seriously, even if they were being misused. People in crisis need support, not hostile responses. The author's comment to \"just do it\" is not only cruel but could potentially push someone toward self-harm or suicide, which makes it a serious issue.\n\nAdditionally, the author's history with his mother's suicide and Carol's family history with suicide might contribute to his emotional state, but that doesn't excuse his response. He should have sought professional help or a safer way to handle the situation, such as removing himself from the argument and encouraging her to seek help. Instead, he escalated the conflict with a harmful statement, which could be considered a betrayal of trust and emotional neglect.\n\nOn the other hand, Carol's behavior is also problematic. Using suicide as a threat in arguments is manipulative and dangerous, and it's clear that she was not in a healthy mental state. However, the author's response was an overreaction that endangered her well-being. The fact that she had a history of this behavior doesn't justify the author's actions, but it does add context to why she acted that way.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is in the wrong because he directly encouraged a harmful action. Even if he was under stress, the way he responded was inappropriate and could have severe consequences. He should have handled the situation with more care, perhaps by addressing the underlying issues in the relationship with therapy or by seeking to end the relationship in a healthier manner without making threats. His comment was not only hurtful but could be seen as a form of emotional abuse.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
