I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The author's ex, Carol, has a history of threatening suicide during arguments. The author initially tried to de-escalate, but over time, this became a pattern. Carol's previous partner also had similar issues, leading to the end of that relationship. The final incident involved Carol making a direct reference to the author's mother's suicide and the author responding with a cruel, encouraging statement, then leaving. Now, the author is staying with his dad, and there's a lot of fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. When someone threatens suicide repeatedly, especially with a history of mental health issues, it's a serious red flag. The author's response to Carol's latest threat was to tell her to go through with it, which is clearly harmful. Even if the author was under stress, responding in a way that could be interpreted as endorsing or enabling the suicidal behavior is problematic. \n\nHowever, the context includes that Carol has a history of using these threats manipulatively, which complicates things. The author might be feeling overwhelmed and desperate, leading to an emotional outburst. But the key point is that the author's response was not supportive and could potentially have contributed to a harmful outcome. \n\nThe author also left the situation, which might have isolated Carol further. While the author might have felt like they needed to leave to protect their own mental health, the way they exited (storming out after a harsh comment) is not a healthy way to handle a crisis. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have recognized the severity of Carol's threats and taken steps to ensure her safety, such as contacting a mental health professional or a crisis hotline. Instead, the author's reaction was to dismiss and antagonize, which is the wrong approach. \n\nEven though Carol's behavior was manipulative, the author's response crossed a line. It's not acceptable to encourage someone to commit suicide, regardless of the circumstances. The author's actions could have had serious consequences, and they bear some responsibility for their words and the subsequent breakdown of the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They failed to respond appropriately to a serious mental health crisis, even if the other person had a history of manipulative behavior. The encouragement to carry out a suicide threat is never acceptable.\n"
