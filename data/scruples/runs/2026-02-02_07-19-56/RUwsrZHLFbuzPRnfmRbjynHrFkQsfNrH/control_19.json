I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is an ex-boyfriend of Carol, who had a history of suicidal threats. The user (the author) is asking if he's a terrible person (AITA) for telling Carol to go through with her suicide threat when she said she'd kill herself to win an argument. \n\nFirst, the background: They met three years ago, both had depression and family histories of suicide. Carol moved in with the author last June, quit her job, and hasn't looked for a new one. This caused friction, leading to arguments where Carol would use suicide threats to end discussions. The author initially tried to reason with her, but over time, it became frustrating. The final incident was when Carol compared the author's mom's suicide to herself, leading the author to yell at her to just do it and leave, then he left. Now he's staying with his dad, ignoring her calls, and facing a Facebook rant from Carol. He's conflicted, feeling like he messed up, but his dad is telling him to cut ties.\n\nSo the key points here are: Carol has a history of using suicide threats as a manipulative tactic, which the author tried to handle for a while. The final breaking point was when she compared the author's mom's suicide to herself. The author's response was to tell her to go ahead, then leave. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a psychological standpoint, encouraging or dismissing someone's suicide threat as a way to end an argument is never acceptable. Even if the person has a history of doing this, it's a serious red flag. The author's response of telling her to \"just do it\" is extremely harmful. It's not only validating the threat but also removing any support she might have had. \n\nHowever, the context shows that the author was under immense stress and had been dealing with Carol's manipulative behavior for a while. The fact that Carol used these threats as a manipulation tactic is a big problem. But regardless of the context, telling someone to carry out a suicide threat is never the right response. It could push someone to actually attempt suicide, which is a life-or-death situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did leave the situation, which might be a form of self-preservation. However, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and telling her to go ahead\u2014was inappropriate. The author should have sought help, like involving a mental health professional, instead of responding in a way that could be seen as encouraging or facilitating the threat.\n\nAlso, moving out and cutting off contact might have been a necessary step for the author's well-being, but the method was wrong. It's possible that the author's own trauma (seeing his mom's suicide) made the situation even worse. However, that doesn't excuse the harmful comment he made.\n\nIn summary, while Carol's behavior was problematic and manipulative, the author's response was inexcusable. He should have de-escalated the situation or sought help instead of responding with a harmful statement. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
