I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author's ex-girlfriend, Carol, has a history of suicidal threats and has been using them during arguments. The author, who has a personal trauma of finding his mother's body, has been enabling her by dropping arguments when she threatens suicide. The final straw is when Carol compares the situation to his mother's death, prompting the author to yell at her to go through with it and leave. Now, the author is in a state of emotional turmoil and has left the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's response to Carol's suicide threats. Even though Carol's behavior is concerning, threatening suicide is a serious matter, and responding with encouragement to act on it is problematic. The author's reaction, while influenced by stress and emotional pain, is a direct response to those threats. However, it's important to note that Carol's threats might indicate a serious mental health crisis that needed intervention, not encouragement.\n\nThe author's statement, \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch,\" directly supports the suicidal threat, which is a major red flag. Even if the author felt overwhelmed, this response is harmful and could put Carol at risk. The appropriate action would have been to seek help for her, perhaps contacting a mental health professional or a crisis line, rather than giving her the green light to act on her threats.\n\nAdditionally, the author's emotional state and history with his mother's suicide might have influenced his response, but that doesn't excuse his words. He still has a responsibility to ensure her safety, even if the relationship is toxic. The aftermath, with her calling him repeatedly and the public accusations, suggests the situation is deteriorating, and his response may have exacerbated it.\n\nOn the other hand, Carol's behavior is also concerning. Using suicide as a manipulative tactic in arguments is a sign of deeper issues that need professional help. However, the author's response is not acceptable regardless of the context. Encouraging someone to follow through on a suicide threat is a serious ethical and legal matter. It's important to prioritize the person's safety, even if the relationship is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while both parties have their issues, the author's direct encouragement of Carol's suicidal threats is a significant misstep. He is in the wrong because his response could have led to real harm and is not a responsible way to handle such a sensitive situation.\n"
