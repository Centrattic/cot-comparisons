I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the ex-girlfriend, Carol, threatened suicide during arguments, and the author responded by telling her to go through with it if she was going to do it. The author then left, and now they're feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that Carol was using suicide threats as a manipulative tactic during arguments, which he found increasingly frustrating and harmful, especially given his own history with his mother's suicide. He felt overwhelmed and finally snapped, telling her to go ahead if she was going to do it. \n\nOn the other hand, Carol's actions\u2014threatening suicide as a way to end arguments\u2014could be indicative of serious mental health issues, possibly even manipulation, but it's important to consider the context. The author mentions that he and Carol both had depression and family histories of suicide, which might mean she's struggling with her mental health. However, the fact that an ex-boyfriend also left due to similar behavior suggests a pattern.\n\nNow, the key point here is the author's response. Telling someone to go through with a suicide threat, even if it's out of frustration, is a serious issue. It's not just about being in the wrong in terms of the argument but the potential real harm. Even if the person is manipulating, responding with such a statement could be seen as callous and potentially dangerous. It's possible that the author, in a moment of anger, said something he didn't mean, but the words are harsh and could have real consequences.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility one has when someone is in distress. The author might feel justified given the manipulation, but from an ethical standpoint, encouraging someone to commit suicide (even sarcastically) is a red flag. The author's own emotional state and history with his mother's suicide might have influenced his reaction, but that doesn't negate the harmful nature of his words.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the author left, stopped communication, and didn't check if Carol was okay. While he was stressed, his actions might have left Carol in a vulnerable state without support. The fact that she's now ranting on Facebook could be her way of coping, but the author's response could have contributed to that.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration with Carol's behavior and the situation's toll on him is understandable. The line between standing up for oneself and being responsible in a crisis is thin here. The author might not be in the \"wrong\" in the sense of being a bad person, but his response was definitely harmful and not appropriate. \n\nIn AITA contexts, people often look for who is morally wrong. Saying \"just do it\" to someone threatening suicide, regardless of the context, is usually seen as wrong. It's important to de-escalate and seek help rather than provoke. The author's actions, while perhaps a breaking point, cross a line. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
