I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup where the ex-girlfriend, Carol, threatened suicide multiple times during arguments, and the author responded by telling her to go through with it, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Carol has a history of suicidal threats, including references to the author's mother's suicide. She also has a family history of suicide. The author mentions feeling stressed and frustrated because Carol quit her job and moved in without contributing. The arguments led to Carol using suicide as a tactic, which the author initially tried to de-escalate but eventually snapped.\n\nThe key point here is the author's response when Carol threatened suicide again. The author told her to go ahead and do it, which is a harmful and dangerous reaction. Even if the author was stressed, encouraging someone to commit suicide is never acceptable. It's a clear violation of their safety and well-being. The author's statement, \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch,\" could be seen as dismissive and potentially pushing Carol toward a harmful action. \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that they were overwhelmed and felt Carol was manipulating them with these threats. They might not have intended to encourage suicide but were acting out of frustration. Still, the line between frustration and harmful behavior is crossed here. The author's words could have serious consequences, and in such situations, the priority should be the person's safety, not the argument.\n\nAdditionally, the author left the situation and cut off communication, which might have isolated Carol further. The dad's reaction to \"burn the bridge\" suggests a need to protect the author, but the author's own actions might have exacerbated the situation.\n\nConsidering all this, even if the author was dealing with their own stress and Carol's manipulative behavior, responding with such a statement is a red flag. It's important to address the underlying issues, like Carol's mental health, through appropriate channels rather than in the heat of an argument. The author's words could be seen as contributing to a dangerous environment, making them at least partially responsible for the situation's escalation.\n\nSo, while Carol's behavior is problematic, the author's response was inappropriate and harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
