I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author (AITA) wrote an article where he's being asked if he's the asshole. The summary is that Carol, the ex-girlfriend, threatened to kill herself multiple times during arguments. The author eventually snapped and told her to go through with it if she wanted, which led to him leaving. Now, he's feeling bad and wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. Carol has a history of suicidal threats, possibly stemming from personal trauma and family issues. The author acknowledges her depression and their shared history. However, instead of addressing her mental health and encouraging her to seek help, he responded with a cruel remark when she threatened suicide. His response was not supportive and could have pushed her to actually follow through. Even if he was frustrated, that doesn't justify making such a comment. \n\nThe key points here are the repeated use of suicide threats as a manipulative tactic by Carol and the author's reaction. While Carol's behavior is concerning and needs to be addressed with professional help, the author's response was harmful. He didn't take her threats seriously in a constructive way; instead, he dismissed her and made a hurtful statement. This is not the right approach. People in crisis need support, not encouragement to act on suicidal thoughts, even if they're being used as a threat.\n\nAdditionally, the author's decision to leave and cut off communication might be a way to protect himself, but his reaction to her threats was inappropriate. He should have encouraged her to seek immediate help or contacted a professional. His father's advice to \"burn the bridge\" might be valid for his own well-being, but the author's comment was definitely wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his response to her suicide threats was harmful and unproductive. Even if his intentions were to put an end to her manipulation, the method was wrong. He should have sought professional intervention instead of responding with a harsh remark.\n"
