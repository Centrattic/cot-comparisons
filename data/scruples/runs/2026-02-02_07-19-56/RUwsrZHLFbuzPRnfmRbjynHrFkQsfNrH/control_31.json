I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main issue here is that the author told their ex, Carol, to \"just do it\" when she threatened suicide. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that Carol has a history of suicide threats, which have increased in frequency and are used to end arguments. He also mentions that she has a family history of suicide and that his own mother died by suicide. However, when Carol makes these threats, he responds with something that's cruel and dismissive, telling her to go ahead and that it would make his life easier. \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, responding to suicide threats with hostility or indifference is problematic. Even if the person has done this before, the appropriate response is to take it seriously and encourage them to seek help. Yelling at someone in crisis and telling them to \"just do it\" is not only hurtful but can push them towards actual self-harm. \n\nThe author's actions led to immediate consequences: he left, she's been contacting him excessively, and she's been ranted on Facebook. His father is taking actions to remove the relationship, which suggests that the author's response was seen as exacerbating the problem.\n\nHowever, the author is also under stress. He's frustrated with Carol's lack of job search and her manipulative behavior. His own history with his mother's suicide might make him feel overwhelmed. But even with that, his response was not appropriate. The key point here is that he didn't take her threats seriously enough and responded in a way that could contribute to her crisis instead of supporting her.\n\nSuicide is a serious matter, and any threat should be taken as a sign to seek professional help. The author's reaction of dismissing her and wishing for her to follow through is definitely in the wrong. Even if he's stressed, the responsibility to respond with empathy and encourage professional intervention is there. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
