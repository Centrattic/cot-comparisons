I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and Carol have a history of dealing with depression and family issues related to suicide. The author's mom committed suicide, and Carol has family members who did as well. That's a heavy background. Now, Carol has been threatening suicide during arguments, which the author initially tried to de-escalate. Over time, these threats become more frequent and are used to end arguments. The author feels frustrated and stressed because Carol isn't looking for a job and relies on him financially. \n\nThe final straw happens when Carol makes a specific threat referencing the author's mom's suicide. The author responds by telling her to go through with it, which leads him to leave. He's been ignoring her calls, and his dad is helping him move out. The author is questioning if he was wrong to respond that way.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's response to Carol's suicide threats. Even though he's under stress, enabling someone's suicidal behavior by telling them to \"just do it\" is extremely harmful. His response, while he might be frustrated, directly contributes to a dangerous situation. It's not about who's right in their personal issues but about the immediate danger posed by his words. Even if Carol has a history of using threats, the author's reaction is not appropriate. He should have sought help, like contacting a mental health professional or a crisis hotline, instead of provoking her. The fact that his ex-boyfriend mentioned similar behavior from Carol shows it's a pattern, but that doesn't justify his response. The author's well-being is important too, but his actions could have led to a tragic outcome. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not handling the situation safely.\n"
