I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points here.\n\nFirst, the author, let's call him Bob, is in a relationship with Carol. Both have a history of depression and family issues related to suicide. Carol has been using suicide threats as a way to end arguments, which Bob initially responded to by backing down. Over time, though, she's escalated, even bringing up the fact that Bob found his mom's hanging body. The final incident was Bob yelling at her to go through with it and then leaving, causing a major fallout.\n\nNow, the question is whether Bob is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical and psychological aspects here. Encouraging someone to commit suicide, even if it's in the heat of an argument, is a serious matter. Saying \"just do it\" can be seen as validating or even promoting self-harm, especially if the person is vulnerable. Carol's history of mental health issues and her ex's similar experiences suggest that she's not bluffing these threats. Bob's response, while coming from a place of stress and frustration, might have crossed a line by not seeking to support her or de-escalate the situation but instead dismissing her pain.\n\nOn the other hand, Bob is clearly stressed and overwhelmed by Carol's behavior. His actions led to him leaving and cutting off communication, which could be seen as self-preservation. However, the ethical obligation towards someone who is in crisis is significant. Even if the threats are manipulative, responding with such a direct encouragement to act on them is problematic. There's also the aspect of not contacting her for support, which might have worsened her mental state.\n\nLegally, in many places, encouraging suicide is against the law. Even if it's not a criminal act, the emotional harm is undeniable. The fact that Bob's own history with his mother's suicide might have triggered his outburst doesn't excuse the response. He should have sought help, maybe contacted a professional or at least ensured she wasn't left in a dangerous state.\n\nIn conclusion, while Bob's situation is complex and he's under a lot of stress, his words and actions directly encouraged a harmful act, which is ethically wrong. Even if his intention was to end the conflict, the method was inappropriate and could have led to real harm. So, the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
