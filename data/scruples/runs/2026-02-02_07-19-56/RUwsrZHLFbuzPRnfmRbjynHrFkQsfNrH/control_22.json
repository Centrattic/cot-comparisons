I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with Carol, who has a history of suicidal threats. Both have depression and family histories of suicide. Carol moved in with the author and hasn't been looking for a new job, leading to arguments. She uses suicide threats to end arguments, and the author initially stopped arguing when she did this. But over time, it's gotten worse. The final straw was when Carol threatened to kill herself in a way that reminded the author of his own mother's suicide. The author then told her to go through with it and left, leading to her calling him over a hundred times and him moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mental health aspects. Suicidal threats are serious, even if someone doesn't follow through. The author's response was to tell Carol to go ahead and do it, which is extremely harmful. Even if he was stressed, responding with such a comment is not acceptable. People in crisis need support, not dismissal or encouragement towards self-harm.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that Carol had been using these threats repeatedly, which might have led to his frustration. However, that doesn't excuse his response. Dismissing someone's mental health struggles, especially when they have a history of suicidal behavior, is dangerous. Encouraging or minimizing suicide is never okay, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe author's father told him to \"burn the bridge now,\" which suggests he approved of the decision to leave, but the comment itself about hoping she does it is problematic. The author might have felt overwhelmed, but his response was not appropriate. It's possible he was in a lot of stress, but that doesn't make his words right.\n\nOn the other hand, Carol's behavior of using suicide as a manipulative tactic is concerning. However, the responsibility isn't on the author to handle that alone. If he felt overwhelmed, he should seek professional help or support for himself, not respond with harmful words.\n\nIn summary, even if the author was stressed or frustrated, telling someone who has a history of suicidal thoughts to go ahead and do it is unequivocally wrong. It's a clear violation of supporting someone's well-being. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
