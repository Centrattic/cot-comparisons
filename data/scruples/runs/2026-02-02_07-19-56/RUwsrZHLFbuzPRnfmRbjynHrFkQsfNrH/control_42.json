I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author's ex, Carol, threatened suicide multiple times during arguments. The author initially tried to de-escalate but eventually snapped and told her to go through with it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Carol's behavior of using suicide threats as a way to end arguments is concerning. It's a serious issue, and the author might feel pressured. However, responding with a harsh comment like \"just do it\" and storming out is problematic.\n\nSuicide threats are not to be taken lightly. Even if they're manipulative, the author's response could be seen as dismissive and potentially harmful. The fact that the ex has a history of suicidal family members and depression adds context, but that doesn't excuse the author's harsh words. The author's reaction might have worsened Carol's emotional state, even if it was a breaking point for them.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to cut off contact completely and not respond to her calls could be seen as abandoning someone in crisis. Even if the author felt overwhelmed, there are better ways to handle the situation, like seeking professional help or setting boundaries without being cruel. The father's reaction to \"burn the bridge now\" suggests that the situation was dire, but the author's approach might not have been the healthiest.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was under a lot of stress and had a history of similar issues with Carol. The fact that Carol's previous partner also had similar problems indicates a pattern. Maybe the author felt trapped and couldn't take it anymore. But that doesn't justify the way they responded.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have taken Carol's threats seriously and possibly encouraged her to seek help instead of provoking her further. Yelling and making a derogatory remark (\"bitch\") is definitely not appropriate. The author's actions could be seen as contributing to a harmful situation rather than showing support.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is in the wrong because they responded in a way that could have been dangerous and didn't handle the crisis appropriately. Even if they felt justified, the method was flawed. The answer is A.\n"
