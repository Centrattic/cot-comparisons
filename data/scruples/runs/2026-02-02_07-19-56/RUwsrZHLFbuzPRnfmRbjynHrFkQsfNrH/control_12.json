I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about the author's ex-girlfriend, Carol, who threatened to kill herself during arguments, and the author's reaction when she made a specific threat related to his mom's death. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Carol has a history of suicide threats, and the author has been trying to handle them by dropping arguments. Over time, this has become more frequent, leading to the author's frustration. The final incident happened when Carol used a personal threat, and the author responded with an angry outburst, telling her to just go through with it, then left. Now he's feeling guilty and is being criticized by his dad and others.\n\nThe key points here are: Carol's repeated use of suicide threats as manipulation, the author's emotional state and response, and whether his reaction was justified. \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, using suicide as a manipulative tactic is a serious red flag. It's not healthy, and it's a form of emotional abuse. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he's been dealing with this for a while. However, his response of encouraging her to follow through on the threat is clearly wrong. Even if the threats are manipulative, responding with something that could enable or provoke actual self-harm is irresponsible. \n\nThe author's statement, \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch,\" is harmful and could push someone to act on those threats. It's not just about the immediate situation but also the potential consequences. Even if Carol was using it as a tactic, the author's reaction crossed a line. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with his own trauma (his mom's suicide) and the stress of the relationship. That adds context but doesn't excuse the harmful words. The appropriate response would be to address the underlying issues, seek help, or set boundaries without making threats that could lead to real harm. \n\nThe fact that Carol's ex mentioned she's done this before suggests a pattern of behavior, which the author might not have fully recognized or addressed. The author's dad advising to cut ties is probably right, as the situation is toxic. \n\nIn summary, while the author was in a stressful and emotionally charged situation, his response of encouraging her to commit suicide is inexcusable and dangerous. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
