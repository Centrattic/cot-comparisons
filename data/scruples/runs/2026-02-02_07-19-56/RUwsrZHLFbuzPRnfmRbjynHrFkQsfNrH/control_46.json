I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex-girlfriend, Carol, has a history of threatening suicide to win arguments. The author mentions that during their relationship, Carol would use these threats, and he initially tried to de-escalate by dropping the argument. But over time, he became frustrated and finally snapped, telling her to go through with it if she was going to do it. That led to him leaving the relationship and now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Carol's behavior of threatening suicide as a way to end arguments is concerning. Threatening self-harm is a serious issue and shouldn't be used as a manipulation tactic. However, the author's response was to tell her to go through with it if she was going to do it. That seems extremely harsh and could be seen as enabling or dismissing her mental health crisis. Even if the author was frustrated, responding with such a statement is dangerous because it could inadvertently encourage harmful actions.\n\nThe author's background includes witnessing his mother's suicide, which might contribute to his emotional state. But that doesn't excuse his reaction. When someone is in a crisis and making suicide threats, the appropriate response is to take it seriously, seek help (like contacting a mental health professional or crisis hotline), and ensure their safety. By telling her to \"just do it,\" the author is failing in his responsibility to support her during a vulnerable time.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Carol has a history of this behavior with past partners suggests there might be deeper issues in her mental health that need professional attention. The author, however, might not have been equipped to handle this, and his frustration led him to respond in a way that's harmful. But even so, threatening someone with suicidal thoughts to follow through isn't acceptable. It's a form of emotional manipulation and can escalate the situation.\n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that Carol is now using the situation to blame him publicly, which adds another layer of complexity. However, the author's actions still need to be evaluated. While he might have been in a stressful situation, his response was disproportionate and could be seen as cruel. The key point is that when someone is in crisis, the proper approach is to not dismiss or encourage their harmful behavior, even if it's used manipulatively.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author might have been under a lot of stress and the relationship had its problems, his reaction was not appropriate. He should have sought to address her mental health issues through proper channels rather than responding with such a provocative statement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
