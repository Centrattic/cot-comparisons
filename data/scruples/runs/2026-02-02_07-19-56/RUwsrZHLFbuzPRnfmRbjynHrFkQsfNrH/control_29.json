I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's ex-girlfriend, Carol, threatening suicide during arguments. The author, who has a history of his mother's suicide, initially tried to de-escalate by backing down, but eventually snapped and told her to go through with it if she was going to say that.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. From a psychological perspective, threatening suicide is a serious red flag. The author mentions that Carol has done this multiple times, even using it to end arguments, which indicates manipulation or a lack of genuine intent to carry through, but still a dangerous behavior. The author's response was to yell at her to \"just do it\" and leave, which seems like a clear escalation and could be seen as harmful, even if the author is stressed.\n\nHowever, the author's background with his mother's suicide might contribute to his stress levels. But that doesn't excuse his response. The key issue here is how to handle someone threatening suicide. The appropriate response is to take it seriously, ensure their safety, and seek help, not to encourage or dismiss the threat. The author's reaction could potentially worsen Carol's mental state and lead to real harm. Even if the author feels overwhelmed, yelling at someone to commit suicide is never acceptable.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Carol's ex mentioned similar behavior in the past suggests a pattern, which the author might have been aware of but still continued the relationship. The author's decision to leave and cut contact might be justified due to the toxicity, but the way he ended it by encouraging suicide is problematic. The emotional distress the author is experiencing is valid, but reacting in a way that could contribute to harm is where they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions during the argument were inappropriate and could be seen as in the wrong, even if the situation was difficult. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
