I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, let's call him John, is in a relationship with Carol. They both have histories of depression and suicide in their families. Carol moved in with John, quit her job, and hasn't looked for a new one. This is causing friction because John expects her to contribute, but she's not. They argue a lot, and Carol often threatens to kill herself to end arguments. John initially stopped arguing when she said that, but she's done it more frequently. Now, when he doesn't drop the argument, she accuses him of wanting her to kill herself. \n\nThe breaking point was when Carol threatened to kill herself in a way that referenced John's past\u2014his mom's suicide. John yelled at her, told her to go through with it, and left. He's been staying with his dad, ignoring her calls, and his dad is helping him move out. Carol is now ranting on Facebook that John left because he didn't love her. John is feeling guilty and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether John is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, Carol's behavior. Threatening suicide as a way to end arguments is a serious issue. It's manipulative and harmful. If someone is truly suicidal, that's a crisis, but when it's used as a tactic in arguments, it's a red flag. However, even if it's manipulative, the person making the threat is still in a vulnerable place. But Carol's history with suicide in her family and her own depression adds complexity. \n\nJohn's response was to tell her to go through with it. That's a direct provocation. Even if he was upset, saying something like \"just do it\" is extremely harmful. It could be seen as encouraging self-harm, which is a legal and ethical issue. But maybe John was so stressed that he lost control. \n\nJohn's own history with his mother's suicide might be affecting him. Carol's threat about being found hanging like his mom could have triggered him. Still, his response was to yell at her to do it, which is not acceptable. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the ex-boyfriend's input. Carol's pattern of behavior isn't new. She used similar tactics before. That suggests a pattern of abusive or manipulative behavior. \n\nJohn's actions\u2014storming out, taking his dad's advice to move out, ignoring her calls\u2014could be seen as cutting her off, which might be necessary for his mental health. But the way he reacted in the moment (yelling at her to kill herself) is definitely crossing a line. \n\nEven if Carol's behavior is problematic, responding with a direct threat to let her do it is not okay. People in crisis need support, not encouragement to act on harmful impulses. John's statement could be seen as contributing to a dangerous situation. \n\nHowever, the situation is complex. John was dealing with a lot of stress, her manipulative behavior, and his own trauma. But that doesn't excuse his response. The key point here is that even if the person is manipulative, threatening suicide is a serious matter, and telling someone to go through with it is a major problem. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong). Because of the harmful statement he made, regardless of the context.\n"
