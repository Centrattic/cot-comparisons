I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (let's call him John) is in a relationship with Carol, who has a history of depression and family suicide issues. They've been arguing a lot, and Carol frequently threatens suicide to end arguments. John starts ignoring her threats, then at a breaking point, he yells at her to go through with it if she's going to do it, which is a clear and harmful response. He leaves and refuses to talk to her, leading to further issues.\n\nSo, the key points here. Carol's behavior is concerning. Threatening suicide, especially when she has a history of mental health issues, is a red flag. But John's response is problematic. Telling someone to \"just do it\" and wishing them to commit suicide is not only cruel but dangerous. Even if he was frustrated, responding with such a statement shows a lack of empathy and understanding. He should have taken it seriously and maybe sought help for her, like encouraging her to talk to a professional or contacting someone who could intervene.\n\nJohn's actions led to him cutting her off completely, which is understandable given the stress, but the way he handled it was harsh. He also didn't consider the immediate danger his words might pose to Carol. His father's reaction to burn the bridge suggests that ending the relationship was necessary, but the manner in which John expressed it was toxic.\n\nAdditionally, Carol's ex mentioned she's had this pattern before, indicating a possible pattern of manipulative behavior. However, John's responsibility is to take her threats seriously, not dismiss or encourage them. Even if he felt cornered, his response was unacceptable. There's no justification for saying something that could push someone to actually follow through on a suicide threat.\n\nIn conclusion, while Carol's actions are troubling, John's response was inappropriate and harmful. He should have prioritized her safety over his frustration. So, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
