I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The ex, Carol, has a history of threatening suicide to win arguments. The author initially tried to stop arguing when she said that, but over time she used it more often. The breaking point came when she compared it to his mom's suicide, leading him to yell at her to go through with it and leave. Now he's staying with his dad, ignoring her calls, and his dad is helping him move out. Carol is upset and spreading that he left because he doesn't love her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. Carol's behavior of threatening suicide to end arguments is a red flag. People using self-harm as a manipulation tool is dangerous and not acceptable. However, the author's response was to encourage her to follow through with the threat. Even if he's frustrated, telling someone to kill themselves is obviously wrong. That's a serious issue.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions he has a history of depression and family suicide, so maybe there's some context. However, that doesn't excuse his response. His actions could have led to real harm. Even if Carol was manipulating him, the right thing to do is to not encourage her to act on those threats. He should have sought help, maybe involved professionals, instead of responding in a way that could lead to her actually attempting suicide.\n\nAlso, moving out and cutting contact might be necessary for his own well-being if the relationship is toxic, but the way he handled the confrontation was harmful. His dad's advice to burn the bridge might be valid, but the author's words were cruel and could have dire consequences. \n\nThe fact that Carol has a pattern of this behavior from previous relationships is important. The author knew she had a history but still didn't take the right steps when things escalated. Instead of supporting her or getting help, he gave a harmful response. \n\nSo, even though there's context about their struggles and the arguments, the author's direct encouragement for her to commit suicide is unequivocally wrong. That's a clear act of being in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
