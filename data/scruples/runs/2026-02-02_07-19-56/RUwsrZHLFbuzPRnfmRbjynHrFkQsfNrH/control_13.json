I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an ex who threatened suicide multiple times during arguments, and the author eventually told her to go through with it. The key points here are the history of suicidal threats as a manipulative tactic, the author's response, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that Carol has a history of threatening suicide, even with a previous partner. The author tried to stop arguments each time she made these threats initially but eventually snapped. The final straw was when she made a reference to the author's own mother's suicide, leading him to yell at her to just do it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's response was to tell her to go through with it, which is clearly harmful. Even if the author was stressed and frustrated, responding in a way that encourages or dismisses suicidal thoughts is dangerous. People in crisis need support, not threats or dismissive comments. The fact that Carol used this as a manipulative tactic doesn't justify the author's response. However, it's important to note that the author was dealing with a very difficult and possibly abusive situation.\n\nBut regardless of the context, telling someone to commit suicide is not acceptable. It's a serious violation and can have severe consequences. The author's actions contributed to the breakdown of the relationship and likely caused Carol emotional harm. Even if Carol's behavior was manipulative, the author should have sought help or left the situation in a healthier way instead of making a harmful comment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's response was inappropriate and harmful. They are in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation responsibly. They should have encouraged professional help or distanced themselves without making derogatory or dangerous remarks. Therefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
