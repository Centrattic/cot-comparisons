I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their ex, Carol, to go through with her suicide threat during an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that Carol had a history of threatening suicide to end arguments, which started when they were together. She also had a previous ex who ended the relationship due to similar behavior. The author has been stressed because Carol moved in with them, isn't working, and the situation escalated. The final straw was when Carol made a suicide threat referencing the author's mother's suicide, leading the author to yell at her to \"just do it\" and leave.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's response to Carol's suicide threats. Suicide is a serious matter, and responding with encouragement or even passive-aggressive remarks is problematic. The author's statement \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch\" is clearly harmful. Even if the author was emotionally overwhelmed, responding in this way could be seen as callous and could potentially contribute to harm. The fact that Carol has a history of this behavior doesn't justify the author's response; in fact, it might indicate that the author should have been more cautious and supportive, or perhaps sought professional help earlier.\n\nAdditionally, the author's decision to leave suddenly and ignore Carol's calls might be seen as cutting her off, which could be dangerous if she's truly in a suicidal mindset. The author's dad's reaction to \"burn the bridge now\" suggests that they might be supporting an abrupt end, but it's unclear if other support systems were in place for Carol.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is clearly distressed and mentions their own mental health struggles, including witnessing their mother's suicide. They might feel trapped and overwhelmed, but that doesn't excuse the harmful response. The author's actions could be seen as a breakdown under stress rather than a calculated decision.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, encouraging someone to take their life, even in anger, is a red line. It's important to prioritize the safety of others, especially in situations where they've made threats. The author's response might be seen as enabling the threat rather than addressing it constructively. They should have de-escalated the situation, perhaps by removing themselves from the environment and ensuring Carol had access to help, rather than making a derogatory comment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). Even if the situation is complex, the direct encouragement (or sarcastic encouragement) of suicide is unacceptable. The author needs to take responsibility for their words and consider the potential consequences of their actions. They might also need to reflect on how to handle such situations better in the future, possibly by seeking professional help for both themselves and Carol.\n"
