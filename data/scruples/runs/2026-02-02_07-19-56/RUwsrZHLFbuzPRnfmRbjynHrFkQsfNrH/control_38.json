I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. So, the author is an ex-boyfriend of Carol. Carol had a history of suicidal threats during arguments. The author's mom died by suicide when he was 12, and Carol also has a family history of suicide. \n\nThe main issue is that during their relationship, Carol would use suicide threats to end arguments. The author initially tried to de-escalate, but over time, as the threats became more frequent and for trivial reasons, he got more frustrated. The final straw was when Carol brought up the author's mom's suicide, leading him to yell at her to \"just do it\" and leave. Now, he's staying with his dad, and Carol is upset, claiming he doesn't love her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, using suicide threats to manipulate or end arguments is a red flag. Anytime someone threatens suicide to win an argument, that's a serious issue and can be a sign of underlying mental health problems. The fact that Carol's ex mentioned she had done this before with a previous partner suggests a pattern of behavior that's not healthy.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to tell her to go through with it, which is obviously harmful. Even if he was frustrated, responding with a cruel message that effectively encourages her to commit suicide is not okay. It's a violation of empathy and support, especially since both have histories of suicide in their families. The author's words could be seen as dismissive of her real pain, even if she was using it inappropriately.\n\nBut then again, the author was dealing with stress and emotional exhaustion. The fact that he left the relationship and is now distancing himself could be seen as a necessary step for his own well-being. However, the manner in which he ended it\u2014by making a hurtful comment\u2014could exacerbate Carol's mental health issues. Even if he's trying to protect himself, his response might have been a harmful way to handle it.\n\nAlso, the author's father's reaction to \"burn the bridge now\" suggests that cutting off contact completely might be advised, but the author's specific words were harsh. The line between being frustrated and being harmful is thin here. The key point is that even if Carol was manipulating him, the author shouldn't have responded with a statement that could push her further into despair.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with compassion. Instead of confronting her about her behavior or seeking professional help, he lashed out, which could have serious consequences. Even if his intention was to end the toxic dynamic, his method was inappropriate and potentially dangerous. \n\nOn the other hand, Carol's behavior was manipulative and unhealthy, but that doesn't excuse the author's response. The right approach would have been to distance himself calmly and encourage her to seek professional help, rather than making a threatening comment. Therefore, the author's actions were wrong, so the answer should be A.\n"
