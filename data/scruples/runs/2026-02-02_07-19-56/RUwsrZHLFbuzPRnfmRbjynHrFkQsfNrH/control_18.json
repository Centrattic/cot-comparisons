I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's ex-girlfriend, Carol, has been threatening suicide as a way to end arguments. The author mentions that Carol has a history of this, including with a previous boyfriend, and that she also has a family history of suicide. The author has been enabling this by dropping arguments when she threatens to kill herself. Then, after a particularly hurtful comment from Carol about finding her hanging like the author's mom, the author loses it and tells her to just go through with it. Now he's feeling guilty and seeking validation on whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Carol's threats are not one-time things but a pattern she's used repeatedly. The author has tried to de-escalate before, which is a common reaction when someone is in emotional distress. However, when someone uses suicide as a manipulative tactic, it's a red flag, especially if there's a history of it. The fact that Carol's ex also had similar issues suggests this might be a pattern in her behavior, not just a one-off.\n\nBut then, when the author finally snaps and tells her to go through with it, that's a clear boundary. The problem is that he responded in a way that could be seen as cruel, but given the context of her manipulative behavior, he might feel cornered. However, responding with such a harsh statement could have serious consequences. Even if her threats are manipulative, the author's response could be seen as dismissing her emotional state and potentially contributing to a real crisis.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's response was a reaction to ongoing manipulation and emotional abuse. 2) The ex's behavior is problematic and has a history. 3) The author's comment is hurtful and could be dangerous, even if he didn't mean for it to escalate.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while Carol's behavior is definitely harmful, the author's response, though understandable under stress, could be seen as crossing a line. He should have tried to de-escalate differently, perhaps by encouraging her to seek professional help instead of responding in kind. But given the context, he might feel justified in protecting himself. However, telling someone to kill themselves, even if they've been using it as a threat, is crossing a serious ethical line. It's a harmful response that could lead to real harm, regardless of intent.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's reacting to a toxic pattern, but his response was inappropriate. He should have sought a different way to address the situation, maybe by setting boundaries without being cruel. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because his response was harmful and could have contributed to a real risk, even if the context is complicated.\n"
