I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about the author's ex-girlfriend, Carol, who has a history of suicidal threats during arguments. The author has been responding to these threats by dropping the argument, but over time, Carol's behavior escalated. In the final incident, after a particularly hurtful comment from Carol, the author told her to go through with it, leading to them breaking up and the author moving out. The user wants to know if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Carol has a history of using suicide as a manipulation tactic. She's threatened suicide multiple times, even before this relationship. The author has been enabling this by backing down each time. The final straw was when Carol made a direct reference to the author's mother's suicide, which triggered the author's outburst. The author then told her to go ahead and do it, which is a major issue because encouraging someone to commit suicide is illegal and morally wrong in many places.\n\nHowever, the author's response is in the context of being emotionally overwhelmed and possibly reacting to years of manipulation. The author's ex's behavior is clearly problematic and harmful, but the author's response\u2014encouraging her to follow through on a suicide threat\u2014is not appropriate. Even if the author is stressed, the act of telling someone to commit suicide is not justifiable. The author's actions could be seen as negligent or even complicit, especially if Carol does act on it. The fact that the author's own mother died by suicide adds a layer of trauma, but that doesn't excuse the response.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they were at their breaking point and couldn't handle the situation anymore. But the correct approach would have been to seek help, maybe encourage Carol to get professional help, or remove themselves from the situation without encouraging harmful behavior. The author's outburst, while understandable in terms of emotional distress, is still a serious mistake.\n\nSo, even though Carol's behavior is inexcusable, the author's response of telling her to go through with it is inappropriate and dangerous. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation responsibly and instead of providing support or seeking help, they encouraged her to follow through on a suicide threat.\n"
