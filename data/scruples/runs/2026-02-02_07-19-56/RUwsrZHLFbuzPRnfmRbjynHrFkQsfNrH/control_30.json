I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is in a relationship with Carol, who has a history of threatening suicide to win arguments. He mentions they both have depression and family histories of suicide. Carol quit her job and moved in with him, but hasn't looked for a new one, leading to arguments. She uses suicide threats in these arguments, and when he doesn't back down, she says he doesn't love her and wants her to die. The final straw was when she compared his experience to his mother's death by suicide, which made him yell at her to just do it, saying it would make his life easier. He then left and hasn't returned, with his dad helping to move stuff out.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. Carol is using suicide threats as a means to end arguments, which is a serious issue. Threatening suicide to manipulate someone is not acceptable, but it's a red flag for deeper problems, possibly including mental health struggles. The author has a history of depression and a traumatic experience with his mother's suicide, which complicates his reaction.\n\nThen there's the author's response. When Carol made the suicide threat, he responded with \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier, Just know I won't be here to find you.\" This is clearly a harsh and callous response. Even if he was frustrated, such a reaction could be seen as encouraging or dismissing her emotional distress, which is dangerous. People in crisis can take words like that seriously, especially if they're already vulnerable.\n\nThe fact that Carol is claiming he left because he doesn't love her on Facebook adds another layer. It's possible she's in a heightened emotional state, but the author's decision to leave and not respond to her calls might be seen as abandoning her. However, he felt he had reached a breaking point and was prioritizing his own well-being. But when someone is in a crisis, the other person's responsibility to ensure their safety is important, even if the relationship is toxic.\n\nMental health is a big factor here. Carol's suicide threats might be a symptom of her depression and past trauma. The author should have recognized the seriousness of her statements, even if they were used as a manipulative tactic. Responding with anger and telling her to go through with it could have contributed to a dangerous situation. He might have needed to de-escalate the situation, maybe by not engaging in the argument and instead seeking professional help for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also dealing with his own stress and emotional burden. Carol's behavior might have been emotionally abusive, and his breaking point is understandable. However, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and encouraging her to commit suicide\u2014is problematic. Even if the relationship was difficult, his response could be seen as cruel and potentially contributing to her suicidal thoughts.\n\nI should also consider the advice from his dad to \"burn the bridge now,\" which might imply that ending the relationship is necessary for his well-being. But the immediate reaction of walking out without ensuring she's safe is questionable. He might have been in the right to end the relationship if her behavior was harmful, but the method and words he used made it worse.\n\nIn summary, while Carol's use of suicide threats is inexcusable and a sign of deeper issues, the author's response was not appropriate. Telling someone to go through with a suicide threat is a serious mistake, regardless of the situation. He should have taken steps to ensure she's safe, maybe by contacting a professional or not engaging in the argument. His actions might have put her at risk and could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state, even if the relationship was causing him stress. So, the author is in the wrong (A) because his reaction was harmful and could have exacerbated the situation.\n"
