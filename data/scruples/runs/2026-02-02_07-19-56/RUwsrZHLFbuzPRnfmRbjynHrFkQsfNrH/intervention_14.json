I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author responding to their ex's repeated suicide threats by telling her to go through with it, which led to them leaving the relationship. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author's ex, Carol, has a history of suicidal ideation, including threats during arguments. The author mentions that Carol has been using these threats to end disagreements, even for minor issues. Over time, the author became increasingly stressed and, in a moment of breaking point, told Carol to actually commit suicide, leading to them leaving. The key points here are the repeated threats, the author's emotional state, and the specific response given.\n\nSuicidal threats, even if not immediately acted upon, are serious. They indicate significant distress and potential mental health issues. The author's response\u2014encouraging Carol to follow through on her threat\u2014is problematic. While the author might have been under a lot of stress, responding with such a direct encouragement can be harmful. It's important to note that in most cases, people in crisis need support, not dismissal or encouragement to act on harmful impulses.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions that Carol's behavior was persistent and manipulative, possibly in a pattern that's affected their well-being. The author's decision to leave the relationship might be seen as a self-preservation step, but the manner in which they expressed it is definitely an issue. Telling someone to \"just do it\" is not only cruel but can also contribute to a dangerous situation. \n\nThere's a balance between acknowledging the seriousness of someone's threats and not enabling destructive behavior. The author's reaction, while perhaps a culmination of stress, is not a healthy or constructive response. It's possible that the author felt cornered or overwhelmed, but the response crossed a line.\n\nAlso, considering the aftermath\u2014Carol's Facebook rant and the author's father's reaction\u2014it's clear that the situation escalated significantly. The author's words could be interpreted as a trigger, even if that wasn't the intention. The responsibility here lies with the person making threats, but the responder also has a duty to not encourage such actions.\n\nIn mental health terms, when someone is in crisis, the appropriate response is to seek professional help, ensure their safety, and offer support. The author's response failed on all counts. Even if the author felt justified in their frustration, the way they expressed it was harmful and inconsiderate of Carol's mental state.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the situation is complicated and both parties may have contributed to the breakdown of the relationship, the author's specific response of encouraging a suicide attempt is clearly in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
