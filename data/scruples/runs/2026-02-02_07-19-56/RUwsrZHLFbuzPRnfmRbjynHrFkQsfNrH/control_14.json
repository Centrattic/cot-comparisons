I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the mentioned situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-girlfriend named Carol who has a history of suicidal threats and mental health issues. The author, who has his own traumatic background with suicide in the family, has been dealing with Carol's manipulative behavior during their arguments.\n\nFirst, the author's response to Carol's suicide threat was to tell her to \"just do it,\" which he later regrets. That's a strong and harsh reaction. Even though he might have been under a lot of stress and frustration, encouraging someone to commit suicide is a serious matter. It's not just about the words themselves but the potential impact they can have, especially on someone with a history of mental health issues. \n\nCarol has been using these threats as a manipulation tactic during arguments, which is problematic. However, the author's response was to verbally attack her and wish for her death. That's crossing a line, regardless of the provocation. The fact that he followed through by leaving and not contacting her, leading to her calling him over 100 times, suggests that his actions caused her significant distress. \n\nAdditionally, the author's father is taking action to remove all ties, which might indicate that the author's behavior was seen as extreme and harmful. The author's own feelings of emptiness and regret after the incident also point to the severity of his reaction. \n\nWhile Carol's behavior is inexcusable and she has a history of manipulation, the author's response was not only hurtful but could be seen as enabling her destructive behavior. By telling her to \"just do it,\" he might have inadvertently validated her threats or given her a sense of power, which could be dangerous. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have issues, but the author's reaction was a direct provocation that went beyond healthy conflict resolution. Encouraging suicide, even in anger, is a serious ethical and moral failing. Therefore, the author is at fault here.\n"
