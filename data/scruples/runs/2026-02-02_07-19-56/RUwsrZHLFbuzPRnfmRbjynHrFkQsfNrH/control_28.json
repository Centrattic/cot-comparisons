I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is a complicated one involving a breakup and threats of suicide.\n\nFirst, the author's ex, Carol, has a history of suicide threats. She moved in with the author and hasn't been looking for a new job, leading to arguments. She uses suicide as a way to end arguments, which the author found increasingly frustrating. The final straw was when she compared the situation to the author finding her hanging, like he found his mom. The author then told her to \"just do it\" and left. \n\nNow, the author is being asked if they're in the wrong. On one hand, responding to suicide threats with such a harsh comment is definitely harmful. Even if the author was stressed, saying \"just do it\" could be seen as cruel and dismissive of her mental health. It's important to take threats seriously and encourage help rather than dismiss them.\n\nBut the author also mentions their own background with a family member's suicide. This might add some context to their emotional state. However, that doesn't excuse the hurtful response. The key here is that responding to someone's suicide threats with any kind of encouragement, even indirect, is problematic. The author's reaction could be seen as a breaking point, but the way they expressed it was harmful.\n\nAdditionally, the ex's previous history with suicide threats and the current behavior suggests a pattern of using threats to manipulate. The author might have felt cornered, but reacting with such a statement is not acceptable. The correct approach would be to seek professional help, not to dismiss or encourage such actions.\n\nSo, even though the author might have been under a lot of stress and had reasons for frustration, their response was inappropriate. They should have de-escalated the situation or sought help rather than making a hurtful comment. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
