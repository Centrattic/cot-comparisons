I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The author, let's call him John, is talking about his ex-girlfriend, Carol. They've been dealing with a lot of issues, especially around her threatening suicide during arguments. John's response was to tell her to go through with it, which obviously escalated things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Carol has a history of suicidal threats, both from past relationships and her own family. John mentions that when she first started threatening suicide, he'd drop arguments, but as it became more frequent, he stopped responding. However, when she used a direct reference to his mom's suicide, John snapped and told her to just do it, which led to him leaving and cutting contact.\n\nNow, the key question is whether John's response was wrong. On one hand, threatening someone to commit suicide is clearly harmful and inappropriate. Even if John was frustrated, saying \"just do it\" could be seen as enabling her suicidal behavior or being dismissive of her mental health. It's a dangerous thing to say, regardless of the context. \n\nOn the other hand, John is under a lot of stress. Carol's behavior has been manipulative, using suicide as a tactic in arguments. He's also dealing with his own trauma from his mother's suicide. His reaction might stem from being overwhelmed and feeling that he can't handle the situation anymore. However, his response was to escalate the conflict rather than seek help, which might be part of the problem.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if someone is being manipulative, responding with a threat of suicide is not something to be taken lightly. John's statement could be interpreted as encouraging or not taking her threats seriously, which is dangerous. There's also the aspect of his own mental health; he's stressed and on the verge of tears, which might cloud his judgment. However, that doesn't excuse his words.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Carol has a history of this behavior from previous relationships suggests that John might have known or should have known that her threats were not just for attention but part of a deeper mental health issue. His response of telling her to go ahead could be seen as neglecting his responsibility to support her or at least not provoke her further.\n\nIn terms of accountability, even if Carol's actions were problematic, John's response was unkind and potentially harmful. It's important to address such situations with care and seek professional help, not escalate with threats. So, despite the context, John's words were inappropriate and inconsiderate of Carol's mental state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A\u2014John is in the wrong.\n"
