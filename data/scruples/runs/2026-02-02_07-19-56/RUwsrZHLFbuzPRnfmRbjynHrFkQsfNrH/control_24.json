I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with Carol, and they both have a history of depression and family suicides. Carol has been using suicide threats during arguments, which the author initially tried to de-escalate but eventually lashed out at her, telling her to go through with it. The author left the apartment and is now staying with his dad, and Carol is upset, claiming he doesn't love her.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of Carol's behavior. She has a history of suicide threats, even with her ex, and the author is aware of her mental health struggles. The author mentions that Carol's threats are becoming more frequent and trivial, which is causing him stress. However, responding with \"just do it\" is a serious reaction. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, suicide threats, even if manipulative, should never be dismissed or encouraged. The author's response of telling her to go through with it, even if in anger, is harmful. It's important to note that the author's own trauma (finding his mom's body) might be contributing to his emotional state, but that doesn't excuse his response.\n\nThe author's father's reaction and the situation leading to the breakup also play a role. The author's decision to leave might be seen as self-preservation, but the way he responded to the threat is problematic. Even if the user is frustrated, the appropriate action would be to encourage professional help for Carol and maybe take a break from the relationship if it's toxic, rather than inciting her to actually commit suicide.\n\nHowever, the author's mental state is also a factor. He's been stressed and overwhelmed, which might explain his outburst, but it doesn't justify his words. The key point here is that responding to a suicide threat with encouragement, even sarcastically, is never acceptable. The author needs to take responsibility for his part in the argument, regardless of Carol's behavior.\n\nIn summary, while the author might be dealing with a toxic situation, his reaction was inappropriate and could be seen as dismissive of Carol's mental health. He should have addressed the issue differently, perhaps by setting boundaries without encouraging self-harm. Therefore, he is at least partially in the wrong.\n"
