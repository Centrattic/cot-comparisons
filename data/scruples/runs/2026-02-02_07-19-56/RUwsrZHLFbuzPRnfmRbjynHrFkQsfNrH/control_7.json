I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The key points are that the author's ex, Carol, threatened to kill herself multiple times during arguments. The author initially responded by stopping the argument, but over time, Carol kept using this tactic more frequently. The final incident led the author to tell her to go through with it, which resulted in them leaving the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Threatening suicide is a serious matter, and responding with a cruel comment like telling someone to actually do it seems harmful. Even if the author was stressed, their response could be seen as dismissive and potentially dangerous. The fact that Carol has a history of this behavior with previous partners adds weight to the idea that the author might not have been aware of the severity of the situation. However, the author's own trauma (finding their mom like that) might influence their reaction, but that doesn't excuse the harmful words.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was clearly overwhelmed and in a lot of emotional pain. They felt that Carol wasn't contributing and that the threats were manipulative. The ex-boyfriend's account suggests this is a pattern, so the author might have been in a toxic situation. However, the way the author responded could have contributed to the situation getting worse. Yelling and saying hurtful things, even in anger, can be damaging.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a psychological standpoint, using suicide threats as a manipulation tactic is a red flag, but it's important to take those threats seriously. The author's response, while emotionally charged, could be seen as crossing a line. However, the context of the relationship's breakdown and the author's own mental health struggles add complexity. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their response was to encourage the action Carol was threatening, which is harmful. Even if they were in pain, the appropriate response would be to seek help or not engage, rather than provoking further harm. The fact that Carol has a history of this behavior means the author should have known to take it seriously and not respond in a way that could make her feel validated in her threats.\n"
