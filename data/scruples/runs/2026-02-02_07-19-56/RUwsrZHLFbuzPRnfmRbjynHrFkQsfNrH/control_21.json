I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo the author is in a relationship with Carol, who has a history of threatening suicide, especially when they argue. The author mentions that Carol has a family history of suicide and that they both deal with depression. Carol moved in with the author, hasn't been looking for a new job, and they've been arguing a lot. She uses suicide threats to end arguments, which the author has started to take more seriously. The breaking point was when Carol made a comment about the author finding her hanging like his mom, leading the author to yell at her to go through with it and then leave. Now he's staying with his dad, she's ranting on Facebook, and he's feeling like he messed up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions were wrong. When someone is making suicide threats, especially someone with a history of it, the appropriate response is usually to take it seriously, seek professional help, and not engage in ways that could escalate the situation. The author, instead of getting her help, told her to go through with it, which is extremely dangerous. Even if he was frustrated, his response could have put her life at risk. That seems like a clear wrong action.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with a lot of stress from their relationship dynamics and Carol's behavior. He might be overwhelmed, but that doesn't excuse his response. The key point here is that when someone is threatening self-harm, the right approach is to encourage them to get help, not to enable or provoke them. The author's comment could be seen as a failure to act responsibly in a crisis situation.\n\nAdditionally, Carol's behavior is concerning, but the author has a responsibility to handle it in a way that prioritizes her safety. Even if her threats were manipulative, the correct response is to seek support from professionals or authorities, not to respond with hostility or dismissiveness. The fact that her ex also mentioned similar issues suggests that this pattern has been ongoing, which means the author should have been aware of the risks.\n\nThe author's reaction, while understandable given the stress, is not appropriate. He should have de-escalated the situation, insisted she get help, or contacted someone like a mental health professional or a crisis hotline. Yelling and encouraging her to follow through with her threat is a serious misstep. Even if the relationship is ending, the priority in such moments should be safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for his response. His actions could have led to a tragic outcome, and there's no justification for dismissing or encouraging a suicide threat, regardless of the circumstances.\n"
