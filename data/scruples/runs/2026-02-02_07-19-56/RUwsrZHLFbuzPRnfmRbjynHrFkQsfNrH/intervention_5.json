I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a former partner of Carol, who threatened to kill herself during arguments. The author responded by telling Carol to go through with it if she was going to do it, and then left. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want my input.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. Carol has a history of suicidal threats. The author mentions that she used these threats to win arguments, and over time, it became more frequent for minor issues. The author tried to de-escalate initially, but eventually, in a heated argument, he told her to go ahead and do it. This led to him leaving the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here, threatening suicide is a serious matter, especially if someone has a history of it. However, the author's response of encouraging her to follow through is problematic. Even if the person is using it manipulatively, responding with such a statement could be seen as callous and could potentially escalate the situation. The author's emotional response is understandable given the stress, but the way he handled it is questionable.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. Carol's repeated use of suicidal threats as a manipulation tactic.\n2. The author's history of not responding to these threats before, but the final breaking point leading to a harsh response.\n3. The author's action of telling her to \"just do it\" which is clearly harmful, regardless of the context.\n\nEven if the author felt overwhelmed and was trying to protect himself, responding in a way that dismisses her threats could be dangerous. It's possible that Carol genuinely has underlying mental health issues, and the author's response might have contributed to her distress. However, the author also faced significant stress and perhaps felt trapped. The question is whether his actions crossed a line.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's statement was direct and cruel. While he later left the relationship, the immediate reaction is the focus here. The fact that his father advised him to \"burn the bridge\" might indicate societal judgment against the author's actions. Also, the aftermath with Carol's Facebook rants and the author's feelings of guilt suggest that the situation is complex, but the act of telling someone to commit suicide, regardless of intent, is morally wrong. \n\nTherefore, even if there's context of ongoing manipulation, the author's response was inappropriate and harmful. He is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation in a constructive or supportive way, especially given her history. So the answer should be A.\n"
