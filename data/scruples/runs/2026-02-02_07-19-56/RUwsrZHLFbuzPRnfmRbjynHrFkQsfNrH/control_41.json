I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that Carol, his ex, has been threatening suicide during arguments. He's been responding by backing down at first, but over time, she's used it more often. Then in a recent argument, she made a specific threat referencing his mom's suicide, and he responded angrily, telling her to go through with it and left. Now he's feeling guilty and wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Carol has a history of suicidal threats, even with a previous partner. She's not working, moving in with him, and expecting him to support her. Their arguments are escalating, and she's using suicide as a manipulative tactic. The author is clearly stressed and overwhelmed. But when she made that specific threat about hanging like his mom, he snapped and told her to do it, which is extremely harsh. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether his response is in the wrong. Even if someone is manipulative, responding with a callous wish for their death is never okay. Encouraging someone to commit suicide, even if it's in anger, is a serious issue. The author didn't take any immediate action to ensure her safety, like contacting a mental health professional or emergency services. Instead, he left the situation entirely. That's a problem because when someone is in a crisis, especially with suicide mentioned, there's a responsibility to intervene or seek help. \n\nAlso, the author's history of depression and family suicide might make him more sensitive, but that doesn't excuse his response. The fact that he's been ignoring her calls and his dad is moving everything out shows that the situation is deteriorating, but it's unclear if any professional help was sought during the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is under a lot of stress from Carol's behavior, which is manipulative and harmful. He might feel trapped and overwhelmed. However, the line is crossed when he tells her to go ahead and kill herself. That's a direct encouragement of suicide, which is morally and ethically wrong, regardless of the circumstances. Even if she was manipulative, the correct response would be to take her seriously, ensure her safety, and perhaps seek professional help rather than responding with such a damaging statement.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he encouraged suicide, which is a serious offense, and didn't take appropriate steps to address her mental health crisis instead of reacting with anger.\n"
