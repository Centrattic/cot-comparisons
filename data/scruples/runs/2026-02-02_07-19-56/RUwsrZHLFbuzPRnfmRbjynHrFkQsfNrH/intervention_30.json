I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their ex-girlfriend, Carol, who has a history of depression and family suicides. She threatened to kill herself during arguments, and the author finally snaps and tells her to go through with it, leading to them breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Carol has a history of suicidal threats and has done this in past relationships, according to her previous boyfriend. The author has been trying to de-escalate by dropping arguments when she threatens suicide, but it's happening more frequently. The final argument leads to the author yelling at her to go through with it and leaving.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's response to Carol's suicide threats. Threats of self-harm are serious, and responding with encouragement or even passive-aggressive statements can be dangerous. Even if the author is stressed and frustrated, directly telling someone to carry out a suicide threat is crossing a line. It's not about whether the author is right to be frustrated but about the appropriate response to someone's suicidal ideation.\n\nHowever, there's also the context that Carol has a history of using these threats manipulatively. But even so, as a partner, the expectation is to respond in a way that supports their well-being. The author's reaction, while possibly a culmination of stress, is not a constructive or supportive response. It's a harmful statement that could potentially contribute to a crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel overwhelmed and have reached their breaking point. The fact that Carol isn't contributing financially and has other issues might add to the stress. But the way the author handled it\u2014by encouraging her to commit suicide\u2014is not acceptable. The appropriate action would be to seek professional help for Carol, involve authorities if necessary, or distance oneself in a way that doesn't involve harmful speech.\n\nSo, in the end, even though there's context about Carol's behavior, the author's direct encouragement of her suicide threat is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
