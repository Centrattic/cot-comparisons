I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an ex who made suicide threats during arguments. The author, after a heated argument, told her to go through with it and left. Now, the ex is upset, and the author is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both the author and Carol have a history of depression and family suicide. Carol moved in with the author and hasn't been looking for a job, causing frustration. She uses suicide threats to end arguments, and the author finally snaps, telling her to do it. \n\nThe key issue here is the author's response to the suicide threat. Even if Carol's threats are part of a pattern, the author's reaction of encouraging her to follow through is definitely a problem. It's not the first time she's done this, but that doesn't justify a harmful response. People in crisis, especially with a history of mental health issues, can be influenced by such statements. The author's words could be seen as callous and potentially harmful, even if they were angry. \n\nAlso, the fact that Carol's ex reached out to the author about similar behavior suggests a pattern. The author might have known this was a recurring issue but didn't address it properly. Instead of confronting the underlying problems or seeking help, the author lashed out. \n\nThe author left the apartment and is now ignoring over 100 calls. That could be a form of emotional abuse or abandonment. Carol is using Facebook to spread her side, but the author's response of hoping she would kill herself is a major red flag. \n\nEven if the author was stressed and frustrated, responding with a threat of that nature is not acceptable. The right approach would be to de-escalate the situation, maybe by stepping away and encouraging her to seek professional help. The author's reaction might have been a result of their own past trauma (seeing their mom's body), but that doesn't excuse the harmful comment. \n\nThe dad's reaction to \"burn the bridge\" and move out suggests he thinks ending the relationship is necessary for the author's well-being. However, the author's initial statement in the question admits they might be an asshole, which is a good indicator they know they did something wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's words were a direct encouragement to harm someone, which is a serious issue regardless of context. So the answer is A.\n"
