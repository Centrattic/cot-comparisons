I might as well give some context though.\n\nSo, a little back story. I met my (now-ex) girlfriend (we'll call her Carol) 3 years ago through a mutual friend. We hit it off almost immediately. We both had the same interests and lived close enough that we started doing things together. As things got more serious between us, it became clear we both deal with depression and had a family history involving them. When I was 12, i walked in on my mom's hanging body and Carol had multiple members of her family who had committed suicide. We were able to somewhat bond over these issues and began to share and confide issues with each other.\n\nRecently, though, me and Carol have had some issues. I don't know how relevant they are but Carol quit her job and moved into my apartment in June last year. She said she did this to find a place that gave her less hours but to my knowledge she has not looked for a new job and has no plans to. This has frustrated me to no end as it seems she expects me to support her for the foreseeable future with no plans of her own to help out. \n\nBecause of this, we have been arguing more and more. And ever since this has started, she always says \"Well, maybe i'll just kill myself\" to end an argument. At first when she did this, I stopped arguing with her and either dropped the issue or let her vent to me. As time went on though, she's been using this more and more for simpler and simpler issues. And when I don't drop whatever subject we were arguing about immediately when she says this, she storms off and claims I \"don't love her and want her to kill herself.\"\n\nThis whole issue has been eating me up more and more with each day. So much so that I honestly don't even talk to her much anymore. Along with this, an ex-boyfriend of her's reached out to me on facebook last week to talk to me. According to him this is not the first time she's done this. Their relationship ended when she began to threaten to kill herself when she would not get her way.\n\nWith everything that's been going on, i've been super stressed and honestly on the verge of tears most days. This Sunday was the final straw. Carol asked me for something, I said no and an argument broke out. As normal, she brought up a threat of suicide. This time, though, she said that she \"hopes I find her hanging like I found my mom\". This broke me down and I yelled at her \"If you're going to do it just do it you bitch. Honestly, I hope you do. Will make my life a hell of a lot easier,  Just know I won't be here to find you\". As I said that I loaded a backpack with everything I wanted and stormed out with her begging me not to go and apologizing. I drove 3 hours that night and have been staying with my dad since. She's called me over a 100 times and I;ve ignored each one. When I told my dad what happened he became livid and told me to \"burn the bridge now\". \n\nI feel like a mess right now. I loved her and right now I just feel empty toward everything. My dad is planning on driving the 3 hours tomorrow and moving everything out of the apartment and is telling me to find a new place away from her. Carol has also been going on a facebook rant since then and telling everyone I stormed out because i didn't love her. \n\nI don't know anymore. I just feel like I messed up horribly and what I did was unforgivable. Am I a major asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author shared their story where their ex threatened to kill herself during arguments, and eventually, the author responded by telling her to go through with it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the ex's history of suicidal threats and the author's response. The author mentions that the ex has a family history of suicide and her own struggles with depression. She's been using suicide threats as a way to end arguments, which the author initially tried to accommodate but eventually snapped.\n\nThe critical moment is when the author, after a final argument, tells the ex to go ahead and kill herself, which is a direct and harmful response. Even if the author was upset and feeling overwhelmed, encouraging or dismissing someone's suicidal threats can be extremely damaging. It's important to consider the intent here. The author's words were not intended to help but to end the argument and their own emotional pain. However, such a response could push someone with mental health issues further into crisis.\n\nThe author's actions afterward, like moving out and ignoring calls, might be seen as a form of emotional withdrawal. While the ex's behavior was manipulative, the author's reaction was also extreme. The ex's threats are part of a pattern, which the author was aware of, but instead of seeking help or setting healthy boundaries, the author chose to respond in a way that's harmful.\n\nMental health is a big factor here. The ex's history suggests she might need professional help, not just someone to give in to her threats. The author, instead of encouraging her to seek support, gave in to the manipulation, which is not healthy. However, the final response of telling her to kill herself is clearly wrong, regardless of the circumstances. It's a form of emotional abuse and could have real consequences. The author should have left the situation but in a way that didn't invalidate or encourage the threats.\n\nThe answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because directly telling someone to go through with a suicide threat is never acceptable. Even in the context of a difficult relationship, that response is harmful and crosses a line. The author's frustration and stress don't excuse the words used. They should have prioritized the ex's safety and their own, perhaps by seeking counseling or ending the relationship more constructively. The fact that the ex had a history of this behavior and the author knew about it doesn't justify the response. So, the author is in the wrong for their reaction and how they handled the situation.\n"
