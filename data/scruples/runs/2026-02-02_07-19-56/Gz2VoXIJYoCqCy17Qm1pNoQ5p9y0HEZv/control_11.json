I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing her cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 15, female, and her cousins visit. The male cousin stays in her bed, and she sleeps on the couch. She catches him masturbating twice. She doesn't mind the act itself but is upset because it's in her bed, which she has to wash. The cousin responds disrespectfully, and she's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nNow, the key points here. The cousin is doing something private in a shared space. The author's bed is her personal space, even if he's staying there. She has a valid concern about hygiene and the responsibility of washing the sheets. She's not forbidding the act, just the location. The cousin's response is disrespectful, which adds to the problem.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's expressing her boundaries. It's reasonable to ask someone not to do something in your space. The cousin's behavior is the issue here, not the author's reaction. She's not being judgmental about the act itself but about where it's done. So, she's standing up for her own space and responsibility. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that the cousin's privacy is important. However, the act is happening in her bed, which she's responsible for. The cousin isn't respecting her boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong. She's handling it by setting boundaries and considering informing the parents, which is reasonable if the cousin isn't listening.\n"
