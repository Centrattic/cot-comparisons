I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl who's dealing with her 15-year-old male cousin. The situation is that when her cousins visit, her male cousin uses her bed and she sleeps on the couch. She caught him masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, especially since she'll have to wash the sheets. The cousin responded disrespectfully, saying she's being a bitch and that it's his body. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle but wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if she's in the wrong. The initial thought is that she might be, but I need to analyze carefully. Let's look at the facts. The cousin was in her room using her bed, which is her personal space. She didn't knock and found him self-stimulating. She asked him not to do it in her bed, but he continued. She's concerned about the sheets and the hygiene aspect. The cousin is being disrespectful in his response.\n\nNow, considering privacy and personal space. The cousin is in her room, which she may have the right to, since they're staying at the house. But when she enters without knocking, she's invading his privacy. However, she's the one who owns the room and the bed. So there's a conflict between privacy and personal space. \n\nMasturbation is a personal and private act. It's not illegal, but in a shared space, boundaries need to be respected. The cousin was in her room using her bed, so she might have a right to ask for privacy in her own room. However, when she entered without knocking, she might have intruded on his privacy. But since it's her room, she might not need to knock. This is a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe user's main issue is not the act itself but the location. She's okay with him doing it in general but not in her bed. She's also concerned about the sheets. The cousin is being disrespectful in his response, which is a valid concern. The user is trying to set a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the way she's handling it might be confrontational, especially if she's going to tell her aunt and uncle. \n\nIs she in the wrong for wanting her bed to be private? Maybe not. But she did enter without knocking, which is a key point. Entering someone's room without permission can be seen as a privacy violation. However, since it's her room, perhaps she has the right to enter. The cousin is a guest in the house but is using her bed without her consent each time. \n\nSo, there's a mutual issue here. The cousin isn't respecting her space by not locking the door, and she's entering without knocking. But the user is trying to set boundaries, which is valid. The fact that she's washing the sheets is a practical concern, not just about the act itself. The cousin's response is disrespectful, which the user is justified in being upset about. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's a complex situation. She might not be entirely in the wrong because she's asserting her space, but her approach could be more considerate. However, entering without knocking might be a mistake. If she had knocked and waited, maybe the situation wouldn't have occurred. But since it's her room, maybe she's allowed to enter. \n\nConsidering all that, the user is not entirely in the wrong. She's trying to set boundaries for her own space and hygiene, which is reasonable. The cousin's behavior is also an issue. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
