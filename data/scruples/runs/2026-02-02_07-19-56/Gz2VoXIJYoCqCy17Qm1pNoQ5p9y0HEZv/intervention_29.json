I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to understand the details.\n\nSo, the author is a 15-year-old girl whose 15-year-old male cousin stays in her room when they visit. She catches him masturbating in her bed twice. She tells him not to do it in her bed, but he ignores her. She's frustrated because she has to wash the sheets and feels disrespected. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are teenagers, which is a time when body autonomy and boundaries are developing. However, the author is setting a boundary about her bed. The cousin is using her bed, which is her personal space. The author is asking him to respect that space by not masturbating there. \n\nMasturbation itself is a normal behavior, but the location might be the issue here. If the bed is the author's, then she has the right to set boundaries about how it's used. The cousin's response\u2014that he can do what he wants with his body\u2014might be dismissive of her right to set those boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might be problematic. Catching someone in the act and then embarrassing them could be seen as invasive. The first time, she caught him, said she didn't care but asked him not to do it. The second time, she got angry. Instead of a calm approach, maybe she could have discussed the issue privately without public embarrassment.\n\nBut considering the cousin's age and the situation of sharing a room, it's also about mutual respect. The author's concern about having to wash the sheets is practical. The cousin's behavior is directly affecting her, so she's not just being a control freak; there's a tangible consequence.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were disproportionate. She's trying to set a reasonable boundary, which is valid. However, how she enforces it matters. If she's shaming him or embarrassing him publicly, that's different from calmly addressing the issue. The cousin's disrespect in dismissing her concerns is also a factor. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, but her method of dealing with it might be. The cousin's behavior is also disrespectful. However, the question is about the author's responsibility. Since she's trying to maintain her space and hygiene, she's not in the wrong. The cousin's response is the problem here. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
