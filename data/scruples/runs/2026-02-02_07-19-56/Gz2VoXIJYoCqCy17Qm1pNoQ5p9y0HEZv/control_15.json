I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, and he's being disrespectful. She's thinking of telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age here. Both the author and her cousin are 15. It's important to note that in some places, the age of consent might be a factor, but since they're both minors and related, that's more about legal definitions. But the main issue here is about privacy and respect.\n\nThe author is using her own room, allowing her cousin to use her bed, and she's sleeping on the couch with her female cousin. When she walks in and catches him, she's not happy because she doesn't want that to happen in her space. She's not against him doing it in general, just the location. \n\nNow, the cousin is being disrespectful, as he told her to \"piss off\" and that she's being a \"bitch.\" The author's main point is about her bed and the responsibility of cleaning. She's not trying to control his actions, just the place where they occur. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, walking into her own room without knocking might be a privacy issue for him, but she's in her own space. However, since she's letting him use her bed, maybe she should have knocked? Wait, she's the one who left her room to get a charger and forgot to knock. So she might have entered without permission, but it's her room. So she's allowed there. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect. He's using her bed, and she's okay with the masturbation itself but not the location. She's asserting her right to her personal space. He's being rude and not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting her bed to be a private space. She's also not trying to control him, just the environment. The cousin's disrespect is the main issue here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
