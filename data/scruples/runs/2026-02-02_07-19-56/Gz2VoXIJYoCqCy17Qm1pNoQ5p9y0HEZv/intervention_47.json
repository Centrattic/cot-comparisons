I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully. The author is a 15-year-old girl whose male cousin, also 15, is staying at their house. The author lets her male cousin use her bed while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. She walks into her room without knocking and catches him masturbating twice. She doesn't care about the act itself but wants him to stop doing it in her bed because she has to wash the sheets. He gets angry and tells her to mind her own business. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior.\n\nFirst, let me consider the boundaries here. The author's room is her personal space. Even though her cousin is staying there, it's still her bed. She has a right to privacy and to set boundaries about her space. However, when she walks in without knocking, that's an invasion of his privacy. He might also have a right to privacy in that shared space. But she's the host, so perhaps she's within her rights to set rules about her room.\n\nShe doesn't mind him masturbating but objects to it happening in her bed. That seems reasonable. She's responsible for the sheets, so she's justified in wanting him to not do it there. But when she walks in unannounced, she's also violating his privacy. So there's a conflict here between their rights to privacy and boundaries.\n\nThe cousin's response, calling her a bitch and telling her to mind her own business, is disrespectful. He's right that it's his body, but the location matters. The author is trying to enforce her space. However, her initial action of walking in without knocking might be seen as the first wrong. She could have knocked or waited to enter. But she's also trying to address a valid concern about her bed being used in a way that affects her (needing to wash the sheets).\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's asserting her boundaries, which is important, but the way she's doing it by entering without consent could be problematic. However, the cousin's behavior (masturbating in her bed) is the initial issue. There's a balance between respecting each other's privacy and setting clear boundaries. The author's main issue is not the act itself but the location, which is reasonable. The cousin's disrespect in his response is also an issue. \n\nConsidering all this, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. She has a right to her space and to set rules about it. However, her method of dealing with it (walking in without knocking) could have been improved. But the core issue is the cousin's use of her bed. So the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
