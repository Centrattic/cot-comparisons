I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is 15 years old, and so is her male cousin. They're staying at her house, and he uses her bed while she sleeps on the couch. She caught him masturbating twice in her bed. She's upset because she doesn't want that happening in her bed, as she's the one washing the sheets. \n\nNow, the key points here: The cousin was in her space (her bed) doing something private. The author is expressing her discomfort and setting a boundary. She didn't confront him the first time, but the second time she got angry and considered calling the parents. \n\nMasturbation isn't illegal, and teenagers might engage in it. However, doing it in someone else's bed without considering their feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is setting a boundary about her personal space and hygiene. She's not trying to shame him for the act itself, but the location. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's asserting her right to her own space. The cousin's response was dismissive and rude (\"piss off, it's his body\"). The author's reaction might be seen as reasonable because she's trying to maintain her comfort and cleanliness. However, embarrassing him could be a harsh reaction. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The main issue is that she's enforcing a boundary she's entitled to. She's not judging his actions, just the location. The cousin's behavior was disrespectful by doing it in her bed without considering her, so her reaction is in self-defense of her space. \n\nHowever, the method she used to address it (embarrassing him) might be questionable. But since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because she's protecting her space and privacy. The cousin's actions were the initial disrespect, so her standing up for herself isn't wrong.\n"
