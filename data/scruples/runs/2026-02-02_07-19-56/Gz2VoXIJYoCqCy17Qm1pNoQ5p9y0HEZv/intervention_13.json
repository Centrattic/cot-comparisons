I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a 15-year-old girl catches her male cousin of the same age masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want that in her bed, and when confronted, he dismisses her. Now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 15, her cousin is 15. They're both teenagers, so their understanding of privacy and boundaries might be developing. The cousin is using her bed, and she's sleeping on the couch. She caught him twice. The first time, she just asked him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he was disrespectful, and she's considering reporting him.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author might be in the wrong, but they want to know my take. Let me think. The cousin is in his own body, so he has a right to privacy. However, the bed belongs to the author, and she's using it as her own space. So there's a conflict between personal privacy and respect for the owner's space.\n\nMasturbation isn't inherently wrong, but doing it in someone else's bed could be an issue if the owner is uncomfortable. The author's main point is that she doesn't want it in her bed because she's the one who has to wash the sheets. That's a practical concern, but also a matter of personal boundaries. The cousin, on the other hand, is asserting his right to his own body, which is valid, but he's in a shared space.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual respect. The cousin might not have considered the author's discomfort, especially since he's in her space. However, the author walked in on him without knocking, which could be a privacy issue. But since he was in her room (her space) and she's the one who has to deal with the aftermath, maybe her concern is valid.\n\nBut is she being a \"bitch\"? The cousin's response was disrespectful, but the author is standing up for her space. The problem is the age factor. Both are teenagers, so their behavior might be typical for their age, but they need to learn boundaries. The author's intention is to set a boundary, not to shame him. However, embarrassing him could be a problem if it's done publicly or in a mean way. The original question is about whether she's in the wrong for embarrassing him.\n\nIf she confronted him privately and asked him to stop, that's reasonable. But if she's spreading it around or making a big deal, that's different. The original scenario says she's considering telling her aunt and uncle. That could be seen as overstepping if the issue was already addressed. However, if he's being disrespectful, she might feel it's necessary.\n\nSo, the author's actions in catching him and addressing it might be justified, but the way she's handling it could be problematic. However, the main issue is about her right to her space vs. his right to privacy. I think the author isn't in the wrong because she's asserting her boundaries, but the cousin's behavior is also an issue. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. Given that she's the one who owns the space and is trying to set reasonable boundaries, I'd say she's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any other angle. Maybe the act of walking in without knocking was her fault? But the cousin didn't lock the door, so maybe he should have considered privacy. It's a bit of a grey area. But overall, I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
