I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. The author is 15 and shares a room with her male cousin and a female cousin stays on the couch. She caught him twice without knocking, and he was disrespectful. She wants to report him but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cousin is using her bed and not locking the door. She caught him twice, which could be a privacy issue. She's not upset about the masturbation itself but about it happening in her bed. She's concerned about washing sheets and the respect issue.\n\nMasturbation is a normal, private activity. However, doing it in someone else's bed might be an invasion of their space. The cousin didn't lock the door, leading to the author walking in. She's asking him to not do it in her bed, which is reasonable. He responded disrespectfully, which she found offensive.\n\nThe author's main issue is the location, not the act itself. She's not forbidding it but asking for privacy in her own bed. The cousin's behavior could be seen as disrespectful, especially if it's a recurring issue. The author's reaction of getting angry and planning to inform the parents might be seen as justified if there's a repeated lack of respect.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? She didn't knock first. However, she's the one whose room and bed it is. Maybe she should have knocked, but if he's not locking the door, he's inviting that. Also, she's the one who has to deal with the consequences (washing sheets). So her stance is about maintaining boundaries in her own space. \n\nThe cousin's argument is that it's his body, but the location matters. It's about respecting others' spaces. The author isn't judging the act but the place. So she's not in the wrong. The cousin's disrespect is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
