I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in their bed. The situation involves the 15-year-old female author and her 15-year-old male cousin. The cousin is staying in her bed, and she catches him masturbating twice. She's upset because she doesn't want that in her bed, especially since she has to wash the sheets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are teenagers, so they're still learning about boundaries and privacy. The author isn't upset about the masturbation itself but about the location. She's clear that it's natural, but she wants her bed respected. The cousin is dismissive and rude, which is probably why she's considering telling her parents.\n\nThe key points here are privacy and respect. The cousin is using her bed and not locking the door, which leads to the author walking in on him. She's not trying to shame him for his actions but for the lack of consideration regarding her space. The cousin's response is disrespectful, which escalates the situation.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, she's standing up for her personal space. She's not judging the act itself but the location. Her intention is to set boundaries, which is a reasonable thing to do. The cousin's behavior is the issue here\u2014he's not respecting her space by not locking the door and being disrespectful when confronted. The author's reaction is about maintaining her own environment, which is valid. She isn't being a \"bitch\" for wanting her bed to be respected. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
