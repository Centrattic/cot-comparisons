I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 15-year-old girl who sometimes lets her male cousin sleep in her bed while she sleeps on the couch. She walked in on him masturbating twice, which she found inappropriate because it's her bed. She's upset he's not respecting her space, and he responded rudely. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, the key points: She's the one who initially let him have her bed, and she didn't knock when she entered the room. The cousin was in his own home, so he might have a right to privacy. However, she's the one whose bed he's using, so there's a conflict. She's the one who has to wash the sheets, which adds to her concern. She's not trying to stop him from masturbating but wants him to do it elsewhere. He dismissed her, which escalated the issue.\n\nNow, should she be in the wrong? Well, she didn't knock, which is a problem. She walked into his room without permission, which invades his privacy. Even if she's upset, entering without knocking is a privacy issue. However, she's also in her own home, and she's the one who gave him the bed. So maybe she has a point about the bed being hers. But her actions (not knocking) led to the confrontation. The cousin's behavior might be inappropriate in a shared space, but the author's method of addressing it (embarrassing him) isn't constructive. She's considering confronting her aunt and uncle, which is a family matter.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author not respecting the cousin's privacy by walking in without knocking. That's a key point. Even though she's upset about the bed, her approach might be part of the problem. She's in the wrong because she didn't knock, leading to the situation. The cousin's response was rude, but the initial transgression was hers. So the answer is A.\n"
