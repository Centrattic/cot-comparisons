I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is that the author, a 15-year-old girl, catches her male cousin, who's also 15, masturbating in her bed while he's staying at her house. She tells him not to do it in her bed, which he ignores, and now she's considering telling his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are 15, so they're teenagers. Masturbation is a normal part of adolescent development, but the context matters here. He's in her bed, which is her personal space. She's upset because she has to wash the sheets, but also because she feels disrespected. He's being disrespectful back, saying it's his body and she's being a bitch.\n\nThe author is caught in a situation where she's trying to set boundaries about her personal space. She's not against him masturbating per se, just the location. The cousin is using her room and not locking the door, which leads to her catching him twice. She's frustrated and considering involving his parents.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's asserting her right to her own space and the cleanliness of her belongings. It's reasonable for her to ask him not to do something in her bed that she's uncomfortable with. However, how she handles it might matter. If she confronts him in a respectful way, that's one thing. But if she's shaming him or embarrassing him, that could be an issue. The original question is whether she's wrong for embarrassing him.\n\nThe key points are boundaries and respect. She's trying to maintain her space, but the cousin is also a teenager who might not realize the impact of his actions. The fact that she's the one washing the sheets adds a practical concern. She's not stopping him from masturbating altogether, just the location. However, her response to his disrespect might be where the line is crossed. Telling his parents could be a way to address the behavior if she feels it's necessary, but maybe she should try talking to him first without shaming him.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's caught him in the act and is upset about it, maybe her initial reaction was to embarrass him, which could be problematic. The title of the situation is \"Would I Be The Asshole (WIBTA) for embarrassing my cousin...\" So the user is asking if she's wrong for embarrassing him. If she embarrassed him, that's one thing, but if she's just asserting boundaries, that's another. The line between setting boundaries and being disrespectful can be thin here.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, even though it's natural, doing it in someone else's bed without considering their feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. The cousin's response of being disrespectful towards her might justify her feeling the need to involve parents. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's being shaming or using that as an excuse to get him in trouble, maybe. If she's genuinely concerned about hygiene and boundaries, she's not in the wrong. However, the act of embarrassing him might be where the line is crossed. But the user is asking if she's wrong, so considering all factors, I think she's not in the wrong because she's trying to maintain her space, even if her approach could be better. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
