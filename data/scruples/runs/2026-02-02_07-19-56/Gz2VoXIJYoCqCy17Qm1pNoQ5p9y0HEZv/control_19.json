I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing her cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. The cousin is 15, same age as her. She lets him take her bed while she sleeps on the couch. She caught him twice, and now she's considering telling his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the situation. The cousin is in her room, using her bed, and he's doing something private. The author is upset because she's the one who has to wash the sheets. She doesn't care about the act itself but the location. She confronted him, and he was disrespectful. Now she's thinking of involving his parents.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Let's break it down. The cousin is in her space; he's using her bed. Even though he's staying there as a guest, the act of masturbating in someone else's bed might be a privacy issue. The author has a right to her personal space. But she walked in on him, which might have been unexpected. She's not his parent, so does she have the right to tell him not to do that?\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, if she's the one providing the space, she can set boundaries. However, the act of masturbation is a personal choice. But doing it in someone else's bed might be a line. She's not his parent, so maybe it's overstepping to dictate his behavior. But again, it's his body. However, in a shared space, there are mutual expectations of privacy and respect.\n\nShe caught him twice, and he was disrespectful. She's considering telling his parents. If she's not the parent, is it her place? Or is it a family matter? Maybe she's justified in wanting to protect her own space and the cleanliness of her sheets. But embarrassing him might be an issue. She's upset because he disrespected her, but he's arguing it's his body. There's a balance between personal privacy and respecting the host's space.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's setting boundaries for her own space, maybe not. But if she's overstepping by dictating his personal behavior, maybe yes. But given that he's in her room, she has a right to ask for certain behaviors. The key is whether the act in her bed is a reasonable boundary. Since she's the one providing the bed and will handle the washing, maybe her request is reasonable. But the way she's handling it\u2014embarrassing him\u2014might be the issue. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for the situation as a whole.\n\nI think the main point is that she's asserting her right to her space. The cousin's behavior in her room might be the problem. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
