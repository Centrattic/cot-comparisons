I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 15-year-old girl who's had her male cousin stay in her room. She caught him masturbating in her bed twice. She doesn't mind that he does it, but she wants it out of her bed. The cousin responded disrespectfully, and she's considering telling his parents.\n\nFirst, she's trying to set boundaries about her personal space. She's the one who uses the bed, so it's reasonable that she wants him to not do that there. The cousin was being disrespectful, which she's justified in being upset about. She's not trying to shame him for his natural behavior, just asking for respect in her space. \n\nThe key points here are her right to privacy and space. Even though they're cousins, she's asserting her boundaries. The cousin's behavior of not locking the door and continuing despite her request is the issue. She's not being a \"bitch\" here; she's standing up for herself. \n\nCalling the parents might be a step, but the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's setting reasonable boundaries and the cousin is the one being disrespectful, the answer should be B.\n"
