I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl who's upset because her 15-year-old male cousin keeps masturbating in her bed when he's staying over. She caught him twice and is considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: both are minors, so their actions might be seen differently than adults. In many places, minors have some privacy rights, but since he's in her room, maybe not. Also, the bed is hers, so she might have a right to privacy there.\n\nEthically, she's not trying to stop him from masturbating, just from doing it in her bed. She's concerned about washing the sheets, which is a practical issue. The cousin is being disrespectful, saying she's a bitch and that he can do what he wants. That's a problem because he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nHer response is to embarrass him, which could be seen as harsh, especially with minors. But she's asserting her right to her space. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If she just wants him to stop using her bed for that, she's not wrong. However, the method of embarrassing him might be problematic. Maybe she should have talked to him calmly first. But since he didn't listen, her next step could be involving parents, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She's not wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The cousin is disrespectful, so she's justified in taking action. The answer is B.\n"
