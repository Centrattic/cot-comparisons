I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. The user wants to know if the author is being unreasonable or justified.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author is 15, female, and has a male cousin of the same age. When the cousins visit, the male cousin takes her bed, and she sleeps on the couch with the female cousin. She caught him masturbating in her bed twice. She told him not to do it in her bed, and he responded disrespectfully. Now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent, privacy, and respect. Even though the cousin is staying in her bed, does he have the right to masturbate there? Well, the bed is hers, so she probably has the right to set boundaries. Masturbating in someone else's bed might be considered inappropriate, especially if the owner is uncomfortable with it. The cousin's actions could be seen as a privacy issue because he's not locking the door, and she's in the house. \n\nThe author's response: she caught him twice, got angry, and now wants to inform her aunt and uncle. She's considering whether she's overreacting. The cousin is being disrespectful, which she's addressing. It's natural for adolescents to masturbate, but doing it in someone else's bed without considering their feelings might be crossing a line. The author isn't trying to stop him from masturbating, just from doing it in her bed. She's the one who has to clean the sheets, which adds to her frustration. \n\nIs she in the wrong for setting these boundaries? Probably not. She has a right to her own space and to ask that her bed not be used for that. The cousin's response (\"it's his body\") doesn't negate the fact that he's using her bed without her consent. So the author isn't being unreasonable. She's asserting her boundaries, which is appropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
