I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they embarrassed their cousin for masturbating in their bed. The author is 15 years old, their male cousin is also 15. The scenario involves the cousin staying in the author's room, and they caught him masturbating twice. The author is upset because they don't want that happening in their bed, and they're considering telling the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. Both are teenagers, so their behavior might be more about privacy and boundaries. The author didn't knock the first time, which led to the first incident. Then the second time, the cousin didn't lock the door. The author then got angry and wants to involve the aunt and uncle.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author didn't knock, which could be a problem because it's a privacy issue. If the author walked in without knocking, that might have been the first mistake. Then, the cousin was in the bed, and while masturbation is normal, doing it in someone else's bed might be a boundary issue for the author. The author's concern is about the sheets and the idea of washing them, which is a practical concern, but also about respect.\n\nThe cousin's response was to tell the author to \"piss off\" and dismiss their concerns. The author is considering reporting this to the parents. The key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable. The author did confront the cousin, maybe in a way that was embarrassing. However, the author's initial action of not knocking could be seen as the root issue. The cousin's behavior is private, but doing it in someone else's bed without privacy might be an issue. \n\nThe author's main point is that they don't want it in their bed, not that the cousin is doing it. So, the author's intention is about their own space and boundaries. However, the way they handled it might have been overreacting, especially after the first incident. But the cousin's response was disrespectful as well. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The initial act of not knocking might be a problem, but the cousin was in the bed, and the author's own bed. The author's concern about the sheets is practical. The cousin's behavior is normal but in a shared space. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the way they handled the situation (embarrassing the cousin) might not be the best approach. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The cousin was in the bed, which is the author's space. The author has the right to set boundaries about how their space is used. The cousin's actions were in the author's area, so the author is within their rights to ask for respect. The problem might be the method of confrontation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting their space respected. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
