I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing her cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed.\n\nFirst, let's lay out the facts. The author is a 15-year-old girl, and her male cousin is also 15. They're staying at her house when their family visits. The arrangement is that the male cousin uses her bed, and she sleeps on the couch with the female cousin. She walks into her room without knocking twice and catches him masturbating. She's upset because she doesn't want that in her bed, especially since she's the one who has to wash the sheets. The cousin responds disrespectfully, saying she's being a bitch and that it's his body. The author is considering telling her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, privacy, and respect. When she walks into her room without knocking, that's a privacy issue for the cousin. However, she's in her own space, so maybe she's not at fault there. But then she catches him doing something personal. Her reaction is to express her discomfort and then later to get angry when he doesn't respect her wishes. The cousin is also a minor, so they're both teenagers dealing with natural urges.\n\nNow, the author is trying to set boundaries about her bed, which is reasonable. She's not trying to stop him from masturbating, just from doing it in her bed. The cousin's response is rude and dismissive, which is part of the problem. The author's plan to inform the parents about his disrespectful behavior is a way to address the issue, but the initial act of walking in without knocking might have contributed to the situation. \n\nHowever, the main conflict is the cousin not respecting her wishes. She's trying to maintain a boundary, which is her right. The cousin's behavior of not locking the door and continuing to masturbate despite her request is the disrespectful part. So in this case, the author is asserting her boundaries, which is appropriate, even if the way she handled it (embarrassing him) might not be the best approach. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The cousin's disrespect and lack of privacy consideration when she entered the room without knocking both play roles here.\n\nI think the balance tips towards the author not being in the wrong. She's setting a boundary about her space, and the cousin's response is the issue. The act of walking in without knocking is a privacy issue on her part, but since it's her room, perhaps she's allowed to enter. However, the cousin's actions in her space are the main problem. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
