I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin who was masturbating in their bed. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is 15 years old, and so is the male cousin. They share a house when visiting. The author sleeps on the couch while the cousin uses her bed. She catches him masturbating twice. The first time, she just doesn't care and tells him to stop in her bed. The second time, he ignores her again, and she gets angry, leading to a confrontation where he calls her names. Now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle if she's overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here: privacy, boundaries, age-appropriate behavior. At 15, both are teenagers, and masturbation is a natural part of puberty. However, doing it in someone else's bed without considering their feelings might be an issue. The author is setting a boundary by not wanting it done in her bed, especially since she handles washing the sheets. \n\nIs she in the wrong for enforcing her space? Well, she didn't confront him initially except to ask him to stop. The second time, when he didn't listen, she got angry. But is it wrong to be upset about someone using your personal space in a way that makes you uncomfortable? She's not shaming him for the act itself but for the location. The cousin's response was dismissive and rude, which might justify her wanting to involve the parents. \n\nHowever, maybe she could have handled it differently. Instead of embarrassing him, perhaps talking to him calmly first. But she did ask him to stop, and he ignored her. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally and in terms of social norms, she's asserting her personal space, which is reasonable. The cousin's behavior was inconsiderate. So the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
