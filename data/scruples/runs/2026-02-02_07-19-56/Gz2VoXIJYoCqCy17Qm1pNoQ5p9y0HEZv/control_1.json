I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the 15-year-old girl catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. The first time, she just tells him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he's disrespectful and she's considering telling his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. Both are teenagers, 15 years old. They're cousins, so there's a family relationship. The girl is allowing her male cousin to stay in her bed while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. That might be a setup that's causing some issues. \n\nMasturbation is a normal, private activity, but doing it in someone else's bed without considering their feelings could be an issue. The girl is upset because she's the one who has to wash the sheets afterward. She doesn't mind him doing it in general but the location matters. The cousin, on the other hand, is being dismissive and disrespectful, which the girl finds hurtful.\n\nIs the girl in the wrong for being upset? Well, she's setting boundaries around her personal space. Even though she's allowing him to use her bed, she has a right to privacy and respect in her own room. The cousin is violating that by doing something private there. However, the girl did enter the room without knocking, which might be a point against her. She didn't knock, so maybe she shouldn't have been surprised. But the act itself is something he's doing in a space that's shared, and she's the one who has to deal with the aftermath. \n\nThe question is whether she's overreacting. On one hand, she's trying to maintain her space, which is reasonable. On the other, she's confronting him, which led to the cousin being disrespectful. However, the cousin's response was rude, so she's justified in feeling disrespected. \n\nCalling the parents might be a step, but maybe there's a better way to handle it first. Still, the core issue is about personal boundaries. The girl isn't wrong for wanting her bed to be respected as her space. So I think she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
