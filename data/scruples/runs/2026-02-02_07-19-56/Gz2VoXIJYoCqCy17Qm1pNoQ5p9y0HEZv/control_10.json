I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 15-year-old girl, has her cousin, a 15-year-old boy, staying over. They're sharing the house, and the boy is using her bed while she's on the couch. She catches him masturbating in her bed twice. The first time, she just tells him not to do it in her bed, and the second time, he ignores her and gets defensive.\n\nThe author is upset because she feels disrespected, and she's considering telling her aunt and uncle. She's also questioning whether she's overreacting or if it's justified. \n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, the boy is in a shared space, using her bed. The author has a legitimate concern about hygiene and personal space. Masturbating in someone else's bed could lead to mess, and she's the one who would have to deal with it. That seems reasonable. She's clearly stating her boundaries, which is a normal and healthy thing to do.\n\nThe boy's response is dismissive and disrespectful, telling her to \"piss off\" and that she's being a \"bitch.\" That's not okay. He's not respecting her boundaries, and his behavior is contributing to the problem. The author isn't making a big deal out of nothing; she's trying to set a boundary for a practical reason. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she didn't do anything to provoke this. She's asserting her right to have her space respected. The issue isn't her; it's his inappropriate behavior in a shared space. She's also considering involving her aunt and uncle, which is a reasonable step if her cousin continues to be disrespectful. \n\nAnother angle: age-wise, they're both teenagers, so their behavior is part of growing up. But that doesn't mean the author shouldn't have boundaries. The key points here are consent and respect. The author isn't violating any norms; she's trying to maintain a respectful environment. The cousin is the one crossing the line. \n\nI don't see any fault with the author here. She's handling it appropriately by setting boundaries and addressing the issue when it's repeated. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
