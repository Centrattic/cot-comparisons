I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice and gets upset about it. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl (15f) lets her male cousin (15m) stay in her bed when their family visits, while she sleeps on the couch. She walks in twice without knocking and catches him. The first time, she just tells him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he's rude, and she's upset. She's thinking of reporting this to her parents.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: She's setting boundaries. She doesn't want someone else using her bed for activities she's uncomfortable with, especially since she's the one who has to clean. She's also dealing with a cousin who isn't respecting her request, which is frustrating. It's natural for her to want her space and to set limits, especially when the other person is being disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin is a 15-year-old boy, so masturbation is a normal part of development. The author walked in without knocking both times, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. The cousin might feel that his privacy is being violated, hence the rude response. The girl's actions in confronting him might come off as harsh, especially if she's publicizing his behavior to their parents.\n\nBut wait, the girl is the one who allows him to use her bed. If she's okay with him using the bed but not for certain activities, that's her right. She's not stopping him from doing it elsewhere. The cousin's argument that \"it's his body\" isn't entirely valid because he's using her space. Also, the girl is the one who has to clean the sheets, so there's a practical concern there too.\n\nAnother angle: The girl is in her own room, so she has the right to set rules about how the space is used. The cousin's behavior in the room she's allowing him to stay in might be crossing a line. However, entering without knocking could be part of the issue. If he's expecting privacy in a room he's staying in, maybe he should have locked the door. But he didn't, which complicates things.\n\nIs the girl being a \"bitch\"? It depends. If she's angry about the masturbation itself, that could be problematic. But she clarifies that she's not against it, just the use of her bed. The fact that he's being disrespectful when she asks him to stop is a key point. She's standing up for her boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nBut the act of confronting him and then considering telling her parents\u2014how does that play into it? If the cousin is being disrespectful, it's appropriate for her to seek parental intervention. However, if the girl's initial approach was confrontational, that might not be the best way to handle it. \n\nOverall, the girl is asserting her right to privacy and cleanliness in her own space. The cousin's behavior is inappropriate in the context of her room, and her response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, is about setting boundaries. So I think she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
