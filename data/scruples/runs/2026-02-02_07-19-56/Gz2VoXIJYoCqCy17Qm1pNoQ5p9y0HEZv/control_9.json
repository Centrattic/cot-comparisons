I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, and when she confronts him, he gets defensive. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are 15, so they're teenagers. The author is the one whose bed he's using, and she's the one who has to deal with washing the sheets. The cousin is being disrespectful, according to her. The key points here are privacy, boundaries, and respect.\n\nWhen the author enters her room without knocking, maybe that's an issue. But she had forgotten her charger. She didn't knock, but she's in her own room. Wait, but she's in her room. If it's her room, then maybe she's supposed to have control over it. However, if the cousin is staying there, maybe there's an expectation of privacy. But she's the one who lets him take her bed. So perhaps there's an agreement about the space.\n\nThe cousin is masturbating, which is a private activity. The author is upset because it's happening in her bed. She's not against him doing it, just the location. The cousin, however, is defensive and dismissive. The author is considering reporting this to the parents. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. She's in her own room, which she allows him to use. She caught him without knocking, but that's her room. However, maybe she should have knocked first. But she was getting her charger, which she forgot. She might be in a hurry. The cousin not locking the door is also part of the problem. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the bed is hers, and she has to wash the sheets. So she's concerned about hygiene and personal space. The cousin's response is disrespectful. The author is asserting her boundaries, which is reasonable. The cousin's behavior is violating her space, so she's trying to set boundaries. \n\nIs she overstepping? Maybe not. She's not trying to control his actions, just where he does it. She's not being judgmental about the act itself, just the location. The cousin's response is the problem here. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's maintaining her boundaries and addressing a legitimate concern about her space and hygiene. The cousin's behavior is the issue, not hers. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
