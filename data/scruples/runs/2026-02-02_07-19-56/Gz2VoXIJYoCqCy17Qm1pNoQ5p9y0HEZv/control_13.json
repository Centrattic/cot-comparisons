I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, and he's being disrespectful. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The cousin is 15, same age as the author. The main issue is the cousin using the author's bed for masturbation, which she finds disrespectful. The author doesn't mind the act itself but the location. The cousin is uncooperative and dismissive.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's standing up for her personal space. The bed is hers, so she has the right to set boundaries. The cousin's behavior could be seen as invading her space, and she's trying to maintain privacy. However, since they're both minors, maybe there's a different approach. But the author isn't forcing him to stop; she's just trying to communicate her discomfort. The cousin's disrespectful response is problematic. The author's intent is to have her bed respected, not to shame him for his actions. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
