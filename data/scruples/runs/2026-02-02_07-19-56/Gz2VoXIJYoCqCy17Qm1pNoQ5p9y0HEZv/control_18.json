I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, especially since she has to wash the sheets. The cousin responded disrespectfully, saying she's being a bitch. The author is considering informing the aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and context. Both are teenagers, so some behavior might be typical. The author is sharing her bed with her cousin, which might not be ideal. She's upset about the privacy issue\u2014her cousin not locking the door. She's not against him masturbating per se, just the location. The cousin's response was disrespectful, but is her reaction justified?\n\nThe key points: She's the one who has to do the washing, so there's a practical concern. She's standing up for her boundaries. However, the way she's addressing it by potentially calling the parents might be seen as overstepping, especially if she's just embarrassed and not actually in physical danger. Also, the cousin is a minor, and it's a family matter. Is embarrassing him the right approach? Maybe she should have talked to him privately first instead of escalating to the parents. But given that he disrespected her, she might feel justified in seeking adult intervention.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's asserting her boundaries, which is okay. But if she's using this as an excuse to get him in trouble rather than addressing the actual issue (privacy/bed use), maybe she's overreacting. However, since he didn't respect her initial request, escalating makes sense. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
