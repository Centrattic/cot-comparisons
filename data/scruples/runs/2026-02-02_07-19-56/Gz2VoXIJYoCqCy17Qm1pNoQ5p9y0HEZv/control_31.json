I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 15 years old and has a 15-year-old male cousin who stays in her bed when they visit. The author caught her cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She told him not to do it in her bed, but he ignored her and was rude. Now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the age here. Both are teenagers, so maybe they're not fully aware of social norms yet. The author is making a request about her bed, which is a personal space. She's not saying he can't masturbate, just not in her bed. That seems reasonable because she's the one who would have to clean it. \n\nHer cousin is being disrespectful by not listening and responding rudely. The author is standing up for her boundaries, which is important. She's not trying to control his body, just his behavior in her space. \n\nBut wait, does she have the authority to tell him that? Since they're the same age, maybe she's overstepping? But she's also the one whose space is being invaded. She's not his parent, but she's the one who has to deal with the consequences. \n\nIs it a big deal? She's trying to maintain respect in a shared space. The cousin's behavior is inappropriate in that setting, especially since he's ignoring her wishes. The author is protecting her personal space and hygiene, which are valid concerns. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her boundaries, which is necessary. The cousin's actions are the issue here, not her standing up for herself. The answer should be B.\n"
