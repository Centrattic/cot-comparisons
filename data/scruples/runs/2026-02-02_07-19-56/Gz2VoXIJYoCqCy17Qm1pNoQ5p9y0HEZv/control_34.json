I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (a 15-year-old girl) is in the wrong for embarrassing her cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. \n\nFirst, the situation: She allows her male cousin to use her bed when they visit, and he's doing something private there. She catches him twice. The first time, she just tells him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he disrespects her, and she's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nSo, the key points here. Is she in the wrong? Well, she's the one who owns the bed. Even though he's staying there, it's her bed. She's asking him to not do something there, which is reasonable. Masturbation is a private act, and doing it in someone else's bed might not be considered appropriate. She's making a point about cleanliness and ownership, which makes sense. \n\nBut then, when he disrespects her, she's upset. Her reaction to call his parents could be seen as a way to address the disrespect. However, she doesn't want to embarrass him, but she's considering it. The question is whether she's the one in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: She's a teenager, and maybe she's overreacting. But she's standing up for her personal space. On the other hand, he's also a teenager, and privacy in shared spaces can be tricky. But she's the one who set the boundary. He violated it twice, especially after being told. \n\nAlso, she's not judging the act itself but the location. She says she doesn't care that he does it, just not in her bed. That seems like a valid boundary. So, she's not wrong for setting that boundary. The cousin's response was disrespectful, so her wanting to involve the parents might be justified.\n\nBut maybe the user is supposed to consider cultural or family norms. Some might say teenagers shouldn't be doing that in someone else's bed. Others might think it's a minor issue. However, the user is concerned about being labeled as a \"bitch,\" but she's asserting her right to her space.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because she's setting a boundary about her own bed, and the cousin was disrespectful. She's not shaming him for the act itself but the location. The wrong here is more on the cousin for not respecting her space and being rude. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
