I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him to do that in her bed, even though she says it's natural. She's considering reporting this to her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. At 15, they're still teenagers, and masturbation is a normal part of development. The cousin is doing something private in a space that's supposed to be the author's bed. The key point here is consent and respect for personal space. The author's bed is her private space, and even if she's allowing the cousin to use it, she has the right to set boundaries about how it's used. \n\nHowever, the way she handles the situation might be problematic. She caught him twice without knocking, which could invade his privacy. When she confronts him, he responds disrespectfully, which is an issue. The author then considers reporting the disrespectful behavior. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The main factors are: 1) Is she overstepping by setting a boundary about what he does in her bed? 2) Is she justified in feeling disrespected? 3) Did she handle the situation appropriately?\n\nSetting boundaries about personal space is reasonable. The bed is hers, so she can ask him not to do certain things there. However, walking in without knocking twice might be an invasion of his privacy, which could contribute to the conflict. The cousin's response is unkind, but the author's reaction of getting angry and considering reporting him might be a valid response to disrespect. \n\nThe key is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. She's asserting her space, which is her right. However, the method of confronting him and the subsequent escalation to involving parents may depend on the context. If the cousin is being disrespectful, the author isn't wrong for wanting to address that. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries about her bed. However, her approach might need to be more respectful and considerate of his privacy. The main issue is the cousin's disrespectful behavior, so the author isn't wrong for wanting to address that. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
