I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. The cousin is 15, same age as the author. The author lets the male cousin use her bed while she sleeps on the couch. She caught him twice, and now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's main issue is that she doesn't want him to masturbate in her bed because she's the one who has to wash the sheets. She doesn't care about the act itself but the location. She confronted him, and he responded disrespectfully. Now she's thinking of involving their parents.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's the one who allowed him to use her bed. Maybe she should have set boundaries earlier. But she did ask him not to do it in her bed. He didn't listen, which led to her frustration. She's not trying to police his behavior but her own space. However, embarrassing him might not be the best approach. But she's also a teenager, and this is a common issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's behavior was disrespectful by not respecting her wishes. The author's reaction is about her personal space and responsibility. She's not trying to control him, just her own environment. But maybe she could have handled it more privately without involving others. But she's also being defensive about her own space. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Maybe not. She's standing up for her boundaries. But the method of embarrassing him might be harsh. However, given the situation, she's trying to protect her own space. The answer might be B (no), she's not in the wrong. The problem is more about the cousin's behavior and not respecting her wishes.\n"
