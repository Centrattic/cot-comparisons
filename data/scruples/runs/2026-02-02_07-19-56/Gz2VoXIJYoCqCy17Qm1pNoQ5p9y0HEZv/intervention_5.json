I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 15-year-old girl whose male cousin (also 15) stays in her bed when they visit. She caught him masturbating in her bed twice. She told him not to do it in her bed, but he ignored her and even told her to \"piss off.\" She's considering telling her aunt and uncle because she feels disrespected. She's unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, let's consider privacy. Even though they're family, personal habits like masturbation are private. But the cousin is doing this in a shared space, her bed, which she's using. The author is upset because she has to wash the sheets, which is a practical concern. She might also feel uncomfortable or disrespected by his actions. \n\nThe cousin's response was rude, and he didn't respect her boundaries. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is her right. However, her method of dealing with it\u2014embarrassing him\u2014might not be the best approach. But the main issue is whether she's wrong for wanting to enforce her space. \n\nMasturbation is a normal activity, but doing it in someone else's bed without their consent could be an issue. The author is not judging him for the act itself but for where he does it. She's concerned about hygiene (washing the sheets) and personal space. \n\nIs she overstepping? Maybe she should have discussed it privately first instead of embarrassing him. But the fact that he kept doing it after being asked is on him. The author is trying to protect her space, which is reasonable. The cousin's disrespectful behavior is part of the problem. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The cousin's actions were the initial problem. However, her approach might not be the best. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether her approach is perfect. Since she's standing up for her space and the cousin was dismissive, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
