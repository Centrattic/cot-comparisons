I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after embarrassing her cousin for masturbating in her bed. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the cousin is 15 years old, same age as the author. He's staying in her bed while visiting, and she's on the couch with the female cousin. She caught him masturbating twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, mainly because she'll have to wash the sheets. The cousin responded disrespectfully, saying it's his body and she's being a bitch.\n\nSo, the author is considering telling her aunt and uncle. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nMasturbation is a natural and private activity, especially for adolescents. However, doing it in someone else's bed without considering their feelings might be an issue. The author's main concern is about the bed being her space and the responsibility of cleaning. She doesn't seem to be judging him for the act itself but the location and respect for her space.\n\nThe cousin's response was disrespectful, which is a problem. The author's reaction was to embarrass him, which might be seen as harsh, but her intentions were about setting boundaries. However, using embarrassment could be a way to enforce that boundary. Alternatively, maybe she should have addressed it more calmly first.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she has a right to her space and can set boundaries. But the method of addressing it by embarrassing him might not be the best approach. However, the cousin's behavior was also disrespectful. It's a bit of a gray area. Since she's the one who owns the bed, she's not wrong for wanting respect for her space. The cousin's actions invading her space without consent are problematic. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
