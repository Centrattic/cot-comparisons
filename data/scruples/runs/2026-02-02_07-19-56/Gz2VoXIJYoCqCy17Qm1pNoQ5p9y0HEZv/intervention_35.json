I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in their bed. The situation involves two 15-year-old cousins. The author, a girl, allows her male cousin to use her bed while she sleeps on the couch. She catches him twice, and he responds disrespectfully. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and context. At 15, they're teenagers, which is a time when privacy and personal boundaries are important. The author's bed is her personal space, so it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. She's not judging his actions, just the location. She's concerned about washing the sheets, which is practical. \n\nThe cousin's behavior of not locking the door and being disrespectful when confronted could be an issue. The author isn't trying to control his actions, just where he does them. She's not prying or being judgmental, just asserting her space. \n\nOn the other hand, walking in without knocking might be on the author's side. Maybe she should have knocked to respect his privacy if he's in the room. But she was there to get her charger, so her intent was reasonable. \n\nThe key points are about mutual respect. She has a right to her space, and he has a right to privacy. However, since it's her bed, she can set rules. The author's reaction is justified as she's trying to maintain her comfort and cleanliness. The cousin's disrespect is part of the problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her space without being judgmental. The uncle's behavior and not respecting her boundary is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
