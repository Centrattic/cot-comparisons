I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl whose male cousin, also 15, has been staying in her room. She caught him masturbating in her bed twice. The first time, she asked him not to do it in her bed, but he continued and even got angry at her. Now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and maturity levels. Both are teenagers, so they might not have the best judgment in these situations. The girl is asserting her boundaries by asking him not to do it in her bed. That seems reasonable. She's not trying to control his actions entirely but just where he does it. The cousin's reaction\u2014telling her to \"piss off\" and calling her a \"bitch\"\u2014is disrespectful and could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are consent and personal space. Even though it's his body, doing it in her bed affects her as the one who has to clean up. She has a valid concern about hygiene and privacy. However, the way she might handle it could matter. If she confronts him in a respectful way, that's different from embarrassing him. The original question is whether she's in the wrong if she embarrasses him. If she's caught him and now wants to escalate by telling her aunt and uncle, that might be crossing a line. But her intent is to address disrespectful behavior, not just to embarrass him.\n\nBut wait, the scenario says she's considering embarrassing him again by telling others. Is that justified? If she's already set boundaries and he's ignored them, then informing her aunt and uncle could be a way to enforce those boundaries. However, the act of \"embarrassing\" him might not be the right approach. Maybe she should talk to her parents first or address it more privately. But the question is specifically about her being in the wrong for embarrassing him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, she's not in the wrong for wanting to maintain her personal space and cleanliness. The cousin's behavior is the issue here. She has the right to ask him not to use her bed for that. However, if her method of addressing it is by embarrassing him in front of others, that could be seen as retaliating. But given the context, she's trying to set boundaries. So the answer might be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
