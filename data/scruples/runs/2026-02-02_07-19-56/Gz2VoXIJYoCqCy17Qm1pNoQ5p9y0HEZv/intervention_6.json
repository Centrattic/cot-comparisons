I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl catching her male cousin, also 15, masturbating in her bed twice. She feels disrespected when he ignores her request to stop, and now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and relationship. Both are teenagers, and the cousin is staying in her room. The girl is in a position where she's allowing her male cousin to use her bed while she sleeps on the couch. She catches him twice, and he responds disrespectfully. She doesn't care about the act itself but wants it out of the bed because she's the one who has to clean it.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. Since he's in her room and using her space, she has the right to set boundaries. Even though he's a minor, he's still responsible for respecting her space. The girl is within her rights to ask him to stop an activity in her space that she's uncomfortable with. The fact that she's the one washing the sheets adds a practical reason for her request.\n\nHowever, some might argue that teenagers exploring their sexuality is natural, and the girl shouldn't be overly concerned. But she's not condemning him; she's just asking for respect regarding her personal space. The cousin's disrespectful response and refusal to comply might justify her taking action. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? The author wants to know if she's being a \"bitch\" by reporting this. The act itself isn't the issue; it's the context of her space and his disregard. Since she's clearly stating her boundaries and he's violating them, she's not in the wrong. The issue is about mutual respect in shared living situations. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
