I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin, also 15, masturbating in her bed during a visit. She's upset because she doesn't want that to happen and is considering telling her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The cousin was staying in her bed, and she found him masturbating there twice. She's not against him doing it in general but doesn't want it in her bed. The cousin dismissed her, saying it's his body and she's being a bitch. She's thinking of reporting this to her aunt and uncle.\n\nNow, considering the age of the individuals, they're both 15. At that age, they might not fully understand privacy boundaries or social norms. The author is upset because she's the one who has to clean the sheets, which is a practical concern. She's also feeling disrespected when he ignores her request.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The cousin was in her room without knocking, which is a privacy issue. She's asking him to respect her space, which is reasonable. However, the way she's handling it by considering informing the parents might be harsh. The cousin is a minor, and this could be a lesson in privacy and respecting others' boundaries. But the author is also a minor, so the dynamics here are between peers.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, she's not wrong in wanting her space. It's natural for a teenager to feel uncomfortable about that. However, her reaction might be seen as overstepping if she's not considering his privacy as well. But since he was in her room without knocking, she has a right to set boundaries. The key is mutual respect here. She's not wrong for asking him to respect her space, but she should also consider his maturity level and maybe handle it more privately first instead of going to the parents immediately. But since he was disrespectful and dismissed her, her reaction might be justified. So the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
