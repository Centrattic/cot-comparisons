I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the original story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 15 years old, and her male cousin, also 15, is staying over. She lets him use her bed while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. She catches him masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she feels disrespected and wants him to stop using her bed for that. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy, boundaries, and age-appropriate behavior. At 15, both the author and her cousin are teenagers. Masturbation is a normal part of adolescent development, but the context matters. The author is the one providing the bed, and she's responsible for the sheets, which adds to her frustration.\n\nNow, the author walked in on him without knocking the first time. That could be an issue because she didn't knock, which might have invaded his privacy. However, she did mention it was her room. But since he was in her space, maybe she has a right to be there. The second time, he didn't lock the door, which complicates things. Did he take any steps to ensure privacy?\n\nThe author's response was to express her displeasure, but she's considering reporting the cousin to the parents. Is that justified? The cousin is a minor, so there's a line about how adults handle such situations. The author's main issue is the use of her bed, not the act itself. She's not shaming him for masturbating but for doing it in her space without considering her feelings.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? She's the one providing the bed and has to deal with the consequences (washing sheets). Her feelings are valid. However, confronting a 15-year-old about this might be seen as harsh if the act itself isn't illegal or harmful. The cousin's response was dismissive and disrespectful, which adds to the problem.\n\nBut the author's approach\u2014telling the parents\u2014might be seen as overstepping. Maybe she should have talked to her cousin directly or involved the parents earlier. However, the parents might have a different perspective. The cousin's behavior could be a habit, and the author feels her boundaries are being ignored.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has the right to set boundaries in her space, but her method of addressing it could be questioned. However, considering she's a teenager herself, maybe her reaction is understandable. The key is whether her actions are proportionate. She's not condemning him but asking for respect in her space. The cousin's disrespectful reply is also a factor.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think the answer leans toward B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's setting boundaries in her personal space and dealing with a situation that affects her. However, her approach to reporting it to the parents might need careful consideration. But the question is specifically about whether she's in the wrong, not the best course of action. Her feelings are valid; she's not being a \"bitch\" for wanting respect in her space.\n"
