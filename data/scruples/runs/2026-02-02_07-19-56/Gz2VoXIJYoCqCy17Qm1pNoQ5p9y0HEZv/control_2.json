I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she feels he's being disrespectful by doing that in her bed, even though she doesn't care about the act itself. She's considering reporting this to her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are 15, so they're teenagers. In many places, masturbation is a private activity, but there are boundaries, especially when it comes to personal space and consent. The key points here are: the cousin was in the author's bed, the author didn't knock (though she mentions she forgot her charger), and the cousin didn't lock the door.\n\nThe author's main issue is that she doesn't want her bed used for that activity. She's not judging the act itself but the location and the respect for her space. The cousin's response was dismissive, which she finds disrespectful. The author wants to involve her aunt and uncle, but she's questioning if she's being too harsh.\n\nNow, thinking about boundaries and respect. Even though the cousin is a teenager and has autonomy over his body, the bed in question is the author's. Using someone else's bed for a private activity without their consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author has a legitimate concern about her personal space and the responsibility of cleaning. The cousin not locking the door might indicate he's unaware of the boundaries or doesn't consider others' feelings.\n\nHowever, the author did enter the room without knocking. While she had a reason (forgetting her charger), that could contribute to the situation. But she's not at fault for wanting to retrieve her belongings. The cousin's behavior in the bed is the main issue here.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, she's expressing her discomfort and setting boundaries. It's reasonable for her to ask him not to do that in her bed. The cousin's dismissive attitude and disrespect are problems. The author isn't being overly judgmental about the act itself, just the location and the respect involved.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her personal space and boundaries, which is appropriate. The cousin's behavior is the issue here, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
