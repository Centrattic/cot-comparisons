I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who's upset because her male cousin (also 15) is masturbating in her bed when he stays over. She caught him twice, and now she's considering reporting this to her aunt and uncle. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. Both are teenagers, so they're still in high school. The girl is using her bed while he's there, and she's okay with masturbation in general but not in her bed. She's upset because she feels disrespected and that she'll have to wash the sheets. \n\nFrom a privacy perspective, when someone is in another person's room without knocking, they might not be respecting the other person's privacy. But in this case, the girl walked into her room without knocking, which is a bit of a problem. Wait, the user says she walked in without knocking and caught him. So maybe the cousin wasn't locking the door, but she also didn't knock. That could be a factor. \n\nHowever, the main issue is the cousin masturbating in her bed. Even if she's okay with masturbation in general, the context is important. Her bed is her personal space, and she's the one who has to maintain it. The fact that she's the one washing the sheets adds to her frustration. \n\nBut is it her place to tell him not to do that in her bed? Since they're cousins and of similar age, maybe there's a power dynamic here. She might be overstepping, especially if he's doing something in a space he's temporarily using. On the other hand, her bed is her property, so she has a right to set boundaries about how it's used. \n\nThe cousin's response, telling her to \"piss off\" and that it's his body, suggests he's not respecting her boundaries. However, the girl's approach might have been confrontational, leading to the conflict. \n\nIf she's the one who walked in without knocking, maybe she's part of the problem. But she's also asserting her right to her own space. The key here is whether her actions were appropriate. She's trying to set a boundary about her bed, which is reasonable. However, how she communicated that might be an issue. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If the cousin is using her bed and she's okay with that, but just not the masturbation, she has a right to ask him to stop. However, if she's being overly controlling or not respecting his privacy in return, that could be a problem. \n\nGiven that the cousin is in their house visiting, maybe the parents should handle it. But the girl is considering reporting the disrespect. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess based on the situation.\n\nSo, the girl is standing up for her personal space, which is reasonable. The cousin's behavior is inappropriate in her bed, and she's trying to address it. The fact that she walked in without knocking might be a point against her, but the main issue is the cousin's actions. Therefore, she's not necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful. The key is whether her actions were justified in asserting her space, despite the cousin's actions.\n"
