It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 15-year-old girl, has her cousin staying over. Her male cousin, also 15, uses her bed, and she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. She walks in on him masturbating twice, and she's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed. She's considering reporting him to his parents but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals involved. Both are teenagers, so they're going through puberty, and masturbation is a natural part of that process. The author says she doesn't care about the act itself but is concerned about the location. She wants him to not do it in her bed. \n\nNow, the cousin was using her bed, which she gave him, and he wasn't locking the door. When she walked in the first time, she didn't say anything except to ask him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he dismissed her, leading her to get angry and consider telling his parents. \n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, even though it's a family setting, the cousin should understand that when someone is in a room, especially sharing someone else's bed, they should be considerate of others' comfort. Not locking the door when doing a private activity might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if others might walk in. However, the author did walk in without knocking, which could be a point against her. She had a key or access to her own room, so she chose not to knock, which could be seen as her fault for not being careful.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the sheets will be hers to wash, so she's uncomfortable with the idea of that. But that's a bit of a practical concern rather than a moral one. She's also upset about being disrespected when she told him to stop. He responded disrespectfully, which complicates things. \n\nHowever, the author is a teenager herself, and perhaps she's overstepping by trying to control another person's private behavior, even if it's in a shared space. The cousin is also a teenager, so he's within his rights to engage in private activities, provided he's not harming anyone. The author's approach might be seen as intrusive, especially if she didn't give him a chance to change his behavior after the first incident. She caught him twice, but maybe she should have addressed it more privately first, without involving parents unless it's necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's refusal to respect her request and being disrespectful is also an issue. The author is trying to set boundaries in her own space, which is valid. But she might not be the authority figure here, and perhaps she should have discussed it with the parents earlier.\n\nSo, there are two sides here. The author isn't in the wrong entirely because she's trying to protect her space and comfort, but she might be overreacting because she walked in without knocking and the cousin is also a teenager. The cousin's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's approach to confronting him and considering reporting him could be seen as harsh for someone her age. \n\nIn terms of privacy and respect, both should consider each other's needs. The author could have handled it more discreetly, maybe by talking to the parents first or finding another solution. However, the cousin's disrespectful response adds weight to her concern. \n\nI think the key point is whether the author had the authority to make that rule. Since it's her bed, she might feel entitled to set that boundary. But she's a teen too, so maybe she should have discussed it with her parents. The fact that she's considering reporting him might be overstepping, but she's also dealing with a peer's inconsiderate behavior.\n\nOverall, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she's setting boundaries in her own space, but she might have handled it in a way that's more confrontational than necessary. The cousin's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's approach could be seen as too aggressive for a peer relationship. So, maybe a mix of both. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Given that she walked in without knocking, maybe that's part of the issue. But her main point is about the bed being her responsibility to clean. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's trying to maintain her own space and hygiene, and the cousin was inconsiderate. However, the way she's handling it by reporting to parents might be a bit much, but the initial issue isn't her fault.\n"
