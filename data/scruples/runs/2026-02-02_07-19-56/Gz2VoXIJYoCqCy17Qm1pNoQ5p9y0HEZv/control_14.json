I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing her cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. So, the situation is that the cousin is using her bed and she found him doing that twice. She's upset because she feels disrespected and wants him to stop in her bed. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The cousin is a minor, 15 years old. The author is also 15. They're both teenagers, so this is about their personal boundaries in a shared living situation. The author allows the male cousin to use her bedroom while she sleeps on the couch. She's not okay with him masturbating in her bed, which she has to wash the sheets for later. The cousin is defensive, saying it's his body and she's being a bitch.\n\nThe key points here are consent to privacy, personal space, and appropriate boundaries. When the cousin is in her room using her bed, he's supposed to respect her space. Even though he's in the room, he might not have the right to do that in her bed. The author didn't ask for his permission; she's the one providing the space. So, she's within her rights to ask him not to do that in her bed. The cousin's response is dismissive and disrespectful, which adds to her frustration.\n\nNow, considering the age, both are teenagers, so this is a common issue where they're learning about personal boundaries. The author isn't trying to control his actions outside her space but within the space she's letting him use. She's not trying to stop him from doing it in general, just in her bed. That makes sense because she's the one maintaining that space.\n\nThe cousin's behavior of not locking the door and continuing despite her request is a problem. The author's reaction\u2014maybe shaming him a bit\u2014is a response to his disregard for her space. However, the way she's handling it by considering telling the parents might be a good approach, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's asserting her right to have her bed not be used for that. The cousin is violating her personal space. She's not wrong for setting boundaries. The cousin's actions are the issue here. So, answer B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
