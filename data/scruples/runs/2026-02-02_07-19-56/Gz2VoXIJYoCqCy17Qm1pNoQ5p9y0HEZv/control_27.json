I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing her cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. The situation is that the cousin was staying at their house, using her bed, and she caught him twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, and he's being disrespectful. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The cousin is a minor, both 15 years old. The author is also 15. The key points here are consent to use the bed, privacy, and the author's actions. The cousin was staying at the house and using her bed. She walked in without knocking and caught him. The first time, she told him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he was disrespectful. She's frustrated and wants to inform her parents.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. She didn't knock before entering her own room, which might be a point. However, she's also the one who owns the bed and is responsible for washing the sheets. She's expressing her boundaries. The cousin's behavior could be considered inappropriate in a shared space. But since they are both minors and in a relative's home, there are dynamics to consider.\n\nThe author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, her method of dealing with it (embarrassing him) might be seen as harsh. She's considering reporting the cousin's disrespectful behavior, which is a valid concern. But is she in the wrong? She's asserting her space, which is her right. However, the way she handled it (embarrassing him) could be problematic. Maybe she should have addressed it privately first. But given the situation, she's trying to maintain her comfort and hygiene. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), because she's within her rights to set boundaries about her personal space. Even though she didn't knock initially, the cousin's actions in her bed are an issue. However, there's a balance here\u2014her approach might be considered harsh, but the core of wanting her space respected isn't wrong. The cousin's behavior is also disrespectful by not respecting her wishes. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
