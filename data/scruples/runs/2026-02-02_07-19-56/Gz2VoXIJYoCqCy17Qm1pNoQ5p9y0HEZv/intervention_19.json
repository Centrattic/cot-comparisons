I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that the 15-year-old girl (the author) has her male cousin (also 15) staying over. She lets him use her bed while she sleeps on the couch. She walks in on him masturbating twice. The first time, she just asks him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he gets rude, says she's being a bitch, and she's considering telling his parents.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she doesn't care about the act itself but just wants it not done in her bed because she has to wash the sheets. The cousin is defensive and dismissive. The author is conflicted about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are 15, so minors. The author is a girl, the cousin is a boy. The setting is their home, and the author is allowing the cousin to use her bed. The main issue is the act of masturbation in her bed and the resulting conflict.\n\nMasturbation is a natural and private activity, especially for teenagers. However, the context matters. The cousin is using the author's bed, which she provides. She's not the one engaging in the act, but she's the one who has to deal with the aftermath (cleaning the sheets). The question is whether it's reasonable for her to ask him not to do it there, even though it's a private act.\n\nFrom a privacy and personal boundaries perspective, the author has the right to set boundaries about her own belongings and space. The bed is her property, and she's allowing someone else to use it. If the use of the bed in a certain way (masturbation) is against her comfort, she has the right to express that. However, some might argue that the cousin has the right to his privacy in the space provided by the host. But since it's her bed and her home, maybe she has more say.\n\nThe cousin's reaction is disrespectful, calling her a bitch and dismissing her request. That's clearly not okay. The author's response to this disrespect is to consider informing the parents, which is a reasonable step if the behavior is causing conflict and not being addressed.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for setting that boundary? Arguably, she's not. She's not judging the act itself but the location. It's about maintaining the cleanliness and appropriateness of her bed. Since she's the one who has to clean it, her request seems reasonable. However, the way she approached the situation might matter. The first time, she just asked him not to do it, which is appropriate. The second time, she got angry, which could be a reaction to his disrespect.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Is it reasonable to ask someone not to masturbate in your bed? 2) Was the author's reaction proportionate? 3) Did the cousin's behavior cross a line?\n\nMost people would agree that the author has the right to set that boundary. The cousin's disrespect is the main issue here, not the author's request. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for setting that boundary and reacting to the disrespectful response. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
