I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, and when he told her to mind her own business, she considered reporting him to her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both the author and her cousin are teenagers, so their understanding of boundaries and privacy might still be developing. The author is using her bed, and when she enters her room, she catches him. She's concerned about hygiene but also about the behavior in her space. \n\nThe author's main issue is that he's using her bed for something she's uncomfortable with, even though she says she doesn't care about the act itself. The problem is the location. She's the one who has to clean the sheets. But he's a teenager, and privacy can be tricky when family is visiting. Did she set clear boundaries beforehand? She did ask him not to do it in her bed, and he ignored her, leading to her getting angry.\n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong. She's not forbidding him from the activity itself, just the location. But she entered the room without knocking both times. That could be a privacy issue for him. However, it's his room when he's staying there? Wait, the setup is that when the cousins visit, the male cousin takes her bed and she sleeps on the couch. So the room is hers normally, but during visits, he's using it. So maybe she has a right to be in her own room. But entering without knocking might still be impolite, even if it's her room. If he's expecting privacy when using the bed, she might be infringing on that by walking in unannounced.\n\nBut he's in her space. The sheets are her responsibility. She's not trying to stop him from masturbating but from doing so in her bed. He's being disrespectful by ignoring her request. But the question is if she's in the wrong. If she didn't knock, that's a point against her. But she's in her own room. Maybe she's justified in wanting her own space and the cleanliness of her sheets. However, the way she handled it\u2014embarrassing him\u2014might come across as harsh. She could have set boundaries more clearly before the incidents. But given that he didn't respect her initial request, her reaction isn't entirely unreasonable. The key is whether she overstepped by reporting him. But the main question is if she's in the wrong. Considering all factors, I think the answer is B, No, she's not in the wrong. She's protecting her space and the practical aspect of the sheets. He's the one who didn't respect her boundary. The fact that she didn't knock is a minor point, but the main issue is his behavior in her bed.\n"
