I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 15-year-old girl who lets her cousin, another 15-year-old boy, sleep in her bed when their family visits. The author is sleeping on the couch with her female cousin. She walks into her room twice and catches her cousin masturbating. The first time, she doesn't care but tells him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he ignores her, and she gets angry, thinking he's being disrespectful. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle about this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are 15, so they're teenagers. Masturbation is a normal part of adolescent development, and it's common for teens to explore their bodies. The cousin is in his own home temporarily, as they're visiting. The author is using her room but not her bed the whole time since she's sleeping on the couch. \n\nWhen the author walks in on her cousin, she's in her own room. She didn't knock, which is a social norm to respect someone's privacy. However, she's in her own space, so maybe she's allowed to enter without knocking. But the cousin didn't lock the door, which might be his fault. \n\nThe author's main issue is that she doesn't want him to masturbate in her bed. She's responsible for washing the sheets, which seems to be a practical concern. She's not shaming him for the act itself but the location. The cousin responds disrespectfully, which is where the conflict arises. \n\nIs the author wrong to confront him? She's expressing her boundaries. It's reasonable to ask someone not to do something in your space that you're uncomfortable with, especially if you're cleaning up after. However, the method of confrontation\u2014embarrassing him\u2014might be problematic. Yelling or shaming someone in the moment isn't the best approach. \n\nThe author could have talked to him calmly after the fact. But she did confront him when she walked in, which might have been awkward. The cousin's response is also disrespectful, which the author is upset about. \n\nCalling the parents might be a step, but considering the cousin is only 15 and it's a privacy issue, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping. However, she's also protecting her own boundaries. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author has a valid concern about her space, but her approach might be confrontational. The cousin's behavior is normal, but he should respect her space. The author's reaction could be seen as justified in setting boundaries, but her method of confronting him might have been harsh. The key is whether her actions were respectful and appropriate. Since she's the one washing the sheets, she has a legitimate reason. But walking in without knocking and then getting angry might not be the best approach. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's setting a boundary, but her method could be improved. However, the cousin's behavior is also an issue since he didn't lock the door. Maybe both have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's expressing her discomfort and taking responsibility for the sheets, she's not entirely wrong. So the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
