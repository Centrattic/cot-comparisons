I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. The author is 15, and her male cousin is also 15. They stay at her house during visits, with the cousin using her bed while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin.\n\nFirst, the situation involves privacy and boundaries. The cousin is engaging in a private activity in a space where others are sleeping nearby. The author caught him twice, which led to conflict. The cousin dismissed her concerns, calling her a \"bitch\" and saying it's his body. The author is considering reporting this behavior to the parents.\n\nNow, considering age and context. Both are teenagers, so some level of curiosity and experimentation is natural. However, the key issue here is the setting. The cousin is using the author's bed, which is a shared space when others are staying over. The author has a legitimate concern about cleanliness and personal boundaries. Masturbating in a bed that others sleep in could lead to hygiene issues since the author will be washing the sheets. \n\nAlso, the cousin's response was disrespectful. Dismissing her feelings and calling her names isn't appropriate. The author is standing up for her space and the practical aspect of washing the sheets, which is a valid point. She's not judging the act itself but the location where it's happening. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for embarrassing him? It depends on how she did it. If she confronted him publicly or made him feel shamed unnecessarily, that could be problematic. However, the scenario mentions she caught him in the act and asked him not to do it again. When he continued and disrespected her, her concern is about her own boundaries and the shared living situation. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the cousin's behavior might not be illegal, but it's about respecting shared spaces. The author's reaction is about maintaining her space and addressing disrespect. Since the cousin didn't respect her boundaries, the author is justified in taking action, including informing the parents. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). She's asserting her right to privacy and cleanliness in her own space, especially when others are involved. The cousin's actions were disrespectful, and the author is within her rights to address it.\n"
