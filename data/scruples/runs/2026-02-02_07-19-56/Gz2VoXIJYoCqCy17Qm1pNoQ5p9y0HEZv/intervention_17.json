I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the 15-year-old girl (the author) caught her male cousin (also 15) masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, especially since she has to wash the sheets. He responded rudely, and she's considering telling his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals involved. Both are 15, so minors. The setting is their family home, and the cousin is using the author's bed. The key points here are about privacy, boundaries, and mutual respect.\n\nThe author didn't knock before entering, which led to her catching him. However, she had a legitimate reason (forgetting her charger). But she didn't knock, which could be seen as a privacy issue. On the other hand, the cousin didn't lock the door, which is his own responsibility. \n\nThe author is asserting her space when she uses her own bed. It's reasonable to expect that her bed isn't used for activities she's uncomfortable with, especially if she's the one who has to clean up. The cousin's behavior could be considered disrespectful, especially his dismissive and rude response. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. She's not forbidding him from the activity itself but the location. Since he's in her room, she has a right to set boundaries about her personal space. However, she did enter without knocking, which is a breach of privacy. But her reason was to retrieve her charger, which is a personal item. \n\nThe cousin's behavior might be typical for a teenager, but his response was disrespectful. The author is trying to set a boundary about her bed, which is part of her space. So, while she has some responsibility for not knocking, the cousin's actions in her bed without her consent (even if it's his room temporarily) could be seen as the main issue. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries about her personal space. The cousin's actions and attitude are more problematic. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
