I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice and now wants to talk to her aunt and uncle about his \"disrespectful behavior.\" The writer is conflicted about whether she's overreacting or justified.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The cousin is using her bed, and she found him in the act. She doesn't mind masturbation as a natural thing but doesn't want it in her bed, probably because of hygiene or personal space reasons. She mentions she's the one who has to wash the sheets, which implies she's concerned about cleanliness, even if she's not upset about the act itself. \n\nNow, from a privacy perspective, entering a room without knocking is generally considered rude. The cousin didn't lock the door, which could be an oversight, but the writer walked in without knocking. That's a key point. If she went into his room without knocking, that's a privacy violation. But in this case, it's her own room he's in. Wait, no, the male cousin is in her bed, and she walked into her room without knocking. So she's entering her own room, which he's occupying, and she's the one who didn't knock. That's something to consider. \n\nHer reaction was to embarrass him, which she did again when she caught him the second time. She got angry because she felt disrespected. The cousin responded by telling her to mind her own business and that she's being a \"bitch.\" The writer is now considering informing the parents (aunt and uncle) about this. \n\nSo the core issue here is about mutual respect and boundaries. The male cousin is using her bed and doing something private there, which she finds disrespectful. The female cousin is in her room, so she has a right to privacy and control over her space. However, the writer entered the room without knocking, which might be part of the problem. \n\nBut wait, the room in question is hers, right? She's letting him stay in her bed. So if it's her room, she might have the right to enter it. However, even in her own room, if someone is present, knocking is a courtesy. If he was in her room and she walked in without knocking, that's a breach of his privacy. On the other hand, if he's in a room that's supposed to be hers but he's staying there, maybe the expectations aren't clear. \n\nThe cousin's behavior is definitely inappropriate in her bed. It's not that he's doing something wrong in general, but doing it in her bed, which she uses and has to clean. She has a valid concern about the bed being a shared space. However, when she caught him the first time, she didn't confront him immediately. The second time, she got angry and decided to tell his parents. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's asserting her right to her space and the bed's cleanliness. On the other, she entered the room without knocking, which could be seen as invading his privacy. But the cousin was also violating her space by using her bed for something she's uncomfortable with. \n\nFrom a boundary standpoint, each has a right to their own space and privacy. Since it's her bed, she has a say over how it's used. The cousin's argument that it's his body and she can't control him is a bit off because the behavior in question is where it's done, not the act itself. So she has a right to ask him not to do it in her bed. \n\nHowever, the way she dealt with it might be problematic. Embarrassing him could be harsh, but she did mention she doesn't care about masturbation itself. Maybe she's trying to set a boundary without being overly judgmental. The cousin's dismissive and rude response is definitely his fault. \n\nThe writer is 15, so maybe she's still learning about handling such situations. The parents might need to be informed if he's not respecting her boundaries. But the writer did enter his room without knocking, which could be part of the issue. Wait, no, in the scenario, she's entering her own room where he is staying. So if the room is hers, she's allowed to enter, but maybe she should have knocked. \n\nBut the problem is that he was doing something private in her space. She's the one who owns the bed, so she's within her rights to ask for it to be used appropriately. The cousin's behavior is disrespectful because he's using her bed without considering her comfort. \n\nSo in terms of who is at fault, the cousin is in the wrong for not respecting her space, but the writer could have handled it better. However, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Since she's trying to set a boundary and the cousin is violating her space, the writer isn't in the wrong. But if she entered the room without knocking, that's a two-way street. \n\nWait, the user says that the writer lets the male cousin take her bed and she sleeps on the couch with the female cousin. So the room is hers, but the cousin is using her bed. The writer walked in without knocking, which is her room. So she's allowed to enter her own room, but not knocking is a privacy issue. However, the cousin was in her room. So the initial problem is that the cousin was in her space without her consent (since she's allowing him to stay there temporarily), but she still has the right to have that space respected. \n\nIn most cases, entering a room without knocking is considered impolite, especially if someone else is in there. However, if the room is hers and the cousin is staying there, maybe the expectations are different. But the cousin's actions are the main issue here. \n\nSo the writer's actions of confronting him and considering informing the parents are about setting boundaries. The cousin's response was rude and defensive, which might indicate a bigger problem. The writer's main concern is about the bed being used in a way she's uncomfortable with, which is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's asserting her right to her personal space and the cleanliness of her bed. The cousin's behavior is the issue here, not hers. The fact that she doesn't care about masturbation but about where it's done shows she's not being judgmental but is setting a boundary. The cousin's disrespect is the key problem.\n"
