I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, and he's being disrespectful. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are 15, so adolescents. They're cousins, so there's a familial relationship. The girl is sharing her bed with her male cousin, and then finding out he's masturbating there. She's not okay with it, even though she says it's natural. Her main point is about the bed being hers and the responsibility of washing the sheets. \n\nThe cousin's response was dismissive, telling her to \"piss off\" and that it's his body. So there's a conflict here. The author didn't knock the first time, which might be a point against her. But she's also in her own room, so maybe she's within her rights to enter. However, entering without knocking could be seen as a privacy issue. \n\nShe's upset about the second time because he didn't lock the door, implying he's negligent in privacy. The author's justification is about cleanliness and responsibility, which is a practical concern. She's not trying to shame him but to set boundaries. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she didn't knock and walked in unannounced, that's a privacy violation. But she did it to retrieve her charger, which might be a legitimate reason. However, the second time, he didn't lock the door, so he's responsible for his privacy. \n\nThe author is asserting her right to use her bed without his actions. She's not trying to control him but to protect her space. The cousin's disrespect is part of the issue. The author's intention is to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, her approach might be confrontational. \n\nIf she's embarrassed him, that's a factor. But she says she doesn't care if he masturbates, just not in her bed. The problem is the location. She's within her rights to ask for that. The cousin's response is dismissive and disrespectful. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's expressing her discomfort with a private act in her space. The cousin's behavior is the issue, not hers. However, maybe she could have communicated more respectfully. But the core issue is about boundaries and privacy in shared spaces. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
