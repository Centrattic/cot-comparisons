I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (15F) lets her male cousin (15M) use her bed while she sleeps on the couch. She catches him masturbating twice. The first time, she just tells him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he's dismissive and rude. The author is considering telling her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries, respect, and the appropriateness of the actions taken.\n\nAt 15, both teens are in a similar age group. The author is using her bed, and she's expressed her disapproval of the behavior in her space. The cousin is not respecting her boundary, and the author is upset about that. She's not trying to stop him from masturbating per se, just from doing it in her bed. That seems reasonable, as she's responsible for the cleanliness of the sheets. \n\nBut then, when he disrespects her, she's considering embarrassing him by telling their parents. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, setting boundaries in shared spaces is important. If someone is using your bed, they should respect your wishes about what's acceptable there. The cousin's behavior of ignoring her and being rude is clearly disrespectful, so the author's reaction might be justified as standing up for herself.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of how she's handling it. If she's planning to \"embarrass\" him by informing the parents, that could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's a private matter. But given that he was in her space and ignored her clearly stated boundaries, maybe she's justified in seeking parental intervention.\n\nThe initial part where she confronts him is okay. The issue comes when she decides to involve the parents. Depending on the cultural context and family norms, this might be seen as appropriate or harsh. If the cousin's behavior is a repeated disrespect and he's being rude, then telling the parents might be a reasonable step. But if the author is exaggerating the disrespect or not considering the cousin's privacy, then she might be in the wrong.\n\nBut the author's main issue is about her own space and the respect she's getting. The cousin was in her bed, and she's the one who has to deal with the consequences (washing the sheets). So, she's not wrong to be upset about that. However, the way she's handling it\u2014telling the parents to embarrass him\u2014could be seen as harsh. But if the cousin was truly being disrespectful, then maybe she's justified.\n\nIn the original question, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she's setting boundaries in her own space and trying to get respect. The cousin's behavior was disrespectful, so the author's response is a way to address that. However, the line between standing up for oneself and being vindictive is thin here. \n\nBut given that the author isn't trying to stop the cousin from masturbating, just from doing it in her bed, and the cousin is being rude, I think the author is not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
