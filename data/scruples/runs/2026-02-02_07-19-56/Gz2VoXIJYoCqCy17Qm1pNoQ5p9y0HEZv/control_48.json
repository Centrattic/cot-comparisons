I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 15-year-old girl, and her male cousin (also 15) is staying over. She lets him take her bed while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. She catches him masturbating in her bed twice. The first time, she just tells him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he ignores her, tells her to \"piss off,\" and she's considering telling her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Let's break it down.\n\nThe cousin is in the bed, which is the author's bed. She's given him the bed, but he's doing something private in a space that she's going to use\u2014so maybe she has a right to set boundaries about how her bed is used. Masturbation itself is a private act, but doing it in someone else's bed could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the bed is shared or will be used by others. She's concerned about washing the sheets, which is a practical issue. \n\nHowever, the cousin might feel that since he's in the bed, it's his space while staying there. But even so, public masturbation in a shared space is generally considered inappropriate. The author's reaction seems to be about setting a boundary regarding her own space and the responsibility of maintaining it. \n\nWhen she catches him the second time, he's dismissing her and being disrespectful. The author is frustrated because he's not respecting her wishes. She's not trying to control him (since she says she doesn't care about his actions in general) but about where he does them. \n\nCalling his parents might be a way to enforce the boundary if direct communication isn't working. But is that overstepping? At 15, they're both minors, so their parents are involved in their lives. The author's action of embarrassing him could be a reaction to his disrespect. But is embarrassing the right approach? Maybe not, but the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nThe main issue is the cousin's behavior in her bed without considering her feelings about the space. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is reasonable. The cousin's response is disrespectful, which justifies her wanting to involve the parents. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary and addressing disrespectful behavior. The cousin's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
