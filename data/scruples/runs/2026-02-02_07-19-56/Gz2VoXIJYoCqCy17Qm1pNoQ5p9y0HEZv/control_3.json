I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl catching her male cousin, also 15, masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that on her bed, and he's being disrespectful. She's considering telling his parents but isn't sure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The cousin is using her bed, which he might not have permission to do. She's the one who lets him take her bed and she sleeps on the couch. So maybe she's the one who set up the situation. But when she catches him, she's asking him not to do it. The problem is whether her reaction is justified.\n\nMasturbation is a natural and private act, especially for teenagers. However, doing it on someone else's bed without permission might cross a line. The author is concerned about the bed being used for that purpose and the responsibility of cleaning. The cousin is being disrespectful, according to the author. But is she in the wrong for being upset?\n\nLegally and socially, there's a difference between private behavior and public spaces. If someone is using her bed without her consent, then the act of masturbation in that space could be an issue. But the author allowed him to use the bed, so maybe she's partially responsible. However, she's also asserting her boundaries here. She wants him to respect her space, which is reasonable.\n\nThe cousin's argument is that it's his body and she has no say. But the bed is her property, so she has a right to set boundaries about its use. However, she's also a teenager, and maybe the situation is more about peer dynamics than strict ownership. The fact that she's the one who let him use the bed complicates things. She might be projecting her own discomfort or setting boundaries that weren't initially discussed.\n\nAnother angle is that the cousin is being disrespectful. If he's using her bed and doing something she's uncomfortable with, she has the right to express that. However, calling his parents could be a big step, especially if the initial setup was her allowing him to stay there. She might have created a situation where conflict is inevitable, making her part of the problem.\n\nAlso, the age of the individuals is 15, so they're both minors. Parents have a responsibility to address such behavior. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking this action. If she's asserting her right to private space, then she's not wrong. But if she's overstepping by not discussing the arrangement beforehand, maybe she's partially at fault.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally acceptable for teenagers to masturbate, but doing so in someone else's bed without their knowledge or consent is inappropriate. Since she allowed him to use the bed, maybe she should have set clearer boundaries from the start. Her reaction is about respecting her space, which is valid, but the initial use of the bed might have been her decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong because she's protecting her space and the cleanliness of her belongings. The cousin is using her bed without explicit permission for a private act, which she has the right to object to. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
