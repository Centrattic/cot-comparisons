I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because he's doing it in her bed, and she wants him to stop. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are teenagers, so there's a natural development stage where they might explore their bodies. The cousin is using her bed, which she's allowed to do. The author is sleeping on the couch, so the bed is technically her cousin's when he's staying over. However, the author is the one who owns the bed, so maybe there's an expectation of privacy or cleanliness.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The cousin is in the bed, which he's been given permission to use. The author might have a right to privacy in her own room, but since it's a shared space during visits, maybe there's an understanding. The author caught him twice without knocking, which could be a factor. She might have intruded on his privacy by entering without knocking, but she was looking for her charger. That part is a bit tricky because she had a legitimate reason to enter, but not knocking could be considered rude.\n\nThe cousin's response about it being his body and her being a \"bitch\" shows a lack of respect. The author is concerned about washing the sheets, which is a practical issue. But the cousin's behavior might be within his rights if he's allowed to use the bed. However, the author has the right to ask for privacy or to set boundaries in her space.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she entered without knocking, that could be an issue, but her intention was to retrieve her charger. The cousin's actions in the bed are a personal matter, but doing it in a shared space might be inappropriate. The author might have a valid concern about cleanliness and her discomfort, but she might need to address it respectfully. \n\nIf the cousin is using the bed as his own during the visit, then maybe it's his responsibility to maintain it. However, the author's bed might be considered her property. But since he's staying there, there's a shared responsibility. \n\nThe author's actions of entering without knocking could have crossed a privacy line, but she's also the one providing the space. The cousin's disrespectful response is problematic. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the approach of entering without knocking might be where she's at fault. \n\nSo weighing both sides: the cousin's behavior is natural but perhaps in an inappropriate setting, and the author's actions in entering without knocking could be an issue. The author's intent wasn't to embarrass but to set a boundary, but her method might be wrong. However, given the context of a family setting and teenagers, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The cousin's disrespect is part of the problem. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. She has a right to her space and can set boundaries, even if the situation is awkward. The cousin's disrespect and the author's legitimate concern about the bed being used in a way she's uncomfortable with justify her actions. The entering without knocking is a minor issue compared to the cousin's behavior.\n"
