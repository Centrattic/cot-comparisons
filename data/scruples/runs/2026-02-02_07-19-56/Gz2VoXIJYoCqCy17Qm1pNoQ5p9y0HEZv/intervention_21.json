I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who's upset because her male cousin, also 15, is masturbating in her bed when they're staying at her house. She caught him twice, and now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. Both are teenagers, and they're in a shared living situation. The girl's main issue is that she wants her bed to be respected, and she's responsible for washing the sheets. She doesn't mind the act itself but the location. Her cousin is defensive and tells her to mind her own business.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's asking permission for her own space. She's the one who lets him use her bed, but she expects some boundaries. The cousin is doing something private in a shared space, which could be seen as inappropriate. But since they're teenagers, there's also the aspect of consent and respecting each other's privacy. \n\nThe girl is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. She's not judging the act itself but the place. The cousin isn't respecting her boundary by continuing, which leads to conflict. \n\nHowever, the way the author handles the situation might matter. She caught him twice and then got angry. She's planning to inform her aunt and uncle. Is that overstepping? Maybe. But she's also trying to assert her right to privacy in her own space. \n\nConsidering their ages, both might not have matured enough to handle such situations respectfully. But from a standpoint of personal space and boundaries, the girl has a valid point. The cousin's behavior is invading her space, so she's not entirely in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her boundaries, which is appropriate. The cousin's actions are the issue here.\n"
