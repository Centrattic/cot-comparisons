I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. The author, a 15-year-old girl, lets her male cousin use her bed when he visits, and she sleeps on the couch. She caught him doing it twice, and the second time, she got angry and is considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The cousin is a minor, same age as the author, and the setting is a family home. The author is concerned about the sheets getting dirty, which is a practical issue. However, the cousin's behavior is private and perhaps not appropriate in a shared living space, even if it's legal for his age. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author overstepped. She didn't knock before entering the room, which is a common courtesy. But she was in her own room to get her charger. Her reaction of getting angry and considering informing the parents might be justified if she felt disrespected. However, the way she handled it\u2014embarrassing him\u2014could be problematic. \n\nMasturbation is a natural and age-appropriate activity for a teenager, but doing it in someone else's bed might be an issue of privacy and boundaries. The cousin not locking the door could be seen as a lack of discretion. But the author's approach to address it by calling the parents might be a way of enforcing boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is a teenager herself, and using the term \"bitch\" when confronting him might not be the best approach. Also, the cousin's response about it being his body and the author having no say could indicate tension in their relationship. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to be in the room without knocking? Is it reasonable to expect a guest not to masturbate in the host's bed? Is the author's reaction proportionate? \n\nI think the author is in a gray area. She's in her own room, so not necessarily wrong for entering, but she should have knocked. The cousin's behavior might be a privacy issue, but teenagers are entitled to some privacy. However, the author is concerned about the cleanliness of the sheets, which is a practical matter. Her reaction could be seen as trying to enforce her space, but the method (embarrassing him and considering tattling) might be where she's in the wrong. Maybe she should have talked to him privately first. \n\nBut the cousin's attitude is also a problem. Refusing to respect the author's feelings and calling her a \"bitch\" isn't right. So, perhaps both have some responsibility here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author is a minor, and the cousin's actions while in her bed might be a hygiene or boundary issue. The author's reaction of getting angry and considering informing the parents might be reasonable if the cousin was being disrespectful. \n\nWait, but the user initially said they don't care and just want him to not do it in her bed. So the author's primary issue is the use of her bed, not the act itself. The cousin's decision to use the bed for that might be a problem. The author is trying to set a boundary about her personal space. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), because she's setting a boundary about her bedroom. However, the way she did it by embarrassing him might not be the best approach. \n\nAlternatively, the cousin's actions are private, but as a guest, he might not be respecting the host's space. The author has the right to ask him to not use her bed in that way. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The issue is more about how she handled the situation. But the question is about whether she is in the wrong for embarrassing him. If the cousin was using her bed in a way she didn't consent to, then she's just asserting her boundaries. So the answer might be B.\n"
