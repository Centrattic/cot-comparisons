I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the 15-year-old girl catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, and she's considering telling her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both the author and her cousin are teenagers, and they're staying in the same house. She's letting her male cousin take her bed when her female cousin sleeps on the couch. That's a bit unusual, but maybe they have their own arrangement. Now, she walks in on him masturbating in her bed twice. She doesn't mind the act itself but is upset about it happening in her bed. She's concerned about washing the sheets, which adds a practical issue.\n\nMasturbation is a normal and private activity, but doing it in someone else's bed without considering their feelings might be crossing a line. The cousin's response of being disrespectful and telling her to \"piss off\" is problematic. The author's intention is to set boundaries about her personal space. Since she's the one using her bed and dealing with the aftermath (like washing sheets), her concern is valid. \n\nHowever, maybe the way she handles it matters. If she confronts him in a harsh way or embarrasses him publicly, that could be seen as wrong. But the scenario says she's considering telling her aunt and uncle, which might be an appropriate step if he's being disrespectful. The key here is whether her boundaries are reasonable. She's not trying to stop him from masturbating but from doing it in her bed, which is her space. \n\nThe cousin's behavior of not looking the door and continuing despite her initial request shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set those boundaries. She's protecting her personal space and dealing with the consequences of his actions. The problem isn't with her but with her cousin's disregard for her feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
