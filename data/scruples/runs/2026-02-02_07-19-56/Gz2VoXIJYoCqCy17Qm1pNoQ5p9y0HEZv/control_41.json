I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl (the author) who caught her male cousin (also 15) masturbating in her bed twice. The cousin was staying in her room, and she's upset because he's doing it in her bed. She wants to report his disrespectful behavior to his parents. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The cousin is using her bed, and she's not okay with him masturbating there. She's not against him doing it in general but the location. Her reasoning is that she'll be the one washing the sheets. She's considering telling his parents. The user is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: age, privacy, respect for personal space, boundaries. Both are teenagers, so they're minors. The cousin is using her bed without locking the door, leading to the author catching him. She's upset because she feels disrespected. The cousin responded dismissively, saying she's being a bitch.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she's trying to set boundaries about her personal space. It's reasonable to ask someone not to do something in her bed. Masturbation isn't inherently wrong, but doing it in someone else's bed without considering their comfort is an issue of personal boundaries. The cousin, on the other hand, is being disrespectful by not respecting her wishes. The author's intention is to maintain her space, not to judge his actions.\n\nHowever, the author did walk into the room without knocking. But she had a valid reason (getting her charger). Still, she could have knocked, but maybe she forgot. The fact that he didn't lock the door might mean he wasn't expecting privacy. But the author is asserting her right to have her bed respected. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's setting reasonable boundaries. The cousin's behavior is the issue here for not respecting her wishes. So the answer should be B.\n"
