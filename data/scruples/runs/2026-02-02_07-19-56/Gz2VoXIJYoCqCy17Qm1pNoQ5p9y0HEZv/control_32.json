I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She tells him not to do it in her bed, he responds disrespectfully, and she's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals involved. Both the author and her cousin are 15, which is a minor. In many places, minors have their own bedrooms and privacy rights, but since they're staying in someone else's house, the rules might be different. The author is using her bed when her cousin is there. She has a right to privacy in her own room, but she also let him use her bed. However, she walked in without knocking both times, which might be an issue. \n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. Did she knock? The user mentioned she walked in without knocking both times. That's a problem because entering someone's room without permission is a privacy violation. Even if it's her room, if she's allowing her cousin to stay there, the cousin might expect some privacy. But she's the one who's using the room, so maybe she expects that when she goes in, he's not doing something private. \n\nBut the cousin is a minor, and masturbation is a normal, private activity. The author is upset because she's the one washing the sheets, which is a practical concern. But she's also angry about the disrespect. However, her approach might be confrontational. She called him a \"bitch\" and he responded disrespectfully. \n\nThe author's actions: entering without knocking, confronting him, and considering telling her aunt and uncle. The cousin's actions: masturbating in the bed where the author is staying, not locking the door. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She didn't knock, which is a breach of privacy. If she wants him to not do it in her bed, maybe she should have knocked first. But she's also the one who allows him to stay in her bed, so perhaps she should have considered that. The author's right to privacy in her own room might conflict with her cousin's privacy when he's using the room. \n\nThere's also the aspect of respect. The cousin's response was rude, but the author's initial action of walking in without knocking might have contributed to the situation. So maybe both have some fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she entered without knocking, that's a privacy violation. If she then confronts him harshly, that's another issue. \n\nIn some contexts, minors might not be as aware of these norms, but 15 is old enough to understand privacy. The author might be right in wanting to set boundaries, but her method could be problematic. However, the cousin's behavior is also about a private act that could be done elsewhere. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's main wrongdoing might be not knocking, leading to the confrontation. So she could be in the wrong for violating his privacy. But if she's using her own bed and expects that when she enters, he's not doing that, maybe it's a misunderstanding. The answer is tricky, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for not knocking and then escalating the situation.\n"
