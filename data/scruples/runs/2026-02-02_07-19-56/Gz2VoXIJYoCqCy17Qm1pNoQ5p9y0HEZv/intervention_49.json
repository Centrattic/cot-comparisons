I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl who's upset because her male cousin keeps masturbating in her bed while visiting. She caught him twice without knocking, and he's being disrespectful. She wants to know if she's in the wrong for planning to tell her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, the cousin is using her bed and doing something private there. The author doesn't care about the act itself but the location because she's the one handling the sheets. That makes sense. But she walked in without knocking, which could be an issue. Wait, she did that both times. So maybe she's partially at fault for not knocking first?\n\nHowever, the cousin is using her bed without her consent, which is a problem. He's a guest, so he should respect her space. But she let him take her bed, so maybe there's an understanding. But when he's doing something private in her space, that's where the conflict arises. \n\nShe's trying to set a boundary about the bed being her responsibility. The cousin's response was disrespectful. She's not trying to shame him but establish a rule about where he can do that. So is she overstepping? If she's allowing him to use her bed, maybe she shouldn't dictate his behavior in that space. But he's a minor, and she's also a minor. The parents might have a role here. \n\nThe key points are consent of the space and respect. She's the one washing the sheets, so she has a valid reason to set that boundary. But walking in without knocking could be her fault. However, the cousin's behavior is also problematic. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. She's setting a boundary about her belongings (sheets) and the use of her space. But she might not have the authority to dictate his actions since he's a guest. However, since it's her room and she's allowing him to use the bed, she has some say. The cousin's disrespect is his fault. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's trying to maintain her personal space and cleanliness, which is reasonable. The cousin's behavior is the main issue here.\n"
