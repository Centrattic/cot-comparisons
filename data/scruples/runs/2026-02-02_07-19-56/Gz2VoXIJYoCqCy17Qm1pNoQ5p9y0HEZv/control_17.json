I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl who's upset because her male cousin keeps masturbating in her bed while staying over. She caught him twice, and now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to address this.\n\nFirst, the cousin is also 15, so both are teenagers. The user is using her bed, but when the cousin is there, he takes her bed, and she sleeps on the couch. The cousin isn't locking the door, which leads to the user catching him. She's not upset about the masturbation itself but about it happening in her bed. She argues that she'll be the one washing the sheets, implying a hygiene or cleanliness issue. The cousin responded disrespectfully, saying it's his body and she's being a bitch.\n\nNow, considering the context: the user's main issue is the location of the activity, not the act itself. She's trying to set boundaries about her personal space. The cousin is in her room, using her bed, and not respecting her privacy by not locking the door. The user's intention isn't to embarrass him but to set a boundary. However, she did catch him and got angry, which led to conflict.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's advocating for her own space and cleanliness. It's reasonable to ask someone not to do something in her bed. The cousin's behavior could be seen as disrespectful, especially since he's in her space without consent. However, the way she's handling it\u2014by embarrassing him or considering informing his parents\u2014might be where the issue could be. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong for the situation itself.\n\nThe key points are: her bed is her personal space, the cousin is using it without her consent for an activity she's uncomfortable with being associated with her space, and she's trying to address it respectfully (since she doesn't care about the act itself, just the location). The cousin's response is disrespectful and dismissive. \n\nSo, she's not in the wrong for wanting to address the use of her bed. The answer should be B (No).\n"
