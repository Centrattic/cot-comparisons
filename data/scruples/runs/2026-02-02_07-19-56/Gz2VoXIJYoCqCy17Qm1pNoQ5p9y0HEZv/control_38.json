I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 15-year-old girl who sometimes hosts her cousins. When they visit, her male cousin (also 15) stays in her bed while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. She caught her cousin masturbating in her bed twice. The first time, she just told him not to do it in her bed. The second time, she got angry because she felt disrespected. The cousin responded by calling her a bitch and dismissing her concerns. Now, the author is considering telling her aunt and uncle but wants to know if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both the author and her cousin are teenagers. Their parents might be away when the cousins visit. The author is sharing her bed with her cousin, which could be a bit awkward. She's not upset about the masturbation itself but about it happening in her bed, which she uses and has to maintain. She's responsible for washing the sheets, so she's concerned about hygiene and respecting her space.\n\nThe cousin's response was dismissive and disrespectful. The author's reaction is about setting boundaries regarding her personal space. She's not judging the act itself but the location. The key point here is consent and respect for personal space. The author is using her bed, so the cousin shouldn't be using it for activities that she's uncomfortable with. Additionally, the cousin not locking the door led to the situation, which is a safety issue as well.\n\nThe author's intention isn't to shame him for masturbating but to enforce that her bed is her space. Her anger comes from feeling disrespected and having to deal with the consequences (washing the sheets). The cousin's response was rude, so the author is justified in feeling upset. Telling her parents might be a way to address the disrespectful behavior, especially since they are minors and the parents are responsible for their upbringing.\n\nHowever, the author's approach of embarrassing her cousin could be problematic. Instead of confronting him respectfully first, she might have reacted with embarrassment, which could escalate tensions. But given the scenario, she did ask him not to do it in her bed, and he ignored her, leading to her anger. The key here is whether the author acted in a way that's reasonable for a 15-year-old dealing with a peer in a shared space. She's not in the wrong because she's protecting her space and addressing disrespect. The cousin's behavior is the issue, not her response to it.\n"
