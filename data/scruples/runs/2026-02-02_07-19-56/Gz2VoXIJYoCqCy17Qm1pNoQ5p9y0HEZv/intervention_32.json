I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a 15-year-old girl whose male cousin visits and uses her bed. She walked in on him masturbating twice, which she didn't like because it's her bed and she has to wash the sheets. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. Both the author and her cousin are 15, which is a minor age. In many places, teenagers are still learning about boundaries and privacy. The cousin was in the room, which might be a shared space during visits. The author is upset because he's using her bed and doing something private there. She's not upset about the masturbation itself but the fact that it's in her bed. She's concerned about the cleanliness and the respect for her space.\n\nNow, the cousin's response was dismissive, saying it's his body and she's being a bitch. That's disrespectful, but the author is trying to set a boundary. The question is whether she's overstepping by wanting to inform her aunt and uncle.\n\nThe author isn't forbidding him from masturbating but the location. It's reasonable to ask someone not to do that in a shared space, especially if it's her bed. However, maybe she should have discussed it more calmly first. But given that it happened twice, and he was dismissive, maybe her reaction is justified. \n\nThe part about washing the sheets is practical. She's not objecting to the act itself but the mess or potential uncleanliness. However, teenagers might not consider that from each other's perspectives. \n\nIs she being a \"bitch\" for setting boundaries? If she's the one providing the bed, she has a right to set some rules about its use. The cousin's behavior is invading her space without considering her comfort. The author's intention is to protect her own space and the cleanliness of her belongings, which is reasonable. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way to handle it. She could have talked to her parents or the parents first before involving the aunt and uncle. However, the question is about her being in the wrong. Since she's trying to maintain boundaries and the cousin was disrespectful, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
