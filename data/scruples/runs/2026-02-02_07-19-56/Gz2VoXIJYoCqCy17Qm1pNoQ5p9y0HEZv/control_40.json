I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl who's dealing with her cousin, also 15, staying in her bed. She caught him masturbating twice, and now she's upset because she doesn't want that happening in her bed. She's thinking of telling her aunt and uncle but isn't sure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The cousin is a minor, so any discussion about masturbation involves minors and their boundaries. The girl is expressing her discomfort about her own space being used in a way she's not okay with. She's not shaming him for the act itself but the location\u2014her bed. She's responsible for washing the sheets, which adds a practical concern.\n\nBut here's the catch: both are teenagers, and the cousin is using the bed when it's supposed to be the girl's. Even if the girl is allowing him to use her bed, there's an implicit understanding of mutual respect for each other's privacy and space. The cousin's behavior of not locking the door and continuing despite being asked could be seen as disrespectful. However, the girl's response might be seen as enforcing boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nBut wait, she's a minor too. How does that affect the situation? In some contexts, minors are expected to have some level of privacy, but when it's within a family setting and involving siblings or cousins, the lines can get blurry. The girl's actions might be seen as overstepping if she's not supposed to dictate how someone else uses their body, even in shared spaces. However, she's also asserting her ownership of her bed and the responsibility of cleaning, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect, the appropriateness of the situation given their ages, and whether informing the parents is necessary. If the cousin is being disrespectful by not considering her comfort and the cleanliness, then the girl has a right to address it. However, escalating to the parents might be appropriate if there's a pattern of disrespect.\n\nBut is the girl in the wrong? If she's using her own bed and the cousin is using it when she's not there, but then he's not respecting her space by not locking the door and continuing the activity, she's not wrong in wanting to set boundaries. However, since he's a minor, and she's also a minor, maybe the parents should have addressed the sleeping arrangements to prevent such situations. The girl might be right in her stance but perhaps could have handled it differently, like talking to her parents first instead of confronting him directly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the girl isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's trying to maintain her personal space and cleanliness. The cousin's actions are the problem here. But maybe she could have approached it more maturely. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer is B, No.\n"
