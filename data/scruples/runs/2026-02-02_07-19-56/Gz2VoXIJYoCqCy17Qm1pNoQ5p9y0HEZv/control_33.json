I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl who's dealing with her 15-year-old male cousin. The situation is about her finding him masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because he's using her bed for that, and she wants him to stop. She's considering reporting this to her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are privacy, personal space, and the appropriateness of the cousin's actions. \n\nWhen she first catches him, she doesn't knock. That's a point against her because entering someone's room without permission is generally considered rude and invasive. However, she was looking for her charger, which might be a legitimate reason, but it's still important to knock. \n\nThen, she catches him again. He's not locking the door, which is his responsibility. She's upset because he's using her bed for masturbation, which she finds disrespectful. Even though she says she doesn't care about the act itself, the location is an issue because she's the one who has to clean up. \n\nThe cousin responds by being dismissive and rude, calling her a bitch. His behavior is disrespectful, but the question is whether the author's actions are justified. \n\nHer intention is to protect her personal space and the cleanliness of her belongings. From a privacy standpoint, even though they're family, there's an expectation that one's room is a private space. Allowing others to use it for activities that might lead to mess or discomfort isn't reasonable. \n\nHowever, the initial act of entering the room without knocking is a mistake. But given that he wasn't locking the door, maybe she's not entirely at fault. It's a bit of a two-way situation. \n\nConsidering the cultural context, talking to the parents might be necessary because the cousin's behavior is inappropriate in a shared space. The author isn't trying to police his actions but to maintain her boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries, especially regarding her own space and the maintenance of her belongings. The cousin's actions in using her bed without regard for her feelings is the main issue here. The fact that she's not shaming him for the act itself but the location shows she's focused on respect. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
