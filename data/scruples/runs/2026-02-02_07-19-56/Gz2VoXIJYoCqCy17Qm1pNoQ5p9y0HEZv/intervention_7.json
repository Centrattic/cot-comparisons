I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl who's upset because her male cousin keeps masturbating in her bed while staying at her house. She's caught him twice and is considering telling her aunt and uncle. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the cousin is 15, so both are teenagers. The user allows her male cousin to take her bed and she sleeps on the couch with the female cousin. The first time, she walks in without knocking and catches him. She doesn't care about the act itself but objects to it being done in her bed. The second time, she's more upset because he didn't lock the door, leading to her feeling disrespected. He responded disrespectfully, calling her a bitch. She wants to inform her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering privacy and boundaries. At 15, both are in a phase where they might be exploring their bodies. However, the act of masturbating in someone else's bed, especially a relative's, could be seen as inappropriate. The user is concerned about the sheets and the shared space, which is a practical issue. The cousin's behavior might be considered disrespectful if he's not respecting the user's boundaries by not locking the door. The user's reaction is to set a boundary by telling him not to do it in her bed. Since he continued and was disrespectful, she's within her rights to express her discomfort. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of how she's handling it. She's considering exposing his behavior to their parents, which might be seen as tattling, but given his disrespect and the repeated violation of her space, it could be justified. The user isn't condemning the act itself but the context. So, is she in the wrong? If she's clearly communicated her boundaries and he's ignored them, she's not in the wrong. However, the act of catching him in the act and then escalating it to parents might be seen as harsh, but considering his response, she's protecting her own space. \n\nOn the other hand, the cousin's behavior\u2014masturbating in someone else's bed and being disrespectful\u2014could be the main issue. The user's intention is to set boundaries, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
