I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the 15-year-old girl (the author) has her cousins visiting. The male cousin is staying in her room, using her bed, while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. She caught him masturbating in her bed twice. She told him not to do it in her bed, but he didn't listen and was rude. Now she's thinking of telling his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. Both are teenagers, so they're at an age where they might be exploring their bodies. But the key issue here is the setting. The author is using her bed, and he's using it without her permission. She's okay with the act itself but not the location. She's concerned about the sheets and the disrespect.\n\nIs it wrong to ask someone not to masturbate in a space that's not theirs? If someone is using your belongings or space, it's reasonable to set boundaries. For example, if a friend used your car and made a mess, you'd ask them to clean it. So, asking him not to do it in her bed seems fair. \n\nBut then, when he was disrespectful, the author might have felt justified in wanting to tell his parents. However, did she handle it appropriately? She caught him twice, confronted him, and he responded rudely. She's considering involving the parents, which is a step that might be necessary if there's a pattern of disrespect. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? The act of setting boundaries isn't wrong. The question is whether her actions in reporting it are justified. The key points are consent of the space and respect. He was in her room using her bed without her permission? Wait, actually, the first part says the author lets her male cousin take her bed. So, maybe she gave him permission to use the bed. But does that imply permission for all activities in the bed? Probably not. If someone uses your space, you can set boundaries on how it's used. So, even if she allowed him to sleep there, she can ask him not to masturbate in it. \n\nHe didn't lock the door, which is his responsibility. But the author's right to privacy and her belongings is important. So, she's not in the wrong for wanting to set that boundary. The cousin's disrespectful behavior is the issue, but the author's response of confronting him and considering reporting it might be appropriate. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Like talking to her parents first or discussing it with the cousin's parents in a more respectful way. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's standing up for her space and not allowing misuse of her belongings, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
