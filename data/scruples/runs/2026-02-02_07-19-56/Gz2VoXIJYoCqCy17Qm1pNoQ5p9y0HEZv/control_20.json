I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she feels disrespected and wants him to stop using her bed for that. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the individuals. Both are 15, which is a minor age. Privacy and boundaries in such situations can be tricky. The girl is using her bed, and when her cousin is using it, he's doing something private. She walked in without knocking both times, which might be a point. But even if she didn't knock, the cousin not locking the door could be his responsibility.\n\nThe girl's main issue is that she's the one who has to wash the sheets. She doesn't care about the act itself but the use of her bed. She confronts him, but he dismisses her. The key points here are about personal boundaries and respect. Even if the cousin is using the bed, the girl has a right to set boundaries regarding her personal space. Masturbating in someone else's bed might be considered inappropriate by many, especially if it's not their own bed.\n\nHowever, the girl did enter without knocking, which might be seen as invading his privacy. But she's also the owner of the room and the bed, so maybe she has a right to set rules there. The cousin's response is disrespectful, which is a problem. The girl's intention isn't to shame him but to maintain her own boundaries. She's not trying to control his body but the use of her possessions.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's about balancing privacy and respect. If the cousin is in a guest room, perhaps he should have used his own space for such activities. The girl's request is reasonable if the bed is her personal property. The main issue is the cousin's lack of respect for her boundaries, not the girl's actions. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
