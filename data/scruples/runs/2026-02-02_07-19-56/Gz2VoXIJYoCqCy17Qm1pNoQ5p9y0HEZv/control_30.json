I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She told him not to do it in her bed, but he ignored her and was disrespectful. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. Both the author and her cousin are teenagers, so their understanding of boundaries might still be developing. The author is using her bed, which is her personal space, and she's upset because she has to wash the sheets. The cousin is in a shared living situation, maybe during a visit. \n\nMasturbation is a natural and private activity, but doing it in someone else's bed without considering their feelings could be an issue. The cousin's reaction was disrespectful, which is a key point. The author isn't shaming him for the act itself but for the location and the lack of respect towards her.\n\nThe author's main concern is about personal space and boundaries. She's not trying to police his behavior but is setting a boundary about her own belongings. The cousin's disregard for her request and his disrespectful response might justify her feeling upset. \n\nHowever, the author's approach\u2014possibly going to her aunt and uncle\u2014might be seen as overstepping, depending on how she presents it. If she's framing it as the cousin's disrespectful behavior rather than judging his actions, then it might be reasonable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's asserting her right to her personal space and expressing her discomfort. The cousin's actions and response were the main issues. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
