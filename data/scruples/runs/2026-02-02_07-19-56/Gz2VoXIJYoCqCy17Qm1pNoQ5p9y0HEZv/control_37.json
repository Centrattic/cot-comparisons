I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (15f) is in the wrong for embarrassing her cousin (15m) after catching him masturbating in her bed twice. The situation involves her cousins staying at her house, with the male cousin using her bed. \n\nFirst, the author walks in without knocking and catches him the first time. She doesn't care but tells him not to do it in her bed. He ignores her advice the second time when she walks in again. She gets upset, calls her aunt and uncle, and now is questioning if she's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the age of the individuals, both are 15, which is a time when puberty is happening. Masturbation is a natural part of development, but the context here is that he's doing it in her bed. The author is concerned about the practical aspect of washing the sheets and the respect issue. She's asserting her boundaries by not wanting him to use her bed for that, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe cousin's response that he's \"being a bitch\" and the author's reaction of getting angry and wanting to inform the parents\u2014does she have a right to set this boundary? Since it's her bed, she has the right to privacy and to set rules about its use. Even if he's using it by default because the family is staying over, she's the one responsible for the maintenance (washing sheets), which adds a practical incentive to avoid such behavior.\n\nHowever, she did walk in without knocking the first time, which is a valid point. But the second time, he didn't lock the door, so she had a right to enter her room. Her actions in embarrassing him might be seen as overstepping, but given the repeated behavior and the context of her bed, it's about her personal space and cleanliness.\n\nThe key factors here are the repeated actions of the cousin despite being asked, the author's ownership of the bed and sheets, and her right to set boundaries. The cousin's disrespect and the parent's potential reaction to his behavior also play a role. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary and taking action to protect her space.\n"
