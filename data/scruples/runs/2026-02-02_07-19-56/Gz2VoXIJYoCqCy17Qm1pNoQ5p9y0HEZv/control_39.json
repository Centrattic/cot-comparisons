I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that in her bed, and he's being disrespectful. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle but wants to know if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The cousin is staying in her room, using her bed. She's found him masturbating both times. She doesn't mind the act itself but the location. She's 15, same age as the cousin. The key points here are privacy, boundaries, and respect.\n\nWhen she walked into the room without knocking, that's one thing. But she might have a right to privacy in her own room, especially when guests are staying. However, she allowed him to use her bed while she slept on the couch. So maybe there's an understanding that the room is being shared. But masturbation in someone else's bed could be an issue, especially since she's the one who has to clean it. \n\nThe cousin's response was dismissive and disrespectful, which is a problem. She's trying to set a boundary about the bed, which is reasonable. She's not saying he can't masturbate, just not in her bed. The uncle and aunt's responsibility comes into play if the cousin is being disrespectful and not respecting her space.\n\nBut wait, is she in the wrong for not knocking? The first time she walked in without knocking, which led to her catching him. However, she was getting her charger, so maybe she has a legitimate reason. But she should knock when entering someone else's room, even if it's her own. The second time, maybe she knocked but he didn't answer? Or she didn't knock again?\n\nAlso, considering their age, they're teenagers, and this is a common issue with privacy. The girl is setting boundaries about her personal space, which is important. The cousin's behavior is disrespectful, and she's trying to address it. \n\nIs she being a \"bitch\" as he accused? Probably not. She's asserting her right to privacy and cleanliness. The fact that she's willing to involve the parents might be necessary if he's not respecting her.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting boundaries in her own space. The cousin's actions are the issue, and she's trying to address them appropriately. Answer B.\n"
