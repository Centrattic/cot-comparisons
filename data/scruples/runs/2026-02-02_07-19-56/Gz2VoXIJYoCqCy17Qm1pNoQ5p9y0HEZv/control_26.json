I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in her bed. The author is 15 and so is her cousin. They're staying at the author's house, and the male cousin is using her bed while she sleeps on the couch. The cousin was masturbating in her bed twice, and the author confronted him, leading to an argument. The author is considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. Both are minors, and the cousin is in a private space (the author's room and bed) engaging in a personal activity. The author is upset because she has to wash the sheets, which might be more about cleanliness than the act itself. But there's also the issue of consent and respect for personal space. The cousin was in her room without locking the door, which is important because entering a room without permission is a privacy issue. \n\nThe author isn't trying to shame him for the act itself but rather the location. However, when she caught him and was upset, she might have overreacted by embarrassing him. The cousin's response was disrespectful, but the author's actions could also be seen as overstepping, especially since she's the same age and the situation is between minors. The key points are privacy, respect, and appropriate boundaries. \n\nIf the author used harsh words or public embarrassment, that's a problem. But if she calmly asked him not to do it in her bed, that's reasonable. The article mentions she got \"pissed off\" and considered calling her aunt and uncle. The cousin's behavior was disrespectful, but the author's response could have been more constructive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the cousin is in the wrong for invading her space and being disrespectful. The author's intent was to set a boundary, which is valid. However, the method of confronting him (embarrassing him) might not be the best approach. But given the circumstances, her concern about privacy and cleanliness is understandable. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but her reaction could be improved. The main issue is the cousin's behavior, not the author's desire to protect her space.\n"
