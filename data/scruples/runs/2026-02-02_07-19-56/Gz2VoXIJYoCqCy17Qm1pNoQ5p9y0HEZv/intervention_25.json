I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 15-year-old girl who caught her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she feels disrespected and wants him to stop. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The cousin is 15, same age as the author. They're staying in the house, and the girl lets the boy take her bed while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. So the first time, she walks in without knocking and catches him. She doesn't care but asks him to not do it in her bed. Then the second time, he's doing it again, not locking the door, and she gets angry. He responds disrespectfully. She wants to inform her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nThe author's perspective is that she's not okay with him masturbating in her bed because she has to wash the sheets. The cousin argues it's his body and she's being a bitch. So, the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a privacy and consent angle, the girl's bed is her personal space. Even though he's staying there temporarily, using her bed for personal activities without consideration might be an issue. But the girl didn't knock, which could be a point against her. However, she's in her own home, so maybe she expects some privacy when she's in her room. The second time he didn't lock the door, which is his responsibility. She's upset because she has to deal with the consequences (washing sheets), but he's a guest. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting others' privacy and personal boundaries. The girl is trying to set a boundary, which is reasonable. The cousin's dismissive and disrespectful attitude is problematic. However, the girl's approach in confronting him might be seen as harsh, especially if she's making a big deal about it. But she's also the one who has to live with the situation. \n\nConsidering their ages, both are teenagers, so maturity levels might affect how they handle the situation. The girl's intentions are to maintain hygiene and personal space, which are valid. The cousin's actions are natural but not respecting her space. The girl's reaction could be seen as justified in setting a boundary, but her method (embarrassing him) might not be the best approach. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong overall. \n\nI think the key here is that the girl is trying to set a boundary in her own space, which is her right. The cousin's actions are inappropriate in her space. The girl isn't in the wrong for wanting him to respect her bed. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
