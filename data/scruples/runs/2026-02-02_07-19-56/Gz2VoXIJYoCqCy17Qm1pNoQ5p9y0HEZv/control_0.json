I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him doing that there, especially since she's the one who has to wash the sheets. The cousin responds disrespectfully, saying she's being a bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and boundaries. The cousin is using her bed without her consent. Even though masturbation is a natural activity, doing it in someone else's bed without them being there might be an invasion of privacy. The author has a right to her own space. She's not trying to stop him from masturbating, just where he does it. \n\nThe cousin's reaction is disrespectful, which adds to the problem. The author isn't being malicious; she's setting a boundary about her personal space. She's the one who has to clean up, so it's practical as well as personal. \n\nOn the other hand, the cousin is a minor, and the situation is between family members. The author is also a minor, so the context is different from adults. However, she's asserting her right to her space. The key point is whether she's overstepping. Since she's not criticizing the act itself but the location, and given that it's her bed, she's within her rights to ask him not to do it there. The cousin's argument that it's his body doesn't apply here because the location is her space. \n\nAlso, the author is considering involving the parents, which might be necessary if the behavior continues and the cousin is disrespectful. But the initial act of setting a boundary isn't wrong. So, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
