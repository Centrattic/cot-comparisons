I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The scenario is about a 15-year-old girl who's upset because her male cousin keeps masturbating in her bed when visiting. She caught him twice and now wants to tell their parents.\n\nFirst, the cousin is using her bed while she sleeps on the couch. The author doesn't mind masturbation in general but objects to it happening in her bed. She's concerned about washing the sheets herself. She confronted him, he got defensive, and she's thinking of telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, she's sharing her personal space. She might feel that using her bed for that activity is inappropriate, especially since she's the one who has to clean up. But the cousin is a minor, and masturbation is a natural part of puberty. The author isn't his parent, so maybe she overstepped by entering the room without knocking again and confronting him publicly, which could be embarrassing.\n\nBut then again, she owns the space? Wait, she's a minor too. Maybe she's not the owner but the one using the bed. The situation is in her home, but it's her parents' house. She's allowing her cousin to use her bed, but there might be an unspoken agreement about privacy. However, entering the room without knocking is a privacy issue. She did that once before, caught him, and then a second time. Maybe she's violating his privacy by walking in unannounced.\n\nThe cousin's response was dismissive and disrespectful, which is part of the problem. The author's reaction\u2014embarrassing him, maybe making a public scene\u2014could be seen as harsh. But she's also a teenager, and this is a common issue in families. The question is whether her actions are justified.\n\nThe key points: She didn't knock, which is a privacy violation. She's entering his personal space uninvited. Even if she owns the bed, he's using it under the parents' permission. Her actions could be seen as intrusive. However, she's upset about the hygiene and maybe the use of her belongings. \n\nOn the other hand, she's a teenager dealing with a cousin she's responsible for hosting. She might feel entitled to her space. But the way she handled it\u2014embarrassing him\u2014might be the problem. Instead of confronting him, maybe she should have talked to her parents first.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She violated his privacy by entering without knocking, which is a big deal. Even if she's upset, that action is a privacy breach. Then, embarrassing him publicly after catching him\u2014that's another issue. So, yes, she might be in the wrong for the initial invasion of privacy and the subsequent shaming. \n\nBut some might argue that she has a right to her space and the bed she owns. However, since it's a family home and he's a guest, maybe she should have discussed it with her parents instead of confronting him directly. Her approach was perhaps inappropriate, so she's at fault here.\n"
