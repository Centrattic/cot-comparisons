I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after embarrassing her cousin for masturbating in her bed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 15 years old, and her cousin is also 15. They stay at her house when visiting. She lets the male cousin use her bed while she sleeps on the couch with the female cousin. She caught him masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she feels he's using her bed, and she's the one who has to wash the sheets. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nNow, the key points here. Masturbation is a natural and private activity, especially for teenagers. However, doing it in someone else's bed without considering others' comfort might be an issue. The author is not necessarily wrong for being upset about the situation. She's the one responsible for the bed and the sheets. But the way she handled it\u2014embarrassing him\u2014might be problematic. Yelling or being confrontational without giving him a chance to address it privately could make things worse. Also, the cousin's response was disrespectful, but that doesn't justify the author's actions. The author's intention was to set boundaries, which is reasonable, but the method of addressing it might have been inconsiderate. The author should have talked to him privately first before escalating to her aunt and uncle. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries on her own space. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She has a right to her space and feelings, but the approach could have been better.\n"
