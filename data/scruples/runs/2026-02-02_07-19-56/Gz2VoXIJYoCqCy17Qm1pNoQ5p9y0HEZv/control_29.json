I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl who's dealing with her male cousin, also 15, staying over. She's letting him use her bed while she sleeps on the couch. The problem arises when she catches him masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she feels disrespected and wants him to stop doing that in her bed. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle but is unsure if she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's in the wrong. The cousin is in her room, using her bed. Even if it's natural behavior like masturbation, doing it in someone else's bed might be considered inappropriate by some. Privacy expectations might come into play here. She's the one who has to clean the sheets, so maybe she has a valid reason to set boundaries. \n\nHowever, she walked in without knocking both times. That could be seen as a privacy issue for him. But since it's her room, maybe she has the right to not lock the door. The second time he didn't lock the door, which led her to catch him again. She's upset because he dismissed her feelings. \n\nIs her reaction justified? She's setting boundaries about her personal space. He's using her bed, so she has the right to expect certain behaviors. The conflict here is about mutual respect. She's not trying to control his actions outside her space but is asking him to respect her space. \n\nHer desire to inform her aunt and uncle might be about getting support, but maybe she should talk to her parents first. The key points are consent to the bed usage, privacy expectations, and mutual respect. Since he's in her room, she has the right to set boundaries about how her space is used. So she's not in the wrong here. The cousin's behavior might be inappropriate in her space, and her reaction is about maintaining her boundaries.\n"
