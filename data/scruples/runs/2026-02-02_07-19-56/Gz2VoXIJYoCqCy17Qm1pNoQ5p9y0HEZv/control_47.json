I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 15-year-old girl whose male cousin, also 15, stays in her bed when their family visits. She caught him masturbating in her bed twice. The first time, she didn't care but asked him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he was disrespectful, told her to \"piss off,\" and she's considering telling her aunt and uncle. The question is whether she's in the wrong for embarrassing him or calling out his behavior.\n\nFirst, let's consider the age. Both are teenagers, so their understanding of privacy and boundaries might be developing. The author is using her bed, which is her personal space. She's asking him to not use her bed for activities she's uncomfortable with. It's her bedroom, so she has the right to set boundaries there. Even if it's natural, she's the one who has to clean the sheets, which adds to her concern.\n\nThe cousin's response was disrespectful, which is a problem. The author isn't trying to control his body but his actions in her space. The key issue here is the violation of personal space. She's not the one in the wrong for setting a boundary. However, the way she handled it\u2014embarrassing him\u2014might be questionable. But given the context, especially the second incident where he was disrespectful, she has valid reasons to address it.\n\nAnother angle: the cousin's behavior might be inappropriate, but as a minor, there are considerations about how to handle it. The author is taking steps to protect her space and hygiene. Her intent isn't to shame him but to maintain her comfort and cleanliness. The fact that the cousin was dismissive and disrespectful makes her actions more justified.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting her boundaries, especially in her own room. The cousin's actions were the initial issue, and her response is about maintaining her personal space and respect. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
