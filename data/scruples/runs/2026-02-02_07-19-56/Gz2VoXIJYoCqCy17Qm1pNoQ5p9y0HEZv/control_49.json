I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl (the author) who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She then gets angry and considers reporting him to their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and maturity of the individuals involved. Both are teenagers, so their understanding of privacy and boundaries might still be developing. The author allows her male cousin to use her bed while she sleeps on the couch. The cousin is in her bed, and she doesn't want him to masturbate there. She confronts him and is upset when he dismisses her. The key points here are consent, respect for space, and maturity in handling the situation.\n\nThe author isn't upset about the masturbation itself but the location. She's concerned about the sheets and the respect for her space. She's also considering involving her parents, which might be appropriate given the age of the cousin. However, the cousin's argument is about his body and autonomy, which is a valid point, but at 15, their understanding of privacy and boundaries might not be fully formed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's standing up for her space, which is reasonable. However, the manner in which she might confront him and the decision to involve parents could affect the outcome. The cousin's behavior isn't illegal, but it's disrespectful considering the context. The author isn't being a \"bitch\" for setting boundaries, especially in her own room. So, the answer would be B (No), because she's asserting her right to a private space and respecting her own comfort.\n"
