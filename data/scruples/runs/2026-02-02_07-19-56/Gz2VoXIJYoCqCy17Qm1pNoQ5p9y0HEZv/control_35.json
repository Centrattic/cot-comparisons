I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their cousin after catching him masturbating in their bed. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the cousin is 15 years old, same as the author. They're staying at the author's house, and the male cousin is using the author's bed. The author catches him masturbating twice. The first time, the author doesn't care but asks him not to do it in her bed. The second time, the cousin is disrespectful, and the author is considering telling his parents.\n\nThe key points here are consent to the space and the appropriateness of the action. The author is the one who allows the cousin to stay in her room, so she has a right to set boundaries about how her personal space is used. Even if the cousin is using her bed, the author can reasonably ask him to refrain from certain activities in that space. The cousin's response being disrespectful adds another layer\u2014his attitude might justify the author's reaction.\n\nMasturbation itself is a private activity, but doing it in someone else's bed could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the owner of the bed has asked them to stop. The author's main issue isn't the act itself but the location. The cousin's refusal to comply and his disrespectful remarks could be seen as invalidating the author's boundaries, which is a social issue.\n\nNow, considering the age of both parties, they're teenagers, so their judgment might not be fully mature. However, the author is within her rights to express discomfort with how the space is being used. Whether she's in the wrong depends on her actions. If she embarrassed him publicly or in a harsh way, that could be problematic. But if she simply addressed the behavior and the boundary violation, it's reasonable.\n\nThe author is considering reporting the cousin's disrespectful behavior to the parents, which might be necessary if the cousin is being abusive. However, the main conflict is about space boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries, especially if the cousin's actions are making her uncomfortable or disrespectful towards her.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She has a right to her own space and can set rules for it. The cousin's behavior being disrespectful also gives her a valid reason to address it. However, the method she uses to address it (embarrassing him) might be questionable, but the core issue is the boundary violation.\n"
