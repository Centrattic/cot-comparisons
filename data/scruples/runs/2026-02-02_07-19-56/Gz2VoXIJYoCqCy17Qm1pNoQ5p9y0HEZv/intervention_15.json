I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old girl catching her male cousin, also 15, masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because he's using her bed, and she doesn't want him doing that in it. She plans to tell her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and maturity of the individuals. Both are minors, so maybe their actions are part of typical adolescent behavior. The girl is using her bed, and when she catches him, she's frustrated but doesn't seem to mind the act itself, just the location. She's the one who has to wash the sheets, which is a practical concern.\n\nThe cousin responds disrespectfully, telling her to \"piss off,\" which is rude. The girl wants to inform her parents about his behavior. Now, the key points here are privacy, boundaries, and respect. The girl is asserting her space by not wanting him to do that in her bed. The cousin is not respecting her boundaries by continuing the behavior and being dismissive.\n\nIs she in the wrong for confronting him? She's setting a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the method of confrontation might be an issue. Embarrassing him could be counterproductive. But given the age, maybe she's handling it the best she can. The main issue is whether her actions are justified in terms of setting boundaries versus overstepping.\n\nThe girl isn't against the act itself but the location and the disrespect. The cousin's response is disrespectful. So, she's protecting her space and hygiene. The act of informing her aunt and uncle might be a way to address the continued disrespect. \n\nBut is she being a \"bitch\"? It's possible she's overreacting to a normal teenage behavior, but her hygiene concern is valid. The cousin's refusal to respect her space is the problem here. So, the author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain her space and address the disrespect. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
