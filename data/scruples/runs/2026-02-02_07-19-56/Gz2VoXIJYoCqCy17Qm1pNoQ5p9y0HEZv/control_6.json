I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she feels he's being disrespectful, and she doesn't want him doing that in her bed since she's the one washing the sheets. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle about his disrespectful behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. The cousin is in her room, using her bed, and she's caught him twice. She's not opposed to him masturbating per se, just the location. She's emphasizing that it's her bed and her responsibility to clean. \n\nMasturbation isn't illegal, and it's a natural behavior, especially for teenagers. However, the issue here is privacy and respect for personal space. The cousin wasn't knocking or checking the door, leading to the author walking in. The author wants him to have privacy, which is reasonable. The cousin's response was dismissive and disrespectful, calling her a \"bitch,\" which adds to the problem.\n\nThe author's intention is to set boundaries about the bed being her space. She's not trying to shame him but to express her discomfort with the situation. Telling his parents might be a way to address the disrespectful behavior, but that could complicate things. However, considering the age of the cousins and the potential for embarrassment, it's a sensitive situation.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. Ethically, the author is trying to assert her right to privacy and cleanliness in her own room. The cousin's actions are inconsiderate, but the author is within her rights to ask for respect regarding her personal space. She isn't trying to prevent him from doing something he's entitled to; she's asking him to do it elsewhere. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
