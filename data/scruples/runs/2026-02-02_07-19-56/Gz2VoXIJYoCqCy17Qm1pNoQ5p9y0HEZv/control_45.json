I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author is a 15-year-old girl who sometimes hosts her cousins. She lets her male cousin use her bed while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. She walked in on him masturbating in her bed twice. She doesn't mind the act itself but is upset because it's happening in her bed, which she has to wash. When confronted, he dismissed her and called her a bitch. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and boundaries. The cousin was in her room, using her bed. Even if she doesn't mind the act, she has a right to privacy in her own space. However, walking into his room without knocking could be an issue. Wait, no\u2014she's entering her own room. So she owns the room, and he's staying there. So she has the right to be in her room. The problem is that he's doing something private (masturbation) in a shared space (her bed) without considering her.\n\nNow, the cousin was in her room, using her bed. He might have thought it's okay since he's a guest. But she's the one who lets him use her bed. The key issue is respect for her space. She asked him not to do it, and he ignored her, which led to her being upset. She's not judging him for the act itself but for the location. That seems reasonable because she's the one who has to clean up.\n\nIs she in the wrong for confronting him? She's setting boundaries. She's not being judgmental but asking for consideration. He disrespected her by ignoring her request. So she's not wrong for wanting to address it. However, maybe the way she addressed it could be considered harsh. But given that he's a guest and she's the homeowner (or at least the one allowing him to stay), she has the right to set rules.\n\nAlso, considering they're both 15, but the author is the one managing the space. The cousin's behavior is disrespectful, and she's trying to enforce her boundaries. Telling the parents might be necessary if he's not respecting her. So the author isn't in the wrong here. She's standing up for her space and the cleanliness of her belongings. The answer should be B, No.\n"
