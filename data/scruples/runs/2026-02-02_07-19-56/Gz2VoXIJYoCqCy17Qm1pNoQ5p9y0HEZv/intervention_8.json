I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. The first time, she just tells him not to do it in her bed. The second time, he ignores her, and she gets angry and is considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and the context. Both the author and her cousin are teenagers. Masturbation is a normal and healthy activity, especially for adolescents. However, the issue here is the location\u2014doing it in the author's bed. The author is upset because she has to wash the sheets, which seems a bit trivial, but maybe it's about personal space and boundaries. \n\nThe cousin is respecting his own body, but the author is the one providing the space. The problem is that he's not respecting her space when she's given him her bed. The first time, she told him not to do it in her bed, which is reasonable. The second time, he ignored her, so he's not respecting her wishes. \n\nNow, the author is considering reporting this to the aunt and uncle. But is this a privacy issue? At 15, the cousin is still a minor, and the author is also a minor. The parents might get involved. But the author's actions of embarrassing her cousin could be problematic. She walked in without knocking, which is a privacy violation. However, she was trying to get her charger. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The cousin was in the bed, which is a private space. The author entering without knocking might have been an invasion of privacy. However, since it's her bed, maybe she has a right to use it. But when he's using it for personal activities, that's a different aspect. \n\nThe author's reaction to the second incident\u2014getting angry and considering telling the parents\u2014might be a way to enforce her boundaries. But the initial act of walking in without knocking could be seen as the first wrong. However, the cousin's actions in not respecting her request afterward also contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The cousin ignored her request after she had asked him not to do it. The author did enter without knocking, but maybe that's because she had forgotten her charger and needed to get it. The main issue is that the cousin wasn't respecting her boundaries after she set them. However, the author's response of embarrassing him (maybe in front of others) could be seen as crossing a line. But she's also trying to enforce her own space. \n\nI think the cousin is at fault for not respecting her request after she clearly stated her boundaries. The author's initial entry without knocking is a minor privacy issue, but the main conflict is the cousin's disregard for her wishes. So the author isn't entirely wrong. She's standing up for her space. But the way she handled it (embarrassing him) might not be the best approach. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. Given that she set boundaries and the cousin ignored them, she's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
