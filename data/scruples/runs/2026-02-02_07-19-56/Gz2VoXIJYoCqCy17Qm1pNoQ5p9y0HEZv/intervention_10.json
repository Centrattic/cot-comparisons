I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old girl whose male cousin, also 15, uses her bed when they visit. She caught him masturbating twice in her bed. She doesn't care about the act itself but wants him to stop doing it in her bed because she's the one who has to wash the sheets. He responded disrespectfully, and she's considering telling his parents.\n\nFirst, the author isn't upset about the masturbation itself, which is a natural behavior, especially for teenagers. Her issue is the location\u2014her bed. She has a valid concern about hygiene and personal space. The cousin is respecting his own body, but using her bed for that might be crossing a boundary. She's the one dealing with the consequences (cleaning), which is a practical reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the cousin might feel that he's entitled to use the bed, but he's not considering her discomfort. The author tried to address it calmly first time, but he ignored her. The second time, she got angry. Is it her fault? She's asserting her right to her personal space and responsibilities. The cousin's response was disrespectful, which is his issue, not hers. \n\nThe key points are: her bed is her space, she's not judging the act itself, she's concerned about hygiene and responsibility. She's trying to communicate her boundaries, which is reasonable. The cousin's behavior was dismissive and rude. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
