It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 15-year-old girl, has a male cousin who's also 15. When the cousins visit, the male cousin takes her bed, and she sleeps on the couch with the female cousin. She walks into the room twice, catches him masturbating. She doesn't care about the act itself but wants him to not do it in her bed. The second time, he's disrespectful, and she's considering telling his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the dynamics here. She's using her room as a guest room. When guests are in your home, there are certain expectations. If she's comfortable with the act itself, her issue is about the location. She's the one who has to wash the sheets, which is a practical concern. However, when she catches him the first time, she just says not to do it in her bed. The second time, he's already done it again, so he might not be respecting her request. She's upset because he's being disrespectful. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's in her own room, even though it's being used as a guest room. The line between being respectful and overstepping can be blurry. If she's the one providing the space, she has the right to set boundaries. However, the act of walking in without knocking\u2014maybe that's on her? Wait, the first time she walked in without knocking to get her charger. If she didn't knock, maybe that's why she caught him. But she says she forgot her charger, so maybe it's reasonable. However, entering someone's room without knocking could be an invasion of privacy. But since it's her room, maybe it's different. If he's in her room, staying as a guest, he should expect that she might enter, but maybe he's not supposed to be doing something private in her space. \n\nThe second time, he doesn't lock the door. If he's in her room, he should be aware that others might come in, so perhaps he's at fault for not locking the door. The author is upset because he's not following her request. The cousin's response is disrespectful, and she's considering telling his parents. \n\nThe author's actions: she's trying to set boundaries about her space. She's not shaming him for the act itself, just the location. The question is whether her actions are justified. If she's providing the room, she can set rules. But if she walked in without knocking both times, maybe she's part of the problem. However, the first time was an oversight (forgetting the charger). The second time, maybe she went in expecting to find him again? That could be more problematic. \n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong, if she's the one who walks in without knocking, she might be violating his privacy. But since it's her room, perhaps she's allowed. However, the act of walking in without knocking could be seen as rude, especially if he's in there. But when you're a guest in someone's home, you might expect that the host can enter the room. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nThe cousin's behavior: doing something private in a shared space without locking the door. If he's staying in her room, he should be cautious about privacy. The author has a right to expect that her space isn't being used in a way that affects her. The sheets being hers to wash is a practical concern, which is valid. But is it reasonable to expect someone to avoid a certain activity in a guest room? Maybe. \n\nThe author's response: she's upset, calls him out, and considers telling his parents. Is that overreacting? Maybe not. If he's not respecting her rules, she's entitled to address it. However, if she's the one who walked in without knocking both times, perhaps she's part of the problem. \n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong, if she's entering without knocking, that's an issue. But if she's in her own room, maybe she has the right to enter. The key points are: the cousin is in her room (guest space), she's setting boundaries about the activity, he's not respecting her request, and he's being disrespectful. The author's intent is to protect her space and avoid a chore. \n\nSo, considering all that, is she in the wrong? It depends on the context. If she's the host, she can set rules. However, if she's entering without knocking, that's a problem. But since it's her room, maybe she can enter. The cousin's behavior is also problematic. \n\nI think the balance here tips towards the author not being in the wrong. She's setting boundaries in her own space, and the cousin is violating them. Even if she walked in without knocking, the main issue is his behavior in her room. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
