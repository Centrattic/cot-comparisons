I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 15-year-old girl who caught her 15-year-old male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She's upset because she doesn't want him to do that in her bed, and he's being disrespectful. She's considering telling her aunt and uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are: the cousin is in her room without a door locked, doing something private in her bed. The author is objecting to the location, not the act itself. She's not shaming him but wants it to happen elsewhere. \n\nLegally, both are minors, but the act of masturbation itself isn't illegal. However, sharing a room without privacy can be an issue. The author is the one who initially allowed the cousin to sleep in her bed, but then set a boundary. When he violated that boundary again, her reaction might be justified.\n\nThe cousin's response was dismissive and disrespectful. The author's concern about washing the sheets is practical. She's not trying to control him, just set a boundary. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's enforcing her own space and boundaries. Even if the cousin is using his body, doing it in her bed is about respecting her space. Her reaction is about the location, not the act. She's not being shaming, just setting a rule she expects to be followed.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's asserting her right to her personal space and hygiene. The cousin's behavior crossing the boundary by ignoring her request is the issue here.\n"
