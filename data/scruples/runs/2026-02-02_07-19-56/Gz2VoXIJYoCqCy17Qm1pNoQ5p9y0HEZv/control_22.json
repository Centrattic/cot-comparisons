I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 15-year-old girl (15f) who has cousins visiting their house. The male cousin (15m) sometimes stays in her room and uses her bed while she sleeps on the couch with her female cousin. The author caught the male cousin masturbating in her bed twice. She doesn't mind that he does it, but she's upset because he's using her bed for that. She asked him not to, but he was disrespectful, saying it's his body and she's being a bitch. Now she's considering telling her aunt and uncle about his behavior. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the boundaries of personal space and property. The author's bed is her personal space. Even though the cousin is using it when she's not there, he's in her room, using her belongings. The act of masturbating in someone else's bed might be considered inappropriate by some, especially if the owner is uncomfortable with it. The author is not against the act itself but the fact that it's happening in her bed. That's a common concern because people value their personal space and want their belongings to remain private and used in ways they're comfortable with.\n\nNext, the response from the male cousin: he's being disrespectful, not acknowledging her feelings. The author's frustration is about being disrespected. The male cousin's argument that \"it's his body\" might be a misunderstanding of the issue. The problem isn't the act of masturbation itself but the location where it's happening, which is her bed. The cousin is incorrect in his reasoning because the bed is her property, and she has the right to set boundaries on how it's used.\n\nAge is a factor here. Both are 15, but the question is about the situation. The author is taking responsibility by wanting to inform the parents (aunt and uncle) to address the disrespect. The male cousin's behavior is not just about the act but the respect towards the author's property and personal space. \n\nThe author isn't judging the act, just the location. She's asking for respect regarding her belongings. The male cousin's response was rude and dismissive. So, the author's intention to tell the parents is about setting boundaries and addressing disrespect. \n\nIs there any wrong in the author's part? She's not intruding on his privacy; she walked into her own room. She's made her request known, and he ignored it. She's standing up for her space. I don't see her being in the wrong here. The male cousin is the one overstepping by not respecting her request and being disrespectful. So the answer should be B.\n"
