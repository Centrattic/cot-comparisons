I let my male cousin(15m) take my bed and I sleep downstairs on the couch with my female cousin. \n\nOne time i had forgotten my charger and walked into my room without knocking to get and caught him touching him self. Whatever I dont care. It\u2019s natural I just asked that he not do it in MY bed. \n\nWell I ended up catching him again (he doesn\u2019t look the door) and I got pissed of because I felt he disrespected me. He basically told me to piss off, it\u2019s his body I have no say, and I\u2019m being a bitch.\n\nI really don\u2019t care if he masturbates I just don\u2019t want him doing that in bed. At the end of the day IM gonna be the one washing the sheets not him. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of calling my aunt and uncle and letting them know about his disrespectful behavior towards me, but before I do that I wanna know is this even a big deal, or am I being a bitch?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 15-year-old girl who catches her male cousin masturbating in her bed twice and then considers reporting him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The girl allows her cousin to use her bed while she sleeps on the couch. She catches him twice, and he responds disrespectfully. She's upset because she feels disrespected and wants to inform his parents.\n\nNow, considering the age of the individuals\u2014both are 15. At that age, masturbation is a normal part of development. The cousin is in his own home, using the bed provided by the host. However, the girl is the one who initially offered the bed, so maybe there's an issue of consent regarding the use of the bed. But when he's in the bed, he's in a private space. However, the girl is the one who entered the room without knocking, which might be a factor. She caught him the first time because she didn't knock. The second time, he didn't lock the door. \n\nThe girl's main issue is that she doesn't want him to masturbate in her bed because she has to wash the sheets. She says she doesn't care about the act itself but the location. She's considering reporting his disrespectful behavior. The boy responded disrespectfully, calling her a \"bitch,\" which is definitely inappropriate. \n\nSo, where's the line here? The girl's actions\u2014catching him and then potentially embarrassing him or reporting him\u2014could be seen as overstepping. She's using her position as the host to report a behavior that, while possibly uncomfortable for her, is a private matter. However, the boy's response is clearly disrespectful, which might justify her concern. \n\nBut the question is whether the author (the girl) is in the wrong. She's trying to set a boundary about her bed being used for that activity, which is reasonable. However, entering the room without knocking, especially the second time, might be her fault. She's the one who didn't knock, leading to her catching him. \n\nThe act of masturbation in a private space isn't inherently wrong, especially for a teenager. But the girl is trying to enforce a boundary regarding the bed. The boy's disrespectful response is his fault. The girl's response\u2014considering reporting it to his parents\u2014could be seen as a way to enforce her boundary. However, is she justified in doing so? \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's overreacting because she's the one who didn't knock first. She did enter the room without permission, leading to the situation. The boy was in a private space. So, maybe she's in the wrong for entering without knocking, and the boy's action is a private matter. \n\nBut she's also the one providing the bed, so maybe she has a right to set terms. It's a bit of a grey area. However, considering the boy's age and the normalcy of the behavior, maybe the girl's reaction is disproportionate. She's using her power as the host to complain about something that's a personal choice. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she's overstepping by reporting a private behavior, especially after she entered the room without knocking. The boy's disrespect is his fault, but her actions in reporting him might not be justified. Alternatively, if the bed is her responsibility to clean, maybe she has a valid point. But the main issue is the privacy and the act itself. \n\nIn many cultures, entering someone's room without permission is considered rude, so she did that, leading to the situation. Then she's upset about the behavior. It's a bit of a cycle. Maybe she's in the wrong for not respecting his privacy by entering without knocking, and then being upset about the result. \n\nTherefore, Answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
