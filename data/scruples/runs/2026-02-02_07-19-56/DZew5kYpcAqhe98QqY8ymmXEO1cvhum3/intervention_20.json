She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is a working parent with two kids, a 1-year-old and a kindergarten child. The wife stayed home after quitting her job to go back to school. They have financial reasons for not using daycare. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She's supposed to help with the kids and housework but doesn't. The author handles cooking, cleaning, laundry, and everything else, waking up early and getting the kids ready. He's also in online classes and trying to work out, but his energy is low due to lack of sleep. He feels overwhelmed and is considering that he might die young from stress.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the division of labor and emotional support. The wife has mental health issues, which might affect her ability to contribute. The author is clearly shouldering most responsibilities and feels unappreciated or unsupported. But is he in the wrong?\n\nFirst, the wife chose to stay home, not because she can't work but because she didn't enjoy her job and wanted to study. That might affect her motivation. But she's at home all day, so ideally, she should be handling more of the domestic duties. However, she's dealing with depression, which can impact productivity and willingness to engage in tasks. So there's a balance between her mental health and the household responsibilities.\n\nThe author is taking on all the work, leading to burnout. He's communicating his needs but not getting help. The wife's response is to delay tasks and not follow through. The author is in a tough spot, but maybe he's not wrong to want help. However, is he being understanding of her mental health challenges? He mentions he gives her breaks and does what he can to help her mood, which shows he's trying to be supportive.\n\nOn the other hand, expecting some level of contribution from the wife is reasonable. Just because she has depression doesn't mean she can't contribute in some way. The author might be right to feel overwhelmed and need assistance. The key issue is communication. Did he have a conversation about specific tasks and expectations? The text mentions he texts her and asks during the day, but maybe there's a lack of a structured plan or understanding of her limitations.\n\nAlso, the wife's depression might require more support. If she's refusing medication and counseling is ongoing, maybe she's in a phase where she can't manage household tasks. But the author can't do everything alone. There's a mutual responsibility here. The author is not the asshole if he's asking for help in a reasonable way. The problem might be that the wife isn't meeting her part, but the author isn't wrong to want help. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
