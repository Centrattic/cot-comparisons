She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting more help from his stay-at-home wife.\n\nFirst, the background: The wife quit her job to go back to school because she didn't enjoy her previous job. They have two kids, a 5-year-old and a 1.5-year-old. The younger one isn't in daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. The author is handling all the household chores, cooking, cleaning, childcare, and also working and taking online classes. He's getting about 4-5 hours of sleep a night and feels overwhelmed. He's asking if it's unreasonable to want more help from his wife.\n\nNow, considering the wife's mental health. She's dealing with depression, which can severely impact her ability to function. Depression often leads to lack of motivation, fatigue, and difficulty in managing daily tasks. Even if she's at home, her mental state might make it hard for her to contribute as much as the author expects. The author acknowledges her depression and tries to support her by giving her breaks and doing things to boost her mood. However, the wife isn't doing her share around the house, leading to the author feeling overburdened.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's mental health and the author's expectations. The author is doing everything except what the wife isn't doing, and he's also managing his job and studies. His health is suffering because he's sleep-deprived and stressed. The wife's depression might be a valid reason for her lack of contribution, even if she's at home. However, the author's expectations could be seen as reasonable, as having a stay-at-home parent typically involves shared responsibilities.\n\nBut here's the catch: depression can be a legitimate barrier. The wife isn't in denial about her condition and is seeking counseling. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting help, but the situation is complex. The wife might need more support or understanding, possibly professional help beyond counseling, or the couple might need to re-evaluate their expectations and roles.\n\nHowever, the author's approach of doing everything himself and not getting the help he needs is unsustainable. He's expressing concern for his health and well-being. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting more help. Given that the wife's mental health is a factor, but the author is also doing all the work, it's a balance between the two. The author's request for help isn't unreasonable, but the wife's mental state complicates things. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting assistance, especially considering the physical and emotional toll. However, the situation requires empathy towards the wife's condition and possibly a more structured approach to managing household responsibilities, maybe involving professional guidance. The answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because his request is about mutual support in a partnership, but the wife's circumstances are significant. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
