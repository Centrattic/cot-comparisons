She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the user is a husband who's working and taking classes, and his wife is a stay-at-home mom with two kids. The wife quit her job to go back to school because she didn't like her job, and they couldn't afford daycare. She also has depression and is in counseling but doesn't take meds. The husband is handling almost all the chores and childcare, and he's feeling overwhelmed. He's not getting enough sleep, and he's worried about his health. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting help around the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is at home all day, so she has more available time to help with chores, but she's not contributing. The husband is working full-time, doing online classes, dealing with a young child's interruptions, and managing household tasks. He's clearly stretched thin. The wife's mental health is a factor here\u2014she has depression and is in counseling. Depression can affect motivation and ability to perform daily tasks, so maybe that's part of why she's not helping as much as he'd like.\n\nBut the husband is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting her to do more. The key points are mutual expectations and communication. The wife might not realize how much the husband is handling, or maybe their expectations about chores and responsibilities are misaligned. The husband has mentioned feeling stressed and not taking care of himself, which is a valid concern. He's also mentioned his fear of dying young from stress, which is a serious issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has her own challenges with depression and caring for two children. It's possible that she's struggling with the emotional and physical demands of being a stay-at-home mom, especially with the depression affecting her ability to contribute. The husband might not be acknowledging how her mental health issues make it harder for her to take on more tasks. There's also the aspect of communication\u2014has the husband discussed his feelings and needs in a constructive way, or is he just venting frustration?\n\nIf the husband has tried talking to her about it and she's not responding, maybe there's a deeper issue. However, if they haven't had an open and honest conversation about their expectations and how to support each other, that could be a problem. The husband's stress is valid, but it's important to approach the situation with empathy rather than blame.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's making demands without considering her mental health and the reasons behind her lack of contribution, maybe he is. But if he's trying to communicate his needs and she's not meeting them despite his efforts, then perhaps he's not in the wrong. The line between being unfair and being reasonable is thin here. The husband's situation is tough, but he might need to approach the issue with more understanding of her mental health challenges. However, it's also fair for him to expect some help in the household, especially since she's at home.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The question is whether wanting help is the problem. In a partnership, both people should share responsibilities. The wife isn't contributing, and the husband is taking on too much. However, the wife has depression, which complicates things. The husband might not be in the wrong for wanting help, but he might need to approach the situation differently, considering her mental health. But the question is if he's in the wrong for wanting help. Since it's reasonable to expect shared responsibilities, even with her mental health issues, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's not considering her limitations due to depression, he might be. It's a bit of a gray area. But the key is that it's not just about fairness but also about communication and support. If he's not acknowledging her struggles and is just expecting her to do more without support, he might be in the wrong. But if he's trying to communicate and she's not responding, then maybe not. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because it's reasonable to ask for help, but the approach matters. However, since the user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but the analysis shows it's a complex situation where the author might not be in the wrong, the answer is B.\n"
