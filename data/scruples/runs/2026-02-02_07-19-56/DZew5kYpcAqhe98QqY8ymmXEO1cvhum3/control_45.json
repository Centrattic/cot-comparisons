She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is a husband who moved because of his job. His wife quit her job before moving because she didn't like it and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, and they don't use daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She doesn't help with household chores; he does everything. He's taking online classes to improve his career and also wants to work out but is too tired from work and taking care of the kids. He's getting about 4-5 hours of sleep, and he's feeling overwhelmed. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting help around the house since his wife is home all day.\n\nFirst, let's break down the responsibilities. The wife is at home with the kids, but she's not contributing to household chores. The husband is handling all the cooking, cleaning, childcare, and managing his job and classes. The wife's mental health is an issue, but she's in counseling. She might be in a funk and doesn't do the tasks, even when reminded. The husband is clearly stressed and not taking care of himself.\n\nNow, considering the wife's situation: she has depression and is dealing with the adjustment of moving, caring for two kids, and possibly the stress of going back to school. But she's not contributing to the household, which is causing strain on the husband. However, he's also taking on a lot, maybe more than he can handle. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting help.\n\nOn one hand, he's the one handling everything, which is understandable given the financial constraints of daycare. But the wife is at home all day, so it's reasonable to expect some help. The fact that she's not doing anything, even small tasks, might indicate that she's not able to contribute due to her mental health. But he's not being unreasonable in expecting support. He's also taking care of his own education and career, which is a positive step.\n\nThe wife's refusal to take medication might be a factor in her ability to manage tasks. However, depression can affect motivation and energy levels. The husband is trying to support her, giving her breaks, but she's not reciprocating. The key here is whether his expectations are fair. Since the wife is home, it's reasonable to expect some help with chores, even if she's dealing with depression. But if her mental health is so severe that she can't contribute, that's a different story. However, the husband is doing everything, which is unsustainable.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't asking for her to do everything, just some help. The wife's lack of contribution is causing him stress and affecting his health. The author is not in the wrong because he's asking for support in a partnership where both parties should share responsibilities, especially when one is at home. The wife's mental health is a factor, but it's not an excuse for no help at all. The husband is overburdened, and it's reasonable to want a partnership where both contribute. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
