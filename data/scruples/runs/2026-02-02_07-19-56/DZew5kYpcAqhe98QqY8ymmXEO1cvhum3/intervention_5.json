She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a stay-at-home wife who isn't contributing to household chores, and the husband is feeling overwhelmed with work, kids, online classes, and not getting help.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband is working, taking classes, and handling all the domestic duties. His wife quit her job to go back to school but isn't doing much at home. She has depression and is in counseling but doesn't take meds. The husband is doing everything, even waking up early and staying up late. He's stressed and not getting enough sleep or time for himself.\n\nOn the wife's side, she has depression, which can affect her ability to contribute. She's home with two kids, one very young. The husband mentions she gets into mood swings and doesn't do tasks. But he's also asking if he's the asshole for wanting help. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The husband is clearly overburdened. The wife's mental health is a factor, but maybe there's a communication gap. The husband has tried to give her breaks, but she still isn't helping. He's doing all the work, which is unsustainable. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's not wrong to want help. It's reasonable to expect some contribution from a spouse, especially when it's affecting his health and well-being. But maybe he hasn't communicated his needs effectively or set clear expectations. However, the wife's depression is a valid issue, but she's not taking meds. Maybe there's a lack of mutual support. \n\nThe key points: The husband is doing everything, the wife isn't contributing despite being home all day. He's stressed, and she's dealing with depression. But wanting help isn't unreasonable. The question is whether he's the asshole. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong because he's expressing a legitimate need for support, while the wife's lack of contribution is affecting both their lives. But maybe there's a middle ground. Still, the husband's situation is valid, and he's not wrong to want assistance. So answer B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
