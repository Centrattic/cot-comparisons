She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife who isn't helping with household chores, and the author feels overwhelmed. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife quit her job to go back to school and is dealing with depression. They have two young kids, and the dad is the sole income earner. He's handling all the chores, childcare, and online classes, leading to stress and lack of sleep.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole for wanting help. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user wants a straightforward answer based on analysis.\n\nI should consider both sides. The wife is at home, dealing with depression, and might have emotional or mental health challenges affecting her ability to contribute. The husband is managing work, kids, chores, and his own education. His stress is valid, and the lack of support is taking a toll.\n\nBut the wife might be struggling with her mental health, which could explain why she's not contributing. The husband has tried to communicate his needs, but she hasn't responded. It's possible she needs more support or understanding, but the husband is also right to feel overwhelmed. The balance here is tricky. The husband isn't wrong for asking for help, especially when it's affecting his health. However, the wife's mental health is a factor. But since the question is about the husband's fault, the answer would depend on whether his expectations are unreasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe key points: The husband is doing everything, the wife isn't contributing, and he's stressed. He's not necessarily wrong to want her help. The wife's depression is a mitigating factor, but the husband isn't at fault for needing support. The answer is likely B (no).\n"
