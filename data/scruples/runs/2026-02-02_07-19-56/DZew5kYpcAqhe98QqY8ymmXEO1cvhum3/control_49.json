She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's doing all the household chores and taking care of the kids while his wife is a stay-at-home mom. She had depression and quit her job to go back to school, but he feels she's not contributing enough.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She's supposed to be staying home because daycare is too expensive, but she's not helping with chores. The husband is working and taking online classes, getting only 4-5 hours of sleep, and doing everything else. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the wife has mental health issues, which complicates things. Depression can affect a person's ability to function normally, including managing household tasks. The husband is doing everything, which is understandable given the circumstances, but he's clearly overwhelmed. He's communicating his needs, which is important. However, the wife's lack of action despite being asked repeatedly is a problem.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is right to feel stressed and need support. On the other, the wife's mental health issues might be a legitimate reason for her inaction. But even with depression, some level of contribution is expected in a partnership. The husband is doing everything, which isn't sustainable. The question is whether he's wrong for expecting help.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the wife's circumstances fully excuse her lack of contribution. Since he's not a total jerk\u2014he's trying to be understanding and giving her breaks\u2014but still feels he's doing everything, and he's communicating his needs, he's not entirely at fault. However, the wife's mental health is a factor that should be considered. But overall, expecting some help from the spouse who's at home is reasonable, especially when the husband is also working and studying. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
