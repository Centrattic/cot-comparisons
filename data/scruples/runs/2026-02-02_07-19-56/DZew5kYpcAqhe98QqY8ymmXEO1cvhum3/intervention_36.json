She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to contribute more around the house. The wife has depression and isn't taking medication, and they have two young kids. The author is handling all the chores, cooking, childcare, and even managing his own studies and work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's mental health. She's in counseling but refuses meds. Her depression might be affecting her ability to contribute. The author mentions she gets into moods where everything feels wrong, which could impact her motivation.\n\nThen there's the practical aspect. The wife isn't working, so theoretically, she has time to help. But with two kids, especially a 1.5-year-old not in daycare, the workload is massive. The author is doing almost everything, including waking up early, handling chores, and taking care of the kids. He's also managing his job and studies, which adds to his stress.\n\nThe author feels overwhelmed and is concerned about his health. He's sacrificing his own well-being, which is a red flag. However, the wife's mental health issues might mean she's not able to take on more responsibilities, even if she wants to. There's a balance between expecting help and acknowledging her limitations.\n\nThe key points are: the wife's depression, the lack of childcare support, the author's heavy workload, and the communication between them. The author has tried to communicate his needs but might not have found a solution that works for both. It's possible he's not in the wrong because he's trying to manage a lot, but he might need to approach the situation with more empathy and find ways to support his wife's mental health while also addressing household responsibilities.\n\nWait, but the wife isn't doing anything. Even with depression, she's at home all day. The author is doing everything. Maybe the wife needs more support or professional help beyond counseling. Alternatively, the author might be overburdened and not getting the help he needs. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting more help. Since he's the one handling everything, it's understandable he wants assistance. However, he should consider her mental health and find a way to communicate effectively. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, but it's a bit nuanced.\n"
