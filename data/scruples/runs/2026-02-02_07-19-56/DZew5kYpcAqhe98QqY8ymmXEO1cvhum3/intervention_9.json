She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a working dad with two kids, and his wife is a stay-at-home mom who's dealing with depression. He's doing all the housework, cooking, etc., and feels overwhelmed, working online classes, not getting enough sleep. He's asking if it's his fault for wanting her to help more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife quit her job to go back to school because she didn't enjoy hers. They have two young kids, and daycare is too expensive. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses meds. The author is handling all the chores, which is causing him stress and sleep deprivation. He's worried about his health and can't keep it up.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I have to evaluate both sides. The wife is dealing with depression, which can affect her ability to contribute. But she's at home all day with the kids. The author is managing work, kids, chores, and school. It's a lot for one person. However, the wife might be struggling with her mental health, making it hard to take on more responsibilities.\n\nIs the author unreasonable for expecting help? Well, he's the one doing everything. The wife isn't contributing, but she has a valid reason in her mental health issues. But the author is also overburdened. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting her to help more. If she's not capable due to depression, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if she's avoiding responsibilities despite being able to, then maybe she is. However, depression isn't a choice. So the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n\nThe key points: The wife's mental health is a factor. The author is taking on too much, which is affecting his health. The wife might need more support, but the author is also entitled to help. The author isn't being unreasonable, so the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if the author is expecting more than he can reasonably ask. Since the wife has depression and is in counseling, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting help but the wife's situation is complicating things. The author is clearly stressed and overworked. So the answer is B.\n"
