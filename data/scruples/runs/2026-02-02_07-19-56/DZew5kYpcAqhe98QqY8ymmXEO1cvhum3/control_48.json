She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is the asshole (AITA). The scenario is that the author is a working parent with two kids, and their wife is a stay-at-home mom. The wife quit her job because she didn't like it and wanted to go back to school. They have financial reasons for not using daycare since it's expensive, and the wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. The author feels like the wife isn't contributing enough around the house, doing almost all the chores, and not following through when asked. The author is stressed, getting little sleep, and feeling overwhelmed, leading them to question if they're in the wrong for wanting help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities each person has. The wife is at home all day with two kids, one as young as 1.5 years old. That's a lot of work in itself\u2014childcare, managing the kids' needs, dealing with their emotions, etc. But the author is taking on all the household chores like cooking, cleaning, laundry, and also managing their own job and online classes. The wife isn't doing any of these tasks, which is causing strain. \n\nThe author mentions that the wife has depression and is in counseling. Mental health issues can significantly impact a person's ability to contribute to household tasks. Even if someone is in counseling, depression can make it hard to motivate or follow through with daily chores. The author acknowledges this but still feels frustrated because the wife isn't helping. \n\nThe key points here are the expectations and communication. The author hasn't specified if they've discussed their expectations with the wife. Maybe there's a lack of clear communication about what each person is responsible for. The wife might not realize how much the author is struggling, or she might be doing her best given her mental health. On the other hand, the author is taking on a lot more than just the paid work; they're handling all domestic duties, which is unsustainable long-term.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The wife isn't working because daycare is too expensive. That makes sense, but if she's home all day, it's reasonable to expect some contribution to household tasks. However, the author might be underestimating the emotional and physical labor of caring for young children full-time. The wife's role as a caregiver is significant, but maybe she's not managing the household tasks effectively due to her depression.\n\nThe author's health is also a concern. They're getting only 4-5 hours of sleep and feeling stressed, which isn't sustainable. They need to take care of themselves, but the current situation doesn't allow for that. The wife's lack of contribution is exacerbating the stress. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they're expressing a legitimate need for help and feeling overwhelmed. However, they might be failing to recognize the wife's mental health challenges and the invisible labor she's doing as a full-time caregiver. The author's approach of texting reminders and doing the tasks themselves might not be the most effective way to address the issue. Open communication and perhaps setting clear, achievable tasks for the wife, considering her mental health, could be necessary. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should contribute to the household. However, the wife's mental health is a complicating factor. The author might be expecting too much without considering her limitations. Alternatively, the wife might be avoiding her responsibilities despite her condition. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author has communicated their needs effectively and considered the wife's mental health. If they haven't, then maybe they're part of the problem. But given the information, it's clear the author is struggling and the wife isn't contributing, which is a common issue in relationships. Without more context on how they've addressed it, it's hard to say, but the author's feelings are valid. However, the wife's mental health is a valid reason for her behavior. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they also need to approach the situation with empathy and communication.\n"
