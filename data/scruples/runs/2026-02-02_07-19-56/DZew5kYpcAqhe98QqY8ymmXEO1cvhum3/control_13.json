She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband is doing all the household chores and taking care of the kids, while the wife isn't contributing much. The wife is a stay-at-home mom, but she's dealing with depression and doesn't want to take medication. They have two kids, which is a lot to handle.\n\nFirst, the husband is working and taking online classes to better his career. He's also managing the household, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and taking care of the kids' needs. He's getting only 4-5 hours of sleep a night because of the 1-year-old. He's stressed, not getting to work out, and feels like he might die young because of the stress. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help around the house.\n\nNow, the wife is at home all day. The husband mentions that she doesn't do much around the house. She's in counseling for depression, which is valid. But he's doing all the work, and even when he asks her to do small tasks, she procrastinates. He even gives an example where he left clothes ready for her to put away, but she didn't do it for a week. Also, he's had to text her during the day to remind her of things, but they still get done when he's not around.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the wife is dealing with depression, which can affect her ability to manage daily tasks. She's in counseling, which is a step, but she refuses medication. Her mental health is important, and she might not be able to cope as well as she'd like. The husband might not be aware of the extent of her struggles or might not be communicating effectively.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is clearly overwhelmed. He's handling everything, and it's affecting his health and well-being. He's working, studying, and taking care of two kids. He's asking for help, which is a basic expectation in a partnership. If both partners are in the house, it's reasonable to expect some division of labor, especially when one is working and the other is not. The wife's lack of contribution is adding to his stress, and he's feeling the physical and mental toll of it.\n\nBut the key here is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's depression is a factor, but she's still at home all day. It's possible that she's not managing her responsibilities due to her mental health, but the husband has a right to expect some level of support. The problem might be that communication isn't effective between them. Maybe he hasn't discussed his needs in a way that she can understand or act on. However, the fact that he's explicitly stating his feelings and the situation's impact on his health suggests that he's justified in wanting help.\n\nAnother angle is that the wife might not realize how much the husband is handling. Or maybe she's trying to manage her depression in her own way but isn't contributing as much as he needs. The husband could be overloading himself because he's trying to do everything, but that doesn't mean he's in the wrong for needing support.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, in many relationships, especially when one partner is working and the other is at home, there's an expectation of shared responsibilities. The wife's depression complicates things, but it's not an excuse for not contributing at all. It's a balance between understanding her mental health and the necessity of shared household duties.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's request for help isn't unreasonable. The wife might need more support or different strategies to manage her tasks, but the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting that help. He's in a tough situation, and his health is suffering because he's handling everything alone. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
