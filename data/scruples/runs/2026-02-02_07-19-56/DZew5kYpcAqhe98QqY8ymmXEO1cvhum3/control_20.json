She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife who isn't contributing much to household chores. The husband is handling all the cooking, cleaning, childcare, and even his own work and studies. He's exhausted and not getting enough sleep, and he's feeling like he's going to die young because of the stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife quit her job because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. However, that hasn't happened yet. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. The husband is doing all the household tasks, and when he asks her to help, she procrastinates or doesn't do it. He's taking care of everything, even organizing her tasks via text, but she doesn't follow through. He's working and studying, and his health is suffering because of the lack of sleep and stress.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about the responsibilities here. The wife is at home with the kids, but she's not contributing to household duties. The husband is overburdened. The wife's mental health is a factor, but she's refusing meds. However, just because she's in counseling doesn't mean she can't do basic chores. Maybe she needs more support or understanding, but the husband is also not getting the help he needs. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should contribute to household responsibilities. The husband is doing everything, which is leading to burnout. The wife might have valid reasons (mental health), but the husband's needs are also important. It seems like a communication issue. The husband has tried to communicate his feelings, but maybe not in an effective way. However, the wife isn't responding appropriately, which is causing the problem. \n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to manage everything and is reaching out for help, which he's not getting. The wife's lack of contribution is the main issue here. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the husband should have discussed expectations more clearly before the move? But he did mention he tried to give her breaks and she still doesn't help. So, the responsibility isn't being shared, and the husband is overworked. Therefore, he's not the asshole here.\n"
