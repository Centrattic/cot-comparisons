She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. The background info is that they moved recently due to his job. The wife quit her job because she didn't like it and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, and daycare is too expensive. She has depression and is in counseling but doesn't take meds. She does very little around the house, and he's handling almost everything\u2014cooking, dishes, laundry, caring for the kids, etc. He's also taking online classes and feels overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe wife is dealing with depression, which can affect her ability to contribute. While she's at home, depression might make even simple tasks hard. The author mentions she's in counseling, which is good, but she's not taking meds. Maybe she's resistant to treatment, but that's her choice. However, her depression could be a valid reason for not helping with chores. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is handling all household responsibilities, working, taking classes, and caring for the kids. He's getting 4-5 hours of sleep and feels he can't keep this up. He's expressed his concerns to her but she's not responding. The key points here are communication and mutual support.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because he's asking for help to maintain a healthy household. But maybe he hasn't approached her about it in a way that's constructive, considering her mental health. If he's not communicating effectively or being supportive, that could be an issue. However, the fact that he's trying to manage everything alone and is at risk of burnout suggests he's not the asshole. \n\nThe question is whether the wife's depression is a barrier. While her mental health is a factor, she's still at home and has the time. There might be a need for better communication and finding ways to support her through her depression to encourage more participation. But the author's request for help isn't unreasonable. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's seeking balance, but there's room for improvement in how he handles the situation. However, if he's not being understanding of her mental health struggles, maybe he's partly at fault. But the main issue is that he's overwhelmed and needs help, so he's not entirely in the wrong.\n"
