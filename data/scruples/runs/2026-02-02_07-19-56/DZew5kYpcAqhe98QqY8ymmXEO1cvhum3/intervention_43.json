She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a person who is working and taking classes, with a stay-at-home wife who has depression and isn't helping with household chores. The key points here are about the division of labor, mental health, and communication.\n\nFirst, the wife quit her job because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. But she's also dealing with depression, which might affect her ability to contribute. The author is doing almost all the housework and childcare, which is leading to stress and lack of self-care. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let's consider the wife's situation. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. Her depression might make it hard for her to take on responsibilities. The author mentions she doesn't do anything at home, which could be due to her mental health. However, there's a lack of communication mentioned. The author says he's told her he feels like he might die young from stress, but maybe he hasn't effectively communicated his needs in a way that encourages her to help, considering her mental state.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking on a lot, but he's also in a situation where he's working and studying. It's a common issue in partnerships about sharing responsibilities. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting his wife to contribute more. If the wife is unable to help due to depression, maybe he's not wrong. But if there's a lack of effort on his part to address the issue constructively, maybe there's a problem.\n\nThe author's response to her not doing things is to do them himself, which might not be sustainable. He's also using texts to remind her, but she's not following through. There's a possibility that the author didn't address the issue in a way that considers her mental health. For example, maybe he could have a more compassionate conversation rather than just expecting her to do things without understanding her capacity.\n\nIn terms of fairness, neither partner should bear all the burden. The wife might need more support given her depression, but the author's well-being is also important. The key here is whether the author's expectations are reasonable given her condition and if he's communicated this effectively. If he hasn't tried to work with her on a plan that accommodates her mental health, then he might not be in the wrong. But if he's being demanding without considering her situation, maybe he is.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's overwhelmed and trying to manage work, studies, and childcare alone. However, there's a need for better communication. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the solution. Since the wife has a valid mental health issue, but the author is also struggling, it's a balance. The author isn't wrong for wanting help; the problem is more about the wife's mental health and how to address it.\n"
