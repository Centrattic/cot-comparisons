She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife who isn't contributing much around the house, and the husband is overwhelmed with work, kids, and his own studies. He's doing almost all the chores and feels like he can't keep up. He's even worried about his health.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife left her job to go back to school, but they can't afford daycare for their kids. So she's at home, but not doing much. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses meds. The husband is handling all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, kid duties, and more. He's getting very little sleep and is stressed. He wants her to help more, but she's not responding. He's even said he might die young from stress.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is he in the wrong for wanting more help? The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides. The husband is clearly overwhelmed. The wife has mental health issues, which can affect her ability to contribute. But she's at home all day, so maybe there's a balance issue here.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is doing everything. He's working, taking classes, and managing two kids. It's a lot, and it's reasonable for him to expect some help, especially since the wife is at home. On the other hand, the wife has depression and might be struggling with motivation. She might not be able to help as much as he expects due to her mental health. But is that an excuse? Maybe not entirely. She's been in counseling, but not taking meds. Maybe she needs more support or a different approach.\n\nThe husband's communication might be part of the problem. He mentions texting her reminders, but maybe he hasn't set clear expectations or boundaries. If he's asking her to do things but she's not following through, perhaps a more structured approach is needed. However, he's also not giving her credit for her struggles. He might be overburdening himself without considering her mental health challenges.\n\nAnother angle: The wife chose to stay home, but maybe there's an unspoken agreement about household responsibilities. The husband might feel entitled to more help, but if they didn't discuss roles after moving and adjusting to her schooling, that's a gap. The husband might need to have a serious conversation about responsibilities and perhaps seek couples counseling to address both their needs.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't wrong to want help. But the way he's approaching it\u2014texting reminders, doing everything himself\u2014might not be effective. The wife's depression is a valid factor, but she's not using medication, which could be a barrier. Maybe the husband should consider professional help for them as a couple to navigate this situation better.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting help, but he might be handling it in a way that isn't addressing the root issues. The wife's mental health is a significant factor, but that doesn't mean the husband should bear all the burden. The answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
