She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a working parent with two kids, and their wife is a stay-at-home mom. She quit her job before moving because she didn't like it and wanted to go back to school. They can't afford daycare, so she's supposed to take care of the kids and housework. But she's not doing much at home, and the author is doing almost everything else. He's stressed, not getting enough sleep, and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is being unreasonable. He's handling all the chores, cooking, cleaning, childcare, and even his own work and studies. The wife has depression and is in counseling but isn't taking medication. She's supposed to be home, but she's not contributing. The author is asking if it's okay to want more help.\n\nThe key points here are: both are parents, the wife is at home but not assisting, the author is taking on all the responsibilities, and there's a mental health issue involved. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for expecting more help. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's doing everything alone, which is unsustainable. Even though the wife has depression, it doesn't mean she can't contribute in some way. The author is trying to balance work, studies, and family, and is struggling. The wife's lack of involvement is adding to his stress. It's reasonable for him to want support in managing household duties. He's communicated his feelings, so the issue is more about the wife's contribution than the author being unfair. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
