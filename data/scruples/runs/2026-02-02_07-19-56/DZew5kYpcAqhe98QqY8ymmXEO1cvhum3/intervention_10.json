She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a working parent with two kids, a stay-at-home wife who quit her job to go back to school. The wife has depression and isn't helping with chores. The author is doing all the housework, cooking, laundry, etc., and is feeling overwhelmed, not getting enough sleep, and is worried about his health.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife is at home all day, but the author is handling all the domestic responsibilities. The wife has depression, which is a valid mental health issue, and she's in counseling. But she's not taking meds and sometimes gets into moods where she can't handle things. The author is trying to be supportive by giving her breaks but is frustrated because she doesn't contribute. He's also in online classes, working, and taking care of the kids. He's exhausted, only getting 4-5 hours of sleep, and feels like he's not taking care of himself.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this objectively. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He's juggling a job, online classes, and parenting two young kids. His wife is supposed to be helping but isn't. He's doing everything, leading to burnout and health concerns. He's communicated his feelings, but it's not working. He's not asking for a lot, just basic help around the house. Given that she's at home all day, expecting her to contribute more is reasonable. The author is trying to be understanding of her depression but is also at his breaking point.\n\nOn the wife's side: She has depression, which can make it hard to manage daily tasks. She's in counseling but refuses meds. Her mental health is a real issue that affects her ability to function. However, depression doesn't mean she can't do anything. She's supposed to be the stay-at-home parent, so some level of contribution is expected. The fact that the author is handling everything might be exacerbating her depression or not allowing her to take on any responsibility, which could be part of the problem. Also, maybe there's a communication breakdown. The author is texting her to do tasks, but she's procrastinating. Maybe she's feeling overwhelmed or not supported.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's not considering her mental health enough, maybe he is. But he's also being fair in that she's at home and should contribute. The key here is mutual support. The author might be expecting her to do more than she can handle given her depression, but he hasn't mentioned seeking professional help for her beyond counseling. He's also not taking care of his own health, which is a concern. However, the core issue is the division of labor. The wife isn't helping as expected, leading to the author's stress. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should share responsibilities. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting help. The wife's mental health is a factor, but she still has a role in the household. The author is communicating his needs, and if she's not meeting them despite her issues, that's a problem. Maybe the author needs to approach this with more empathy and find ways to support her mental health so she can contribute more. But he's already doing that by giving her breaks. \n\nAlternatively, the author might not be considering her limitations enough. For someone with depression, even small tasks can be huge. If the author is expecting her to do chores when she's in a funk, that's unreasonable. But she's not doing anything, not even the small things he asks. It's a balance between being understanding and setting boundaries. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's clearly overwhelmed and is trying to communicate his needs. However, there's room for both sides to improve. The wife's mental health needs to be addressed more effectively, and the author should perhaps seek couples counseling to better navigate this situation. But in terms of right vs. wrong, the author's desire for help is valid. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
