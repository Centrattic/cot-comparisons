She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole for wanting more help from his stay-at-home wife. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the background: They moved because of his job. His wife quit her job before moving to go back to school. They have two kids, a kindergarten and a 1.5-year-old who's not in daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression, is in counseling, but doesn't take meds. She has mood issues. The husband is handling all the household chores, cooking, dishes, laundry, getting up early to take care of the kids before work, and even doing tasks she's supposed to do but doesn't. He's also taking online classes and trying to work out but can't because he's exhausted from working and managing everything else. He's getting about 4-5 hours of sleep a night. He's feeling overwhelmed and stressed, even saying he might die young from stress.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting help. Let's consider the factors. The wife is a stay-at-home mom, but she has depression and isn't taking medication. The husband is doing everything, but maybe he's not communicating effectively. He mentions texting her to remind her to do things, but she doesn't follow through. He also says he's trying to work on himself (taking classes) but lacks time for self-care. The wife's depression might affect her ability to contribute, but does that absolve her from all responsibility?\n\nOn one hand, he's clearly overburdened. On the other hand, he's not getting help from his wife. But is he in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing her to stay home; she chose to leave her job for school. However, the financial situation is a factor since daycare is too expensive. The wife's mental health is a significant factor here. If she's in a funk, maybe she's not functioning at her best. But he's the one doing everything. Maybe he should have discussed expectations more clearly? Or maybe he's not being empathetic enough about her mental health?\n\nThe key points: He's doing all the work, which is understandable given the circumstances, but is he overstepping? He's not wrong to want help. The wife's depression is a complicating factor, but that doesn't mean she can't contribute in any way. Maybe there's a communication gap. He's expressed his feelings, but she's not responding. It's possible that the wife also feels overwhelmed and doesn't know how to manage. However, the husband's needs are valid. He's stressed, not taking care of himself, and this could lead to burnout. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, when one spouse is staying home with kids, they usually share household duties. If the wife is doing nothing, that's a problem. But considering her mental health, maybe there's a need for counseling or medical help. The husband could be more supportive of her mental health while also setting boundaries. But is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's not being unreasonable in wanting help. The wife's lack of contribution is an issue, but the husband's stress and workload are valid. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). The wife's mental health is a factor, but he's entitled to support and cannot be expected to handle everything alone.\n"
