She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. Let me start by understanding the background.\n\nThe couple recently moved because of the husband's job. The wife left her job because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. However, with the cost of daycare being high, they decided not to work, so she's a stay-at-home mom. They have two kids, a 5-year-old in kindergarten and a 1.5-year-old not in daycare. \n\nHe mentions she has depression, is in counseling, and refuses meds. She has periods where she's unhappy and doesn't do anything at home. He's doing all the cooking, dishes, laundry, early mornings to get the kids ready, and even handles tasks she's supposed to do, like sorting laundry. He feels overwhelmed, working and taking online classes, getting only 4-5 hours of sleep, and not having time to work out. He's worried about his health and can't keep up the pace.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to contribute more. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the wife is a stay-at-home mom, which typically involves managing the household and childcare. However, she has depression and is in counseling, which affects her ability to contribute. The husband is taking on all the household duties, which is a lot, especially with two young kids. He's also working and studying. \n\nIt's important to consider mutual expectations. When they decided she would stay home, maybe there was an unspoken agreement about shared responsibilities. If she's not contributing, maybe communication is an issue. The husband has tried talking to her and even texts reminders, but she's not following through. Her depression might be a factor, but she's not taking meds and might need more support.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be overwhelmed with childcare and dealing with her mental health. The cost of daycare is a factor, so she's not working, which is a financial decision they made together. But if she's not helping with chores, it's adding to his stress. \n\nIs he wrong for wanting more help? It's reasonable for him to expect some contribution, especially since she's at home. However, considering her mental health, there's a balance. Maybe he needs to approach this differently, like seeking couples counseling or adjusting expectations based on her current state. But from his perspective, he's clearly overburdened and not getting the support he needs. \n\nThe key points are: he's doing everything, she's not contributing, he's stressed, and she has mental health issues. It's not entirely his fault to want help, but maybe he's not approaching the situation in a way that considers her limitations. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the solution is perfect. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because it's reasonable for him to want help, especially when it's affecting his health. The problem is more about communication and her mental health challenges rather than him being in the wrong for needing support.\n"
