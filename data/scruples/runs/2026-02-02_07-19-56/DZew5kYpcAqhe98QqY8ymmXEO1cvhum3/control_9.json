She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a working parent with two kids, and their wife is a stay-at-home mom who isn't contributing much around the house. The wife has depression and isn't taking meds, but the husband feels overwhelmed and is doing almost everything. He's even sacrificing his own health and time because he's so busy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife quit her job to go back to school, which the husband supported, but now he's asking for help with chores. The wife is dealing with depression, which can affect motivation and energy. The husband is doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, childcare, and even his own work and studies. He's getting very little sleep and not taking care of himself, which is concerning.\n\nThe key points are: the wife has a mental health condition that's impacting her ability to contribute, the husband is overburdened, and there's a lack of communication or resolution. The husband feels like he's the only one contributing and is at risk of burnout. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for wanting more help? Well, he's not wrong to want support. It's reasonable to expect a partner to share household responsibilities, especially when they're at home all day. The wife's depression might be a factor, but the husband should communicate his needs and perhaps suggest professional help beyond counseling if needed. However, the wife's refusal to take medication and the lack of progress in sharing chores could be issues. The husband's stress and health concerns are valid, so it's not entirely his fault. But maybe he could have addressed this earlier or found a better way to communicate his needs. Still, the main problem is the imbalance and the wife not contributing despite being able to. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
