She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a working parent with two young kids and a wife who is a stay-at-home mom. The wife quit her job to go back to school, which they mentioned is not feasible because daycare is too expensive. The wife has depression and doesn't want to take medication, which the author acknowledges. But the author is taking on all the household responsibilities, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare, while the wife isn't contributing. The author is feeling overwhelmed, not sleeping well, and is concerned about their health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a marriage regarding household responsibilities. The author's wife is at home all day, so it's reasonable to expect her to help with chores, especially with two young children. However, the wife has a mental health condition that affects her ability to contribute. The author mentions that the wife gets into funks where she's unhappy and doesn't do anything. The author is trying to support her by giving her breaks, but the wife still isn't helping. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The author has clearly communicated their needs but hasn't received the help they expect. The wife's depression is a valid challenge, but it's also possible that she's not being proactive in managing her mental health or seeking additional support. The author is doing everything themselves, leading to burnout and health concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be placing unrealistic expectations on the wife given her mental health issues. It's possible that the wife is trying her best under the circumstances, but the author isn't giving her enough support or understanding. The author could be overstepping if they're not considering the wife's mental health limitations and not seeking professional help or adjusting their expectations accordingly.\n\nBut looking at the details, the author has made efforts to accommodate the wife's depression, like giving her breaks, and even mentions that the wife is in counseling. The wife isn't taking medication, which might be a choice that affects her ability to function. The author is doing all the work, which is unsustainable, and the wife isn't fulfilling her role in managing the household. The author's health is at risk, which is a serious issue. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's important for both partners to share responsibilities. If the wife is unable to contribute due to mental health issues, the author might need to adjust their expectations, but there's a balance. The wife's inaction is contributing to the problem. The author is not wrong in wanting help; they're in a situation where they can't manage everything alone. The wife's depression is a factor, but it's not an excuse for complete lack of contribution. The author has communicated their needs and is taking steps to improve their own situation, like taking classes and wanting to work out. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for wanting help around the house. The wife's mental health is a factor, but the author has done their part to support her and still isn't getting the help needed. The key is that both partners need to work together, and the author is reasonable in expecting some contribution from the wife despite her challenges. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
