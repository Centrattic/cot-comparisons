She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband is doing all the household chores, taking care of the kids, and even managing his own work and studies. His wife is a stay-at-home mom but isn't contributing much. She has depression and is in counseling but not taking meds. The husband feels overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole for wanting help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife left her job because she didn't like it and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, and daycare is too expensive. So the wife is home all day. But she's not doing her share around the house. The husband is doing everything, which is causing him stress and lack of sleep. He's even sacrificing his own health goals like working out.\n\nThe wife's depression is a factor here. She might be struggling with motivation due to her mental health. But the husband is also feeling like he can't handle everything alone. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to help more.\n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable for him to expect some help, especially since she's at home. But on the other hand, her depression could be affecting her ability to contribute. The husband might need to communicate more effectively, maybe find ways to support her mental health while also dividing responsibilities. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe key points are: the wife's mental health, the husband's workload, and the lack of cooperation. The husband is clearly overwhelmed. But does that make him the asshole? Or is the wife not pulling her weight despite being home? Also, the husband is trying to manage his career and studies, so his stress is valid. But he hasn't mentioned discussing his needs with her in detail, maybe?\n\nIn some cases, expecting someone with depression to do chores might be unrealistic without proper support. But the husband is asking if he's wrong for wanting help. The answer might depend on whether the wife is capable of contributing more, considering her mental health. Without proper communication or understanding, the husband might be in the right to ask for help. However, if the wife is doing her best given her condition, maybe he needs to adjust his expectations. But since she's home all day, expecting some help seems reasonable. So maybe the author is not in the wrong.\n"
