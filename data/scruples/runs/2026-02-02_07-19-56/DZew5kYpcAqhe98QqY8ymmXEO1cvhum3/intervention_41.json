She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife not contributing enough to household chores while the husband is working and taking classes.\n\nFirst, the wife quit her job because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, a 5-year-old and a 1.5-year-old. The husband handles almost all the chores, cooking, dishes, laundry, and childcare. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She's supposed to do some tasks but doesn't follow through, leading the husband to feel overwhelmed and stressed.\n\nThe husband is working, taking online classes, and trying to work out but can't because of the lack of help. He's getting about 4-5 hours of sleep a night. The key points here are the distribution of household responsibilities and the wife's ability to contribute despite her mental health issues.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The wife is at home all day and the husband is handling everything. The husband has communicated his feelings, even saying he might die young because of stress. The wife's depression might affect her ability to help, but she's in counseling. The question is whether the husband is being unreasonable in expecting help or if the wife is failing to meet her responsibilities despite her mental health.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is doing everything, which is a lot. But on the other, the wife might be struggling with depression, which can impact motivation and energy. However, the husband's needs are also valid. The author is asking if wanting help is unreasonable. The wife's excuses and not following through might indicate she's not fulfilling her role, but her mental health is a factor. It's a balance between mutual support and individual responsibilities. If the husband has communicated clearly and the wife isn't meeting her end despite her condition, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the wife's mental health is a valid barrier and the husband isn't supporting her enough, then maybe he is. However, the husband is clearly overwhelmed and needs help. The answer here hinges on whether the wife's refusal to take on tasks despite being home is uncooperative, leading to the husband being right to ask for help.\n"
