She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. Let's start by looking at the details provided.\n\nFirst, the wife is a stay-at-home mom because she quit her job before moving to go back to school. They have two kids, a 1.5-year-old and a kindergartener. The parents mention that daycare is too expensive, so the wife is handling childcare. The wife has a history of depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She's described as going into moods where she's unhappy and not doing much around the house. The husband is doing all the cooking, dishes, laundry, and managing the kids' routines. He's also juggling work and online classes, leading to only 4-5 hours of sleep a night. He's feeling overwhelmed and stressed, not getting any personal time, even exercise, and is concerned about his health.\n\nThe main question is whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting his wife to help more. Let's consider both sides. From the husband's perspective, he's taking on an enormous workload, both in terms of work, his studies, and childcare. He's clearly stretched thin and is in danger of burnout. On the other hand, the wife is dealing with depression, which can affect her ability to contribute, even if she wants to. However, it's also mentioned that she is at home all day, which means she has the time to help, but she's not doing much. The husband has tried communicating, but it's not effective.\n\nNow, depression is a significant factor here. It can cause people to feel unmotivated, have low energy, and struggle with daily tasks. If the wife is in counseling but not taking medication, maybe that's part of her treatment plan. But it's possible she's not getting the right help or needs more support. However, the husband is doing everything, which isn't sustainable.\n\nBut here's the thing: in a partnership, especially when one is working and the other is at home, it's expected that there's a division of labor. The wife is at home, so she should be able to contribute to household chores. However, the husband is doing all the work, which is unfair. The wife might not be in the right mental state to help, but that doesn't mean the husband is in the wrong for wanting her to do more. He's the one suffering from stress and lack of self-care, which could lead to serious health issues.\n\nAnother angle: the husband is trying to communicate by texting and asking for help, but the wife is not following through. Maybe the communication isn't effective. The husband might need to approach the conversation differently, perhaps with more empathy, considering her mental health. But the core issue is that the work is unbalanced. The wife is not contributing, leading to the husband's burnout.\n\nSo, is the husband the asshole? The key points are that he's doing all the work, not getting help, and is at risk of health issues. The wife has mental health challenges, but she's at home and has the capacity to contribute more. The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting help. He's the one carrying the load, and it's unreasonable to expect that from one person. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
