She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a working parent with two kids, and their wife is a stay-at-home mom but isn't contributing much around the house. The wife has depression and doesn't take meds, which the author acknowledges. The author is handling all the chores, cooking, cleaning, etc., and is feeling overwhelmed, not getting enough sleep, and not being able to take care of themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly stressed and overworked. They're managing work, taking classes, taking care of the kids, and doing all the household chores. It's a lot. But the wife has mental health issues, which might affect her ability to contribute. She's in counseling but refuses meds. It's possible that her depression is making it hard for her to manage tasks, even though she's home all day.\n\nThe author wants more help around the house. Is it fair for them to expect that? Well, the wife is at home, so she does have the time. But depression can make even simple tasks feel impossible. The author might not fully understand how her depression is impacting her ability to contribute. The wife's excuses like \"I'll do it in a little bit\" could be legitimate symptoms of her condition rather than just laziness.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking on an unreasonable amount of work. They mention working and taking classes, and taking care of the kids. The stress is leading to them not taking care of their health and feeling like they might die young. That's serious. The author needs support, and maybe they're not communicating their needs effectively to the wife. It's possible that the wife is aware of the author's stress but doesn't know how to help, or maybe she's not getting enough support herself for her depression.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting help isn't unreasonable, but maybe the approach could be better. The author is taking on too much, but the wife has mental health challenges. The key here is whether the author is being understanding of the wife's condition while also advocating for their own needs. The author is doing the right thing by acknowledging the wife's depression and trying to give her breaks, but perhaps there's a communication breakdown. The author might need to have a more constructive conversation with the wife about how to divide responsibilities, considering her mental health limitations.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're seeking help and trying to balance work and family, it's more about the wife's circumstances. The author isn't the one refusing help or being inconsiderate of the wife's issues. They're trying to manage a lot and are feeling overwhelmed. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because they're in a challenging situation and have valid concerns.\n"
