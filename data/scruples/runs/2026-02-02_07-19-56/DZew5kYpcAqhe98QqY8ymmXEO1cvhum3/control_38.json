She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting more help from their stay-at-home wife. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nSo, the couple moved because of the husband's job. The wife quit her job before moving because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, a 1.5-year-old not in daycare due to cost, and a kindergartener. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She doesn't do much around the house. The husband does all the cooking, dishes, laundry, takes care of the kids, and even works online classes. He's getting about 4-5 hours of sleep a night because the baby wakes him up. He feels stressed and like he's not taking care of himself, and he's worried about his health.\n\nThe husband is asking if he's the asshole for wanting help. He's doing almost everything. The wife has a mental health issue, which the husband acknowledges. But he's doing all the chores and taking care of the kids. The wife doesn't contribute, and he's feeling overwhelmed.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's think. The wife is at home all day, but she has depression. However, even with that, some basic tasks could be expected, like putting away clothes or helping with the kids. But maybe she's dealing with mental health issues that make it hard for her to take initiative or follow through.\n\nThe husband is clearly overburdened. He's working, taking classes, and handling all the domestic responsibilities. It's unrealistic to expect a person to manage all that without support. The wife might need more encouragement or maybe a different approach to get her involved, but the husband's feelings are valid. He's not wrong to want help. The key is whether his expectation is unreasonable given her circumstances. The fact that she has depression and refuses medication complicates things, but she's still responsible for some tasks. The husband shouldn't have to do everything. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
