She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to help more with household chores. So, first, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author is working, taking online classes, and managing two kids. He's handling all the chores, cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc., while his wife is home all day. She has depression and doesn't want medication, but she's not contributing much. He's feeling overwhelmed, not getting enough sleep, and worried about his health. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting help.\n\nOn the other hand, his wife quit her job to go back to school, which is a valid reason. She's dealing with depression, which can affect motivation and ability to contribute. She's in counseling, but maybe the mental health aspect is making it harder for her to take on tasks. The author mentions she gets in moods where everything feels bad, so maybe she's not being lazy but is struggling with her mental health.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The key factors here are communication, mental health, and shared responsibilities. The author is clearly overwhelmed and has tried to communicate his needs but hasn't seen results. However, his wife's depression might be a barrier. It's possible they haven't found a good middle ground. The author's demands for help might be reasonable, but his wife's mental health issues could mean she can't meet those expectations right now.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling he needs help? Probably not. He's doing all the work and it's affecting his health. But he might need to approach the situation with more empathy, considering her mental health. However, the user's question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting help. The answer might be B (No), because he's justified in wanting support, but there's a need for better communication and understanding both sides' challenges.\n"
