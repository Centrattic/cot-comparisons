She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a working husband who's doing all the household chores and childcare because his wife is a stay-at-home mom. They have two kids, and the wife has depression and doesn't want to take medication. The husband is feeling overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole for expecting more help.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife quit her job before moving because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. But they decided she wouldn't work here because daycare is too expensive. So she's a SAHM. She has depression, is in counseling, but not on meds. The husband is doing all the cooking, dishes, laundry, waking up early to take care of the kids so she can sleep in. He texts her during the day to remind her of tasks, but she doesn't do them. Even when he asks her to do small things, she delays. The husband is taking online classes and feels he's not taking care of himself because of stress and lack of sleep.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides. The husband is clearly overwhelmed and is doing a lot. The wife has mental health issues, which might affect her ability to contribute. Depression can make even simple tasks feel impossible. But he's asking for help, and she's not providing it, leading to his stress.\n\nOn one hand, the husband has a right to expect some help, especially since the wife is at home all day. He's working and taking classes, which is a lot. On the other hand, the wife's mental health is a factor. If she's in a funk, maybe she can't help even if she wants to. But he's been asking for help for a while, and she's not doing anything, which could indicate a lack of effort.\n\nI need to consider if the husband is being unreasonable. He's not asking for a lot\u2014basic chores, but they're not getting done. The wife's depression might be a valid reason, but it's also possible that she's avoiding responsibilities. The husband mentions that he gives her breaks, but she still doesn't contribute. Maybe there's a communication issue. He's texting her, but maybe he's not approaching it the right way. However, the wife's excuses and delays seem to be a pattern.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's choice to be a SAHM might come with responsibilities. The husband is taking on all the work, which is unsustainable. But if her depression is severe, maybe she can't help. However, the husband is also not taking care of his own health, which could be a problem. The key is whether the wife is being negligent or if her mental health is genuinely preventing her from helping.\n\nIn the end, the husband is feeling overburdened and is asking for help. If the wife isn't contributing despite his efforts, maybe he's not wrong in wanting more support. But if her mental health is the main issue, maybe he needs to approach it differently. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting help. Given the situation, I think he's not in the wrong. He's doing all the work and is taking care of the kids, his job, and his education while also managing his health. So I would lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
