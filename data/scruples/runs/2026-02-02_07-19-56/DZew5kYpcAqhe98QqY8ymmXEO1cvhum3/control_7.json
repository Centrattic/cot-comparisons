She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who is a working parent and taking online classes, while his wife is a stay-at-home mom but isn't helping with household chores. The wife has depression, is in counseling, and the couple moved recently because of his job. She quit her job to go back to school, but daycare is too expensive for their income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is handling all the chores, childcare, and his work and classes, getting only 4-5 hours of sleep. The wife isn't contributing to the household, which is causing him stress. The key points are the wife's mental health, the financial situation (daycare is too expensive for her to work), and the division of labor.\n\nThe wife's depression and her not wanting medication is important. Mental health can affect a person's ability to contribute, even if they're physically present. But she's at home all day. The husband is expecting help, which is a reasonable expectation in a partnership. However, the wife's depression might be a barrier. He's trying to support her by giving her breaks, but she still isn't contributing.\n\nIs the husband being unfair? He's asking for help in a shared home. The fact that the wife is at home all day might mean she has the time, but her mental health is a factor. The husband is taking on too much, which is unsustainable. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's communicating his needs and she's not meeting them despite her circumstances, is he wrong for wanting change?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's not considering that her depression makes it hard for her to help. Maybe he needs to be more empathetic. But from his perspective, he's overwhelmed and needs support. The wife might need more active support, like the husband helping her find ways to manage her depression or adjusting their expectations given her mental health challenges.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the husband's request for help is unreasonable given the wife's situation. If the wife's depression is a legitimate barrier and she's not medicated, maybe the husband needs to adjust his expectations. But if the wife is capable of contributing but isn't, then the husband is justified. However, the wife's depression might be a mitigating factor. The husband is also doing all the childcare and household work, which is a lot. The answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), because it's reasonable to expect shared responsibilities, but the wife's mental health is a complicating factor. The husband is also overextended. So, he's not the asshole for wanting help, but the situation is complex. The answer is B.\n"
