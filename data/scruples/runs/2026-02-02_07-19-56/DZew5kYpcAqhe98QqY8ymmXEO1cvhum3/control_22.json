She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to do more. The situation involves a lot of responsibilities falling on the author, who is working and taking online classes, while the wife, who quit her job to go back to school, isn't contributing much around the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife has depression and isn't on medication, which might affect her ability or willingness to help. The author is handling all the childcare, cooking, cleaning, etc., and is getting very little sleep. The wife is at home but not doing her share, leading to the author's stress and health concerns.\n\nThe key points are: the wife isn't contributing to household chores, the author is overwhelmed, and there's a mental health component. The author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting help. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if both partners are supposed to share household responsibilities, the author is right to expect some help. However, the wife's mental health issues could be a factor. But the author mentions that they do what they can to support her mood, so maybe the lack of help is an issue of the wife not pulling her weight despite the support.\n\nThe author is working, in school, and taking care of two kids, which is a lot. The wife is at home but not contributing, which is leading to the author's burnout. The author is clear about their feelings of stress and health concerns, which are valid. The wife's excuses are leading to tasks not getting done, and the author is stepping in every time. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing their needs and asking for help, which is reasonable. The wife's mental health is a factor, but the author has made accommodations. The author isn't blaming the depression but is pointing out the lack of action. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting help. They're overwhelmed and seeking support, which is a normal expectation in a partnership. The wife's not fulfilling her part, but that doesn't mean the author is the asshole for wanting her to contribute. The author is trying to communicate their needs, even if the wife isn't responding as hoped.\n"
