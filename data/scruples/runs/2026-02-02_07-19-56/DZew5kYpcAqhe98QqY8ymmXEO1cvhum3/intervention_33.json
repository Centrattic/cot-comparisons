She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who's doing all the housework and taking care of the kids while his wife, who is home, isn't helping. The husband is feeling overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife left her job to go back to school and has depression. She's in counseling but not on meds. The husband is handling all the chores and childcare, working, and taking online classes. He's getting little sleep, only 4-5 hours a night because the 1-year-old wakes up. He's also trying to work out but can't because he's too tired. The wife isn't doing her share, which is leading to tension.\n\nSo, the key points are: the wife is home but not contributing, the husband is handling everything, and he's feeling stretched thin. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nThe wife has mental health issues, which might affect her ability to help. However, being home doesn't mean she can't do some tasks. The husband is clearly struggling, and the wife's lack of contribution is causing stress. The question is whether the husband is wrong for wanting more help.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if one partner is handling all the responsibilities, it's unreasonable to expect them to do so alone. The wife might be dealing with depression, but that doesn't absolve her from all responsibilities. It's possible she's not managing her mental health effectively, but the husband should communicate his needs better. However, in this case, he's already communicated the issues and isn't getting the help he needs. The wife's excuses and lack of action are problematic.\n\nThe husband is taking care of the kids, cooking, cleaning, and managing everything else. His health is suffering because he's not getting rest or time for himself. The wife, while dealing with her issues, isn't stepping up. The husband isn't wrong for wanting help. The problem is the imbalance in responsibilities. The wife might need more support or understanding, but the husband isn't at fault for expecting a share of the workload.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's entitled to expect some help with the household tasks, especially given the stress he's under. The wife's mental health is a factor, but it shouldn't mean the husband has to do everything alone.\n"
