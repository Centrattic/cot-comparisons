She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who's doing almost all the housework while his wife is at home. The wife quit her job to go back to school, but they can't afford daycare, so she's taking care of the kids. However, she's not helping with chores, and the husband is overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The husband is working, taking online classes, and handling all the household responsibilities. He's getting very little sleep and is worried about his health. The wife has depression and doesn't take medication, relying on counseling instead. She's in a funk sometimes and doesn't contribute as much as he'd like.\n\nThe main question is whether the husband is unreasonable for expecting help. From his perspective, he's doing everything and is at risk of burnout. He's trying to better his career but can't because he's overwhelmed. The wife is at home all day, so she has time to help, but she's not doing it. Her mental health is a factor, but he's also trying to support her.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might have valid reasons for not contributing. Her depression could be affecting her ability to help. She might be dealing with the emotional labor of being a mother and handling the kids' needs, which can be draining. Maybe she's not communicating her feelings or the reasons why she can't help. However, the husband has tried to give her breaks and remind her to take on tasks, but she's not following through.\n\nThe key points are mutual responsibility and communication. The husband is clearly overwhelmed and needs support. The wife's mental health is a legitimate issue, but she also needs to contribute where she can. It's a balance. The husband isn't wrong for wanting help, especially since he's managing work, classes, and the kids. The wife's lack of contribution is a problem, but it's not entirely her fault if her mental health is affecting her ability.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? Probably not. He's doing his best and is reasonable in asking for help. The wife might need to take more initiative, but the husband isn't in the wrong for not being able to handle everything alone. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
