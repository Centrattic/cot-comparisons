She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. \n\nFirst, the background: they moved because of the author's job. The wife quit her job before moving to go back to school. They have two kids, a 1.5-year-old not in daycare due to cost, and a kindergartener. The wife has depression and is in counseling but avoids meds. The author is handling all the chores, cooking, cleaning, and childcare, while the wife is not contributing. The author is also working and taking online classes, getting very little sleep, and struggling with stress and not having time for self-care.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's mental health issues and the uneven division of labor. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nThe wife has depression, which is a significant factor. Depression can affect a person's ability to perform daily tasks and contribute to household responsibilities. The author acknowledges her issues and tries to support her, but she's not pulling her weight. However, it's possible that her mental health is impacting her ability to help more than the author realizes. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is clearly overwhelmed. They're managing work, school, two kids, and all the housework. The stress and lack of self-care could be leading to burnout. The question is whether the author is unreasonable in expecting more help from the wife. But given the wife's mental health, maybe the author should be more understanding. However, the author is also responsible for their own well-being. It's a balance between supporting a spouse with mental health issues and ensuring one's own needs are met.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for wanting help. It's reasonable to expect some contribution, especially since the wife is at home all day. However, the wife's depression complicates this. The author might need to communicate better, seek couples counseling, or find a middle ground where the wife can contribute within her mental capacity. The author's stress and health are also important. If the wife isn't helping, maybe the author is justified in feeling the need for support. \n\nBut is the author being too demanding? If the wife's depression is severe and she's not taking medication, maybe the author should adjust their expectations. However, the author is sacrificing their own health. This is a tricky situation. The answer depends on whether the author is being unreasonable. The author is working, studying, and handling everything, which is unsustainable. They have a right to expect some help, especially since the wife is at home. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to consider if the author is overstepping given the wife's circumstances. However, the wife's refusal to help despite being able to (even small tasks) suggests that the author's request is valid. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
