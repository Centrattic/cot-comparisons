She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a working parent with two young kids, and their wife is a stay-at-home mom who isn't helping with household chores. The wife has depression and doesn't take meds, but she's not contributing much. The author is doing almost everything around the house and feels overwhelmed, leading to stress and lack of sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife quit her job to go back to school, but now they don't have daycare for the younger child. The wife is dealing with depression and counseling. The author is handling all the cooking, cleaning, childcare, and even working on their own education. They're not getting enough sleep and are concerned about their health.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, they're clearly feeling overwhelmed. They\u2019re doing everything, which is unsustainable. The wife isn't contributing, despite having the time. But she has mental health issues, which complicates things. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting help.\n\nOn one hand, the author is right to feel that the workload is too much. They\u2019re doing all the chores and childcare, which is a lot. It's reasonable to expect some help, especially when the wife is at home. But on the other hand, the wife has depression, which might affect her ability to contribute. The author acknowledges this and says they try to give her breaks. However, the wife isn't doing her share, leading to resentment.\n\nI should also consider communication. The author says they've told their wife they feel like they might die young from stress. That's pretty harsh. Maybe the author isn't approaching the situation constructively. Instead of just expressing frustration, they might need to have a more open conversation about expectations and how to support each other given the wife's mental health. \n\nAnother angle is that the wife might be struggling more than she's letting on. Depression can make even simple tasks feel impossible. If the author is expecting her to do tasks without understanding the depth of her depression, that could be part of the problem. The author might not be recognizing the mental health challenges affecting the wife's ability to contribute.\n\nBut the author is also doing everything, which isn't fair. Even with mental health issues, there might be some tasks the wife can manage, especially if they're broken down or approached differently. The key here is balance. The author is justified in wanting help, but maybe their approach is part of the issue. They might need to work with their wife to find a way to split responsibilities, considering her mental health, rather than expecting her to do everything all at once.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because it's reasonable to want help when overburdened. However, there's room for the author to improve communication and understanding of the wife's mental health. The wife's depression does play a role, but the author isn't wrong for feeling they need more support. The situation is complex, and the author is within their rights to seek help with the household duties.\n"
