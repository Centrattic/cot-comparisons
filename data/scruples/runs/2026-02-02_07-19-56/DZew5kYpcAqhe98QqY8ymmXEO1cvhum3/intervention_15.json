She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a working parent with two kids, and they've moved due to the job. The wife is a stay-at-home mom but isn't contributing much to the household, leading to the author taking on most of the responsibilities. The author is feeling overwhelmed, not getting enough sleep, and is concerned about their health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife quit her job to go back to school and also has depression, which they\u2019re dealing with through counseling. The author is handling all the cooking, cleaning, childcare, and even working on their own education. The wife isn't doing much, and the author feels unsupported. \n\nThe key points are: the wife is at home all day, the author is handling everything, and the author is struggling with stress and health. The wife has mental health issues, but the author feels like they can't take care of themselves because they're too busy. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting more help. The author is taking on a lot, and it's clear they're feeling burnt out. However, the wife has depression and might be struggling with motivation or energy. It's important to consider communication here. The author mentions they've talked to her about the situation, but maybe not in a way that's effective. \n\nIn some cases, when one partner has mental health challenges, the other might take on more, but that doesn't mean it's fair. The author is clearly overwhelmed, and expecting some level of contribution from the wife, even if it's small, might be reasonable. The wife's depression could be a factor in her inability to help, but it's also possible that she's not managing her responsibilities adequately. \n\nThe author's main issue is the lack of support. They're handling everything, which is unsustainable. The fact that the wife is at home all day and not contributing could imply that some help is expected. The author's health is a concern, and they're worried about not taking care of themselves. \n\nBut I should also think about the wife's perspective. If she's dealing with depression, maybe she's not able to take on household tasks, even though she's at home. The author might not be considering the mental health aspect enough, but they're also not getting the help they need. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a balance. The author has the right to ask for help, especially since they're working and studying. The wife's depression might affect her ability to contribute, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong for wanting assistance. It's possible that the wife needs more support or understanding, but the author's needs are also valid. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're overwhelmed and need support. However, if the wife's mental health is the main reason she can't help, then maybe the author isn't being empathetic enough. But given the situation, the author is clearly struggling and needs help, so they aren't in the wrong for wanting it.\n"
