She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for expecting their stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. From the background, the wife quit her job to go back to school. They have two kids, a 5-year-old and a 1.5-year-old. They don't use daycare because it's too expensive compared to what she'd earn. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses meds. She's supposed to be at home, but the husband is doing all the chores, cooking, cleaning, etc. He's also in online classes and working, so he's really stressed and not taking care of himself.\n\nThe key points here: The wife is at home, but not contributing. The husband is doing everything, including taking care of the kids, which is a lot. He's also handling his work and studies. He's exhausted. The wife has depression, which affects her ability to contribute, but she's not on medication and maybe the husband expects her to push through despite that. \n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, in a marriage, both partners should share responsibilities. But considering the wife has mental health issues, maybe he's not being understanding enough. However, he's also not asking for help and is doing everything himself, leading to burnout. The wife's depression is a valid reason for her not contributing, but the husband might not be communicating his needs effectively or supporting her in a way that encourages her to help. \n\nBut the question is, is he in the wrong? If he's expecting her to take on more household duties without considering her mental health, that could be on him. On the other hand, she's at home all day, so the expectation is reasonable. The balance here is tricky. The husband might be overburdened, but the wife's mental health is a factor. Maybe he's not wrong for wanting help, but he's not approaching it the right way. However, the answer options are A for yes (he's in the wrong) or B for no. \n\nGiven that he's the one shouldering everything and the wife has mental health issues, but he's not addressing that properly. He's not working with her to find a solution that accommodates her depression. So maybe he is in the wrong for not being empathetic enough. But if he's just asking for help and she's not contributing, he's not in the wrong. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since she's at home and he's the one working, maybe he's not the asshole. But he's also not managing the situation effectively. The answer seems to hinge on whether his expectations are reasonable given her mental health. If he's not considering her condition, he's in the wrong. If he's asking for fair help and she's refusing, he's not. It's a bit of both. But given the options, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the wife is at home and should contribute, even with her depression. However, maybe he's not supporting her properly. But the question is whether he's the asshole. The original poster thinks he's in the wrong, but others might say no. So I think the answer is B.\n"
