She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a man who recently moved because of his job. His wife quit her job to go back to school but hasn't started yet. They have two young kids, and she's dealing with depression. He's handling all the household chores, cooking, taking care of the kids, even while working and doing online classes. He's getting about 4-5 hours of sleep a night and is stressed about not taking care of himself. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help around the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is dealing with depression and in counseling. She doesn't take meds and sometimes gets into moods where she's unhappy. The husband is doing everything at home, and the wife isn't contributing as he'd like. He's feeling overwhelmed and is worried about his health.\n\nOn one hand, the wife is dealing with mental health issues, which can impact her ability to contribute. But on the other hand, the husband is doing everything himself, leading to burnout. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting more help. \n\nThe husband is clear about his feelings and the burden he's under. He's tried talking to her and even texts her to remind her of tasks, but she doesn't follow through. He's also mentioned his own health concerns. It seems like he's communicated his needs but isn't getting the support he wants. \n\nHowever, the wife is managing her depression and trying to go back to school. Her mental health could be a factor in her inability to contribute more. But it's also about communication. Maybe there's a lack of understanding between them about what each can reasonably handle. The husband might be expecting too much from her current state, or she might not be able to meet those expectations due to her mental health.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's clearly stressed and overworked. He's not the one with the mental health issue, so it's understandable he's feeling the strain. But is he being unreasonable? He's asking for help, which is a normal expectation in a marriage. The problem is that the wife isn't able to provide it due to her own issues. So maybe the problem isn't that he's in the wrong, but that they need to find a better balance or seek more help together.\n\nThe key points are communication, mutual support, and realistic expectations given their circumstances. If the husband has communicated his needs and the wife still isn't able to meet them, maybe the issue is more about their current situation rather than either being in the wrong. But if he's not acknowledging her mental health struggles and is being overly critical, that could be a problem. However, the husband is also taking care of everything, which is unsustainable and leading to his own health issues. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband is not necessarily in the wrong for wanting help, but the situation is complex. The answer would likely be B (he's not in the wrong), but it's important to note that both parties might need to adjust their expectations and find a way to support each other better, maybe with professional help.\n"
