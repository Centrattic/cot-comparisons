She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The setup is that the husband is working, taking online classes, and handling all the household chores, while the wife, who is a stay-at-home mom, isn't contributing as much. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. The husband is feeling overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole for wanting help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is doing everything: cooking, cleaning, laundry, childcare, and his job and studies. He's getting very little sleep because of the 1.5-year-old waking up. He's exhausted and feels he's not taking care of himself. On the other hand, the wife is dealing with depression, which can make it hard to contribute. She's trying to go back to school, so maybe she's focusing on that. But she's at home all day, and the husband is doing all the work.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If the wife has depression, it's a valid reason for not contributing, but the husband's argument is that he can't keep sustaining this. He's not asking for equality, just help with basic tasks. The wife's excuses are things like \"I'll do it later,\" leading to tasks being neglected. \n\nI think the key points here are: the wife's mental health issues might be affecting her ability to help, but the husband is also overworked. The husband is not the one with the mental health issue, so he's in a position where he's trying to manage everything. The wife might need more support, but that doesn't absolve her from contributing in some capacity. However, the husband's approach might be part of the problem. He's asking her to do specific tasks but when she doesn't do them, he takes over. Maybe there's a communication breakdown. The husband hasn't mentioned discussing this with her in a constructive way, just that he's doing everything and is stressed. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be in a state where she can't help, and the husband is expecting her to do more than she's capable of. But the husband's workload is unsustainable. The user's perspective was that the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. If the wife's depression is making it impossible for her to contribute, then the husband might need to adjust, but he's clearly at his breaking point. \n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong. He's doing everything and feeling burnt out. The wife's mental health is a factor, but the husband has a right to ask for help. The problem might be that they haven't found a way to balance their responsibilities given her mental health. The husband's stress is legitimate, and he's not the one with the mental illness. So he's not an asshole for wanting help. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
