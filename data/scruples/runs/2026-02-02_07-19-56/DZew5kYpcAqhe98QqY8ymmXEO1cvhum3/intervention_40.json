She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a man who works and takes online classes, while his wife is a stay-at-home mom. They have two kids, and the wife has depression. He's doing all the chores and feels overwhelmed, not getting help from his wife. He wants her to contribute more but she doesn't. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife quit her job to go to school because she didn't like her job. But then they have two kids, and daycare is too expensive. So she's a stay-at-home parent. The author is handling all the household responsibilities because the wife isn't doing anything. He's also taking care of the kids and work, and his health is suffering.\n\nNow, the wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. Her not doing chores could be related to her mental health. The author mentions she gets into moods where she's unhappy and doesn't do much. But the author is feeling alone, doing everything, and wants her to help around the house. He's also worried about his health and not having time for himself.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the question is about whether he's the asshole for wanting more help. On one hand, he's clearly overburdened. But on the other, maybe he's not considering her mental health issues enough. Maybe he's not communicating effectively. The wife might be struggling with depression, which affects her ability to contribute. But the author is trying to do all the work, which isn't sustainable.\n\nBut the wife is at home all day. If she's not working, maybe she should be handling more domestic tasks. However, her depression could be a valid reason for her inability to do so. The author might need to have a deeper conversation about this, maybe with a therapist or counselor, to address the root issues. The author is asking for help, but if the wife is struggling, maybe the problem is bigger than just asking her to do chores. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. He's doing everything, but the wife's mental health might be a barrier. However, expecting some level of contribution from her is reasonable. The key here is whether the author is unfairly expecting her to do more without considering her mental state. If the wife is truly incapacitated by depression, then the author might need to adjust his expectations. But if she's choosing not to help despite being able to, then maybe the author is justified. It's a bit of a balance.\n\nIn the end, the author is seeking help and support, which is understandable. But the wife's mental health is a factor. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe the situation is more complex and requires a nuanced approach. The wife's depression might be affecting her ability to help, so the author might need to approach the issue with more empathy and possibly seek professional help together. But the author wanting help isn't wrong. So probably answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
