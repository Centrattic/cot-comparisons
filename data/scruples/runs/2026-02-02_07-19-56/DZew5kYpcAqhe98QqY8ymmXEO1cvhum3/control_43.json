She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to contribute more around the house. The wife quit her job to go back to school and is dealing with depression. They have two kids, and the author is handling most of the chores and childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's situation. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. Her mental health could affect her ability to manage household tasks. The author is taking online classes and working, so they're both under a lot of stress. The kids are young, and the author is handling most of the responsibilities, leading to exhaustion and lack of sleep.\n\nThe wife isn't contributing as much as the author would like. She does little tasks but delays them, and the author feels overwhelmed. The question is whether the author is at fault. The author is clearly overwhelmed and is asking for support, which is a normal request in a marriage. However, the wife's mental health might be a barrier to her contributing more. The author is trying to communicate their needs but might not be approaching it effectively. It's possible that the wife is unable to meet expectations due to her depression, and the author might need to adjust their expectations or seek couples' counseling to address communication issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to feel supported in their role as a working parent. The balance of responsibilities isn't fair, and the author is doing the majority of the work. The key issue is communication and understanding each other's limitations. The author isn't wrong for wanting help; the problem might be in how the request is being made or the wife's ability to respond given her mental health. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because it's reasonable to ask for shared responsibilities, especially when the current situation is unsustainable.\n"
