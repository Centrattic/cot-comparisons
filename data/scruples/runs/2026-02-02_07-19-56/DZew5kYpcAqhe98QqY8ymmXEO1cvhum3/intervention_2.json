She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a working parent with two kids, and his wife is a stay-at-home mom who used to work but quit to go back to school. The main issue is that the wife isn't contributing to household chores, and the author is overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts presented. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She's dealing with young children, which is challenging. The author is handling almost all the domestic duties, work, online classes, and even taking care of the kids at night. He's getting only 4-5 hours of sleep and feels like he's not taking care of himself. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the wife has mental health issues and might be struggling. On the other, the author is clearly overburdened and asking for support. It's possible that communication is a problem. The author mentions texting reminders and tasks being left undone. Maybe there's a lack of effective communication or understanding of each other's limitations.\n\nDepression can affect a person's ability to manage daily tasks. If the wife is in a funk, she might not be able to contribute as much. The author might not be considering her mental health challenges enough. However, it's also reasonable for him to expect some level of support, especially since he's handling so much.\n\nI should also consider the dynamics of their relationship. Moving recently could be adding stress. The wife might be dealing with the transition, adjusting to being a stay-at-home mom, and her own educational goals. Maybe she's overwhelmed too, but not expressing it. The author's approach of doing everything himself might not be sustainable, leading to burnout.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is unreasonably placing blame on his wife without considering her circumstances. He might be expecting more help than she's capable of providing given her depression. Alternatively, he might need to have a more open conversation about their roles and find a balance that works for both their situations.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is justified in feeling overworked, but he might be neglecting his wife's mental health challenges. The question is whether he's being unreasonable in his expectations. The answer might hinge on whether there's mutual understanding and compromise. If the wife is truly unable to help, the author might need to adjust his expectations or seek other solutions, like professional help or reevaluating their living situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong because he's communicating his needs and the situation is untenable. However, there's a possibility that he's not fully understanding his wife's limitations. But given the information, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because he's clearly overwhelmed and it's reasonable to seek help.\n"
