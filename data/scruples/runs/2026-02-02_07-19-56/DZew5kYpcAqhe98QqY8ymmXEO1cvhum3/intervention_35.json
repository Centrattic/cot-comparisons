She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. The background is that they recently moved because of his job. The wife quit her job and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, and daycare is too expensive, so the wife is taking care of the younger one. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She's supposed to be handling the household, but the author is doing almost everything, leading to him feeling overwhelmed and stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is at home, supposed to be managing the kids and housework, but isn't contributing. The author is handling all the chores, which is leading to burnout. He's also trying to work and take online classes, and not getting enough sleep or time for self-care. He's clearly overwhelmed and needs support.\n\nBut the wife has depression and other issues. She's in counseling, which is a good step, but maybe her depression is affecting her ability to manage household tasks. The author understands her condition but feels like she's not pulling her weight. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting help.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both partners should contribute to household duties. However, the wife's mental health issues might be a factor. It's possible that she's struggling more than she can handle, and maybe the author expects too much without considering her limitations. But at the same time, the author is doing everything, which isn't sustainable. Communication is key here. If he's not communicating his feelings effectively or setting boundaries, that could be his fault. But if he's made reasonable requests and she's not responding, maybe she's at fault.\n\nThe author mentions that he's asked her to do small tasks, and she delays them. The example of the clothes in the basket for a week shows a lack of action. If he's already doing so much and she's not contributing, even with her mental health challenges, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, it's also possible that he needs to be more empathetic and find a way to support her mental health while dividing responsibilities.\n\nAnother angle: the wife might feel guilty about not helping due to her depression, but the author's approach of texting her and doing everything himself might not be effective. Maybe he needs to have a more open conversation about their expectations and find a way to share the load, even if it's not equally. But since she's at home, she should be able to handle more. The fact that he's working and taking classes, yet doing all the housework, is unsustainable. So maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting help, especially if he's communicated that and she's not responding.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community often considers intent and effort. If the author is trying to communicate and the wife isn't meeting her responsibilities, he might not be the asshole. But if he's not considering her mental health enough, maybe he is. However, the key point is that she is supposed to be managing the house and kids, and he's doing all the work. The author's stress and health are valid concerns. So the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
