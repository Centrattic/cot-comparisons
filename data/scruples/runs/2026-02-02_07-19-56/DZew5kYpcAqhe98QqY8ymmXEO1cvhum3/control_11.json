She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a working husband and a stay-at-home wife who isn't contributing much to household chores. The wife has depression and is in counseling but doesn't take medication. The husband is handling all the chores, taking care of the kids, working, and doing online classes. He's feeling overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities each partner is taking on. The husband is managing all the domestic tasks, childcare, work, and his education. That's a lot. The wife is at home but isn't contributing, which is causing stress. But she has depression, which might affect her ability to help. The key here is whether her mental health is a valid reason for not helping, or if the husband's expectations are reasonable.\n\nDepression can significantly impact a person's motivation and energy, even if they're home all day. The wife is getting counseling, which is a step towards managing her mental health, but she's refusing medication. However, the husband is also not getting the support he needs. He's not asking for help just for convenience but because he's overburdened and concerned about his health.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both partners should share household responsibilities. The wife is home and could contribute, but her mental health issues might be a barrier. However, the husband isn't just asking for basic help; he's doing everything himself, leading to burnout. The question is whether the husband is unreasonable in expecting more help, considering his wife's mental health, or if he's justified in feeling overwhelmed.\n\nIt's possible that communication is the issue here. The husband has tried talking to her but hasn't found a solution. The wife's excuses like \"I'll do it later\" suggest she's not engaging with the tasks, possibly due to her depression. But even with depression, some level of contribution is expected in a partnership. The husband's health is also at risk if he continues this pace.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's often expected that both partners contribute to household duties. The fact that the wife chose to stay home to go back to school doesn't absolve her from responsibilities. The husband isn't asking her to take on all the work but wants a fair share. The wife's depression may require accommodations, but the husband's needs are also valid. Without mutual support, both can suffer.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the husband's expectations are unreasonable given his wife's mental health. Since he's handling everything and she's not contributing despite being home, it's likely the husband isn't in the wrong. The wife may need more support or treatment for her depression, but the husband isn't the asshole for wanting help.\n"
