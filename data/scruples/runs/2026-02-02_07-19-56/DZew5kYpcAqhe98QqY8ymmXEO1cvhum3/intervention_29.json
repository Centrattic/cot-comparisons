She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting help from his stay-at-home wife with household chores.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his wife quit her job to go back to school because she didn't enjoy her previous job. They have two kids, a 1-year-old not in daycare and a kindergarten child. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses meds. The author does all the cooking, dishes, laundry, and takes care of the kids' morning routines. He asks her to do small tasks but she procrastinates, leading to him having to do everything. He's also stressed, sleeping only 4-5 hours a night, and wants to take online classes and work out but can't because of the workload.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author is handling all domestic responsibilities and childcare, which is a lot. His wife is at home but not contributing, which is causing him stress and affecting his health. However, she has mental health issues, which might impact her ability to manage chores. The question is whether expecting help is unreasonable given her circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, the author is doing everything, leading to burnout. On the other, the wife has depression and might be struggling to cope. The key here is whether the author's expectations are reasonable. If the wife is unable to contribute due to her mental health, maybe the author should seek support or professional help. But if she's capable but refusing to help, then the author has a right to feel wronged.\n\nThe author mentions that he tries to give her breaks and does what he can to boost her mood. However, she still doesn't help. The task of putting away a week's worth of folded clothes didn't get done, which shows a lack of action despite being asked. This suggests that the wife is not fulfilling her role, even if she has mental health issues.\n\nThe author's health is suffering, and he's concerned about his longevity due to stress. This is a valid concern. The balance of responsibilities is clearly lopsided. While mental health is a factor, it doesn't absolve her of all responsibilities. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since he's handling everything else.\n\nIn relationships, sharing responsibilities is important. If the wife is unable to help, perhaps the approach should be to find solutions together, like adjusting expectations or getting external help. But the author is correct in wanting support. It's not about being in the wrong; he's overwhelmed and needs assistance. The wife's depression is a challenge, but the author's need for help isn't unreasonable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's justified in wanting help, and the wife isn't contributing despite being at home. His stress and health concerns are valid, and expecting some level of shared responsibility is reasonable, especially with two children.\n"
