She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The author is a man who moved for his job, his wife quit her job to go back to school but they can't afford daycare for their kids. The wife has depression and doesn't take meds, but he's feeling overwhelmed because she's not helping with household chores. He's doing almost everything: cooking, cleaning, taking care of the kids, even doing laundry. He's also in online classes and working, and only gets 4-5 hours of sleep. He's asking if it's his fault for wanting help around the house since she's at home all day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is clearly stressed and overworked. He's juggling a job, online classes, and taking care of two young children by himself. His wife has a mental health issue (depression) which might affect her ability to contribute. She's in counseling but refuses medication, which might impact her daily functioning. Her excuses are that she'll do things \"in a little bit,\" which turns into not doing them.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is dealing with depression, which is a legitimate health issue. She's at home with the kids, but maybe the author expects her to be more proactive. However, depression can make it hard to perform even simple tasks. The author is asking if he's wrong, but it seems like he's in a very difficult situation, expecting his wife to help when she's struggling with mental health. \n\nBut wait, the wife chose to stay home, right? Because they can't afford daycare, and she quit her job. But maybe the author's expectations are unrealistic given her depression. The key point is whether he's in the wrong for wanting help. If the wife isn't capable due to her mental health, then he's not in the wrong for feeling overwhelmed. However, maybe he should be more understanding of her condition and communicate better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not considering that the wife's depression is affecting her ability to contribute. He might be expecting her to act as if nothing is wrong. But he also mentions that she doesn't do \"shit\" at home, which is harsh. It's possible that he's not recognizing her struggles with depression and is being unfair. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's expecting her to do more without considering her mental health, then he might be in the wrong. But if he's genuinely trying to share responsibilities and she's not contributing despite being able to, then he's not. The key is the balance between his expectations and her capacity given her depression. The author is clearly stressed, but if the wife is unable to help, maybe he's not wrong for wanting assistance. However, if he's not addressing the issue with empathy, that could be a problem. \n\nIn the end, it's about mutual support. If the wife is struggling with depression, the author might need to adjust his expectations or seek outside help. But if he's not being understanding, then he could be in the wrong. However, given the information, the author is in a tough spot and might not be entirely at fault. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
