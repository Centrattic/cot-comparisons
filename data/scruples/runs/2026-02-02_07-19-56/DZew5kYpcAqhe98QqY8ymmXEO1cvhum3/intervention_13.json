She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a man who moved for work, and his wife quit her job to go back to school. They have two kids, and they don't use daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression and doesn't take medication, but she's in counseling. The author is doing all the housework, cooking, laundry, dishes, taking care of the kids, and even handling things after work. He feels overwhelmed, doesn't get enough sleep, and is worried about his health. He's also taking online classes to improve his career. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting help from his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is at home all day, but she has depression and is in counseling. She's not on medication and might have days where she's not functional. The author is handling all the responsibilities, which is a lot, especially with two kids. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting help.\n\nOn one hand, he's doing everything, and it's affecting his health. He's not getting enough sleep, not working out, and feels stressed. The wife isn't contributing, maybe because of her depression. But on the other hand, the wife might be struggling with her mental health, which could make it hard for her to take on more responsibilities. Is it fair to expect her to do more when she's dealing with depression?\n\nThe author is trying to manage work, online classes, and household duties. He's also taking care of the kids. The wife is at home but not helping. He's asked her to do things, but she procrastinates or doesn't do them. He's even had to do tasks that he asked her to do, like sorting clothes. The example with the clothes in the basket for a week shows a pattern. \n\nBut does that mean he's in the wrong? Maybe not. He's clearly overwhelmed. However, he might need to communicate better with his wife, set boundaries, or seek support. But the question is about whether he's the asshole. The wife might have valid reasons (depression) for not contributing. However, the author is also responsible for their family and his own well-being. \n\nI think the key points are: Is the author being unreasonable in expecting help? The wife is at home, but her mental health is a factor. The author is doing everything, but maybe he's not communicating effectively. However, he's clearly in a bad situation and is trying to manage. The fact that he's not taking care of himself and is worried about dying young shows the severity. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author's expectations are reasonable given his wife's circumstances. If the wife is struggling with depression, it's possible she can't take on the responsibilities he's asking for. However, the author isn't wrong to want support. The problem might be communication or understanding each other's situations. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not. The wife's mental health is a significant factor, but the author is also in a tough spot. It's a complex situation. If the answer is about whether he's the asshole, then maybe he isn't. He's doing everything and is at the breaking point. But he needs to address the issue with his wife in a supportive way, maybe involving counseling. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's in a stressful situation and has valid concerns. However, he might need to approach it differently to address his wife's mental health and his own well-being.\n"
