She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a working parent taking online classes, dealing with a stay-at-home wife who isn't contributing much around the house. They have two kids, one in kindergarten and a 1.5-year-old not in daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression and isn't taking medication, but the author feels overwhelmed handling all the chores and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a marriage. The wife did quit her job to go back to school, which might explain why she's not working now. But she's at home all day, so the assumption is she could help with chores. However, the wife has mental health issues, which is a significant factor. The author acknowledges her depression but also points out that she doesn't follow through with tasks even when asked. \n\nThe author is handling almost all household duties, which is leading to stress and lack of self-care. They mention wanting to work out but not having time, leading to health concerns. The key question here is whether the author is unreasonable in expecting their spouse to contribute more, given the wife's mental health challenges.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both partners should share household responsibilities. However, the wife's mental health issues might affect her ability to meet these expectations. The author is doing the bulk of the work and feeling burnt out. It's possible that the wife is struggling with her depression, which makes it hard for her to participate as much as the author expects. \n\nBut there's a balance. The author has made communication attempts, texting reminders and asking for help, but the wife isn't following through. The wife's excuses and procrastination might be exacerbating the issue. The author's health is a concern too, as they're not taking care of themselves and are worried about the long-term effects.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting more help? Well, it's reasonable to expect some contribution, especially since the wife isn't working and is at home. However, the author might not be addressing the root of the problem, which is the wife's mental health. Instead of just assigning tasks, maybe they need to work together on strategies that accommodate her condition. The author's approach of doing everything themselves might not be sustainable, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong for wanting help. They're trying to communicate, but perhaps more structured problem-solving is needed.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior\u2014putting off tasks for days, not responding to requests\u2014suggests she's not meeting her responsibilities. The author is doing all the work and is stressed. The wife's depression is a factor, but she's in counseling and chooses not to take meds. The author's frustration is valid because they're overburdened.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's expectations are reasonable, the situation is complex. The wife's mental health plays a role, but the author is also overextending themselves. The answer might depend on whether the author is being understanding of the wife's challenges while still seeking a balanced division of labor. Since the author is making efforts to communicate and the wife isn't responding effectively, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting more help. The blame might be shared, but based on the facts given, the answer is more likely B (author not in the wrong).\n"
