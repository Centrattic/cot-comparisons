She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a working parent taking online classes, and their stay-at-home wife isn't helping with household chores or childcare. The author is feeling overwhelmed and is asking if they're the asshole for wanting more help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author explains that they're handling almost all the domestic responsibilities, working, and studying. Their wife has depression, is in counseling, and isn't taking medication. She's supposed to be at home, but she's not contributing as much as the author would like. The author mentions feeling exhausted, getting little sleep, and wanting to take care of themselves but not having the time.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's mental health is a factor. Depression can significantly impact someone's ability to function and contribute. The author acknowledges her struggles but also feels that she's not doing her part. The key question is whether the author is being unreasonable given the wife's circumstances.\n\nI should think about what's reasonable to expect from a stay-at-home parent, especially with mental health challenges. If the wife is in a funk and unable to help, maybe the author's expectations are too high. However, the author is doing everything alone, which is unsustainable and affecting their own health. It's a balance between empathy for the wife's condition and the author's legitimate need for support.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author has talked to the wife about the situation, but maybe they need to approach it differently. Perhaps setting clearer expectations or working with the wife's therapist to address the issue. The fact that the wife procrastinates and doesn't follow through even when asked might indicate deeper issues that require professional help.\n\nAlso, the author's concern about their own health is valid. They mention feeling like they might die young from stress. It's important to address this before it leads to serious health problems. The author isn't just asking for help out of selfishness but because they're under a lot of stress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the wife is at home, she's dealing with depression. But she's still a parent and should contribute to household duties. However, given her mental health, it's possible she's doing her best but not enough for the author's needs. The author might need to adjust their expectations or find ways to support the wife's mental health to encourage more participation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're not considering the wife's mental health struggles and not seeking a balanced solution, maybe. But if the wife is genuinely unable to help due to her condition and the author is bearing all the load, then the author isn't entirely at fault. The situation might be a result of both parties needing to communicate better and find a middle ground.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's feelings are valid, and they have a right to ask for help. However, they might need to approach the situation with more understanding and maybe seek counseling together to address the underlying issues. The answer isn't black and white, but based on the information given, the author is not in the wrong because their needs are legitimate and the situation is affecting their well-being.\n"
