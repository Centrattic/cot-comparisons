She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. The main points from the scenario are:\n\n1. The wife is a SAHM, chose to quit her job before moving to go back to school. They can't afford daycare because it's too expensive.\n2. She has depression and is in counseling but doesn't take meds. She has periods of being in a funk and not happy.\n3. The husband is handling all the cooking, cleaning, childcare, etc. He works and takes online classes, gets little sleep, and is overwhelmed. He feels like he's not taking care of himself and might die young.\n4. The wife doesn't do much, even when asked. She procrastinates and the author ends up doing everything.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nFirst, the wife's mental health is a factor. She's dealing with depression and doesn't want medication. That can affect her ability to contribute. However, even with depression, some level of household help is expected, especially when it's just small tasks. The author is handling everything and is clearly overwhelmed. \n\nBut the key question is whether the author is wrong for expecting more help. The wife is at home all day, so she has the time to help. The husband is working and taking classes, which is a lot. If the wife isn't contributing at all, that's an issue. However, her mental health issues might be a valid reason for her lack of help. \n\nThe husband has tried to give her breaks and understand her situation, but she still doesn't do what's asked. There's a communication problem. He's sending texts, maybe not in the best way. Maybe they need to talk more directly. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? He's not asking for the entire workload, just some help. The wife's depression is a factor, but it's not an excuse for no contribution. The husband is right to feel overburdened. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be struggling with her mental health and not knowing how to ask for support. Maybe the husband isn't approaching her in a way that makes her feel supported. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's reasonable to expect help. However, maybe there's a lack of communication. But the scenario doesn't show that he's made a direct, clear request. He mentions texting reminders, but she's not responding. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband is justified in wanting more help. The wife's depression is a factor, but she's still capable of some tasks. The husband is overworked and right to feel this way. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
