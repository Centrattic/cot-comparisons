She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author is a working dad with two kids, a stay-at-home wife. The wife left her job because she didn't like it and wanted to go back to school. They can't afford daycare, so the wife is at home. The author is doing all the housework, cooking, taking care of the kids, even though the wife is supposed to be home. The wife has depression and doesn't want meds, and when asked to help, she delays or doesn't do things. The author is stressed, not sleeping well, and feels like he's getting out of shape. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is at home, but she has mental health issues. She's in counseling but refuses medication. She's dealing with depression, which can affect her ability to do daily tasks. The author is handling everything, which is a lot, but maybe they didn't discuss expectations before the wife became a stay-at-home parent. The author mentions that he's taking online classes to better his career, adding to his workload. He's not getting enough sleep and is worried about his health.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, he's the one doing all the work. But he's also in a position where he might have expected some shared responsibilities. The wife is home, but her depression might be a valid reason for her not contributing. However, the author could have tried to communicate better with her about his needs. Maybe he hasn't set clear boundaries or discussed how to divide tasks considering her mental health. The wife might also not be communicating her limitations effectively. \n\nThe key points are: the wife is home but not contributing due to depression, and the author is overwhelmed. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting help. It's a tough situation. On one hand, he's doing everything. On the other, the wife has mental health issues. But maybe the author didn't set up a system where responsibilities are shared, even with her condition. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he didn't address the issue earlier or if he's not considering her mental health when assigning tasks. Alternatively, if the wife is aware of his workload and still isn't helping, maybe she's the one at fault. But given that she's dealing with depression, it's a complex situation. \n\nI think the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's clearly overwhelmed and the wife is not fulfilling her role. However, others might argue that he needs to be more understanding of her mental health. But the question is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting help. Since he's the one doing everything and the wife is home, he's not in the wrong for wanting her assistance. However, maybe he could have approached the situation differently, like setting clearer expectations or getting professional help for task management. But overall, the answer might be B.\n"
