She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's dealing with a lot of stress because his wife isn't contributing much around the house. They recently moved, and the wife quit her job to go back to school. They have two young kids, and they can't afford daycare, so she's supposed to be a stay-at-home mom. But she's not doing much around the house, and he's handling almost everything. He's also working, taking online classes, and trying to maintain some health, but he's getting exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the background. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She's in a funk sometimes. The husband is doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare. He's up early, dealing with the kids, and even doing the dishes and laundry. He texts her to remind her of tasks, but she procrastinates. The author feels like he's not taking care of himself, getting only 4-5 hours of sleep, and is worried about his health.\n\nNow, the question is if he's in the wrong. Let's think about the responsibilities. The wife is at home all day, so theoretically, she has time to help. But she has depression, which affects her ability to function. Depression can make even simple tasks overwhelming. The husband is trying to manage work, school, and parenting, which is a lot. However, he's also not asking for help from the wife beyond what she's capable of. There's a balance between recognizing her mental health issues and needing household contributions.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is clearly overburdened. He's doing everything, and it's affecting his health. On the other hand, the wife has a mental health condition that's impacting her ability to contribute. The key here is whether the husband is being unreasonable. He's not saying he wants her to do everything, but that she's not doing her share. The problem might be communication. Have they discussed expectations? It sounds like he's given her tasks, but maybe they need a more structured approach or understanding of her limitations.\n\nAlso, the wife might need more support, not just from a mental health perspective but in terms of dividing responsibilities in a way that's feasible for her current state. The husband's frustration is valid because he's carrying the entire load, but he might need to approach the situation with more empathy for her condition. However, expecting some level of contribution from her is reasonable, especially if she's at home all day. The issue is whether the husband is being unfair or if the wife is unable to meet those expectations due to her depression.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband is not wrong for feeling overwhelmed and needing help. The wife's depression is a significant factor that the husband should consider. However, the wife might need more encouragement or a different approach to take on even small tasks. The husband could be doing more to understand her situation, but he's also justified in wanting support for household chores. The answer might hinge on whether the husband's expectations are realistic given the wife's mental health. If the wife is truly unable to help due to her condition, then the husband might need to adjust his expectations. But if she's capable of doing some basic tasks and isn't, then the husband is not in the wrong for wanting her help.\n"
