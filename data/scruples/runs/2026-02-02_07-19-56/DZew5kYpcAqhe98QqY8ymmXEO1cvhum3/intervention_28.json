She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. The situation involves a lot of responsibilities on the husband's side, with the wife not contributing as much. \n\nFirst, the wife quit her job to go back to school and also has depression, which they mention she's in counseling for. She doesn't take meds. The husband does most of the chores, childcare, and even his own work and online classes. He's getting only 4-5 hours of sleep because of the 1-year-old. The wife is described as not doing anything around the house, making excuses, and not following through even when asked. The husband feels overwhelmed and is worried about his health.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The wife is at home all day with the kids, but isn't helping. The husband is taking on all the work, which is leading to stress and lack of self-care. He mentions wanting help but not getting it. The key points here are the wife's mental health issues and the husband's expectations.\n\nOn one hand, the wife has depression, which can affect her ability to contribute. The husband is trying to support her by giving her breaks and understanding her condition. But on the other hand, the husband is clearly overburdened and needs more help. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to do more.\n\nI think the answer hinges on communication and mutual effort. If the husband has discussed his needs with her and she's still not contributing, maybe there's a breakdown in communication or understanding her limitations. However, the wife's depression might be a legitimate barrier. But the husband is also not taking care of himself, which could be a result of not setting boundaries or her not responding to requests.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess if that's accurate. Is the husband's demand for help unreasonable? He's working, taking classes, and managing everything else. If the wife isn't able to help due to her mental health, maybe the husband isn't wrong for feeling overwhelmed. However, if he hasn't effectively communicated his needs or is not being supportive enough of her situation, that could be where he's at fault.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's mental health is a factor, the husband's situation is valid. If he's making reasonable requests and she's not responding despite her condition, he's not in the wrong for wanting help. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
