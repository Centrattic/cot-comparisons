She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. The background story is pretty detailed. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the wife left her job to go back to school. They have two kids, a 1.5-year-old not in daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression and is in counseling but not on meds. The author is handling all the chores, cooking, cleaning, laundry, taking care of the kids before work, etc. The wife isn't contributing much, and the author is stressed and overworked, even affecting his health because he can't find time to work out. He's also in online classes for his career.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is wrong for expecting help. Let me think about the dynamics here. The wife is at home, so in theory, she has the time to help. But she has depression, which might affect her ability to take on tasks. The author mentions she gets into moods where everything is a struggle. He's trying to support her by giving her breaks from the kids, but she's not reciprocating with household help.\n\nOn one hand, the author is doing everything and feeling overwhelmed. On the other, the wife has mental health challenges. Is it fair to expect her to take on more when she's struggling? The key here is communication. The author says he's told her he feels like he might die young due to stress and not taking care of himself. But has he discussed this with her in a way that's constructive?\n\nAlso, the wife's depression is a factor. She might not be able to contribute as much as he hopes, despite her time being free. The author might be underestimating the impact of her mental health on her ability to manage household tasks. Maybe he's not approaching the situation with enough empathy, or maybe he hasn't found a compromise that works for both.\n\nAnother angle: The author is handling all the childcare and chores. The wife is at home, but perhaps the expectations are unrealistic given her mental health. The author is in a tough position, but maybe he's not considering that she's dealing with her own issues. Or maybe he is, but he's at a breaking point and needs support.\n\nIs it the author's fault for expecting more? Or is the wife's depression the main barrier here? The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not communicating effectively or isn't being understanding of her condition, then maybe he's at fault. But if he's making reasonable requests and she's not meeting them despite her mental health, then maybe she's not contributing as she should.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is considering her mental health when he's making demands. If he's being reasonable and she's still not helping, maybe she's the one not pulling her weight. But if he's not acknowledging her struggles and is being overly critical, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nThe author mentions that he's trying to give her breaks, but she still doesn't do the tasks. Maybe he needs to approach this with more empathy, set clear expectations, or seek couples counseling. The fact that he's texting her to remind her and she's not doing it suggests that maybe she's overwhelmed or can't manage the tasks. But he's also not taking care of himself, which is a red flag.\n\nIn terms of fairness, expecting a stay-at-home parent to help with chores is standard. The problem is the wife's depression. If the author isn't addressing this aspect, maybe he's not being supportive. But he's also overworked. It's a tough situation. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's asking for help in a reasonable situation, but the wife's mental health is complicating things. Alternatively, if the author isn't being empathetic, maybe A (in the wrong). \n\nI think the key is that the author is not necessarily in the wrong for expecting help, but the way he's handling it might be. However, given the information, the wife's mental health is a significant factor. The author might need to adjust his approach, but the initial request for help isn't unreasonable. So perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
