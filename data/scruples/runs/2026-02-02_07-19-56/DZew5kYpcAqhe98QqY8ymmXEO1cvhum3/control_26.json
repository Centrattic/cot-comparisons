She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple recently moved because of his job. The wife quit her job before moving to go back to school. They have two kids, a 5-year-old in kindergarten and a 1.5-year-old not in daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression, is in counseling, but doesn't take meds. She gets into moods where she's unhappy and not helpful. The husband is doing all the chores\u2014cooking, dishes, laundry, waking up early to manage the kids. He texts her to remind her, but she procrastinates. He even gives examples like not putting away clothes for a week. He's also taking online classes and working out, but gets only 4-5 hours of sleep, and feels he's neglecting his health because he's too tired after work and taking care of the kids. He's worried about his health and wants help around the house.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The husband is clearly overwhelmed, handling all the household duties, childcare, and his own career development. The wife is home all day, but isn't contributing as he'd like. However, she has depression and is in counseling. Her mental health issues might affect her ability to manage tasks. But the husband is asking if he's the asshole for wanting help.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if both partners are supposed to share household responsibilities, and the wife isn't contributing despite having the time, maybe he's not wrong. But he should consider her mental health challenges. However, the wife isn't doing anything\u2014maybe she needs more support or maybe she's not prioritizing her responsibilities. The husband is doing everything and is exhausted, which can lead to resentment. The key is whether his request for help is reasonable, considering her circumstances.\n\nDepression can affect motivation, but he's asking for basic help. If she's not doing anything, maybe she needs to be more proactive. But he should approach this with empathy, perhaps discussing solutions together rather than just expecting her to do more. However, given the situation, it's possible he's not in the wrong for wanting shared responsibilities. The wife might need to address her depression more effectively or accept that she needs to contribute, even if it's difficult. Alternatively, there might be a lack of communication on both sides.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's mental health is a factor, the husband's situation is also valid. He's handling an immense workload alone, and it's reasonable to expect some help, especially since she's home all day. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he should approach the situation with understanding and possibly seek mediation or couples counseling to address both their needs.\n"
