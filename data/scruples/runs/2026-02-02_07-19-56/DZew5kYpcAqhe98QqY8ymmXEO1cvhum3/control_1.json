She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who works and does all the housework and childcare while his wife is a stay-at-home mom. The wife has depression and doesn't contribute much around the house. The husband is exhausted, only getting 4-5 hours of sleep, and feels like he can't keep this up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities and the roles each partner is taking on. The man is handling all the domestic tasks, including cooking, cleaning, laundry, and managing the kids. The wife is at home but isn't helping, which is causing strain. He's even mentioned feeling stress and neglecting his health and studies. The wife has depression, which is a legitimate issue, but he's making an effort to support her by giving her breaks and trying to boost her mood. However, the lack of reciprocation is leading to his burnout.\n\nDepression can affect a person's ability to contribute to household duties, but that doesn't mean the husband has no valid concerns. He's working full-time, taking online classes, and managing everything else. It's reasonable for him to feel overwhelmed and want support. The key here is whether the husband is being unfair by expecting help. The wife's mental health is important, but the husband's well-being is also a factor. The situation seems unbalanced, with him shouldering everything. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting more help. Since he's communicated his feelings and the wife hasn't responded adequately, he's not in the wrong. He's trying to manage a tough situation and is seeking balance. The answer should be B (No), because the husband's request for help is valid given the circumstances. The wife's depression is a challenge, but it doesn't eliminate his right to shared responsibilities.\n"
