She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who's doing all the household chores and caring for the kids, while his wife, who's a stay-at-home mom, isn't helping. The wife has depression and isn't on medication, but she's in counseling. The husband feels overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help around the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a marriage, especially when one partner is working and the other is not. The wife quit her job to go back to school, but childcare is too expensive. So she's at home, but not contributing to chores. The husband is handling everything: cooking, cleaning, laundry, waking up early, managing the kids, etc. He's also taking online classes and trying to work out but can't because of exhaustion. He mentions feeling stressed and possibly dying young from the stress. The wife, despite being at home, isn't doing her share. Her excuses are that she'll do things \"later,\" which never happens, and even simple tasks like putting away clothes take a week.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting more help. The key points here are the distribution of household responsibilities, the wife's mental health, and communication. The husband has tried to give her breaks, but it's not working. He's communicated his feelings to her, but she's not responding. \n\nIn most relationships, both partners are expected to contribute to household chores, even if one is not working outside the home. The wife's depression might affect her ability to help, but she's in counseling. It's possible she's not getting the help she needs, but the husband is still responsible for his own well-being. The husband is clearly overburdened, and expecting some help is reasonable. The wife being at home all day should have time to do chores. The fact that she's not doing it despite being asked repeatedly suggests a lack of cooperation. \n\nThe husband's stress and health concerns are valid. If he's not taking care of himself, it could lead to serious issues. The wife might need to be more proactive in seeking help for her depression, or they might need to adjust their living situation. The husband is not being unreasonable in wanting support. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's asking for help in a fair and reasonable way, and the wife isn't meeting her responsibilities.\n"
