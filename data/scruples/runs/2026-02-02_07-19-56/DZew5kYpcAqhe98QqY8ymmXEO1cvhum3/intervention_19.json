She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife who isn't contributing much to household chores, and the husband is overwhelmed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is handling most of the domestic work, including cooking, cleaning, childcare, and even his own studies and work. He's getting very little sleep and feels stressed. The wife has depression and isn't taking medication, but she's still supposed to be managing the household. She's at home all day, but according to the husband, she doesn't do much. \n\nThe wife's perspective isn't fully detailed. She has mental health issues, which can affect her ability to contribute. The husband mentions she's in counseling and dealing with depression, which might explain her lack of involvement. But he's also not communicating effectively, maybe? He texts her to remind her of tasks, and when she doesn't do them, he ends up doing it all. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual effort. The husband is clearly overwhelmed, but maybe he hasn't sat down with his wife to address this in a non-confrontational way. If the wife is struggling with depression, maybe she needs more support or a different approach to shared responsibilities. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is doing everything else, including taking care of the kids and his career. It's unrealistic to expect him to handle all the chores and childcare alone without any help. The wife might need to take some steps, even small ones, to contribute. But given her mental health, it's a complex situation. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? If he hasn't discussed this with her in a constructive manner, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, expecting a spouse with depression to do more without considering her mental state might be part of the issue. The husband's health is also a concern, so he's not wrong to seek balance. \n\nBut the wife's lack of contribution is a problem. However, the husband might not have addressed it in a way that considers her mental health. So maybe the problem is a communication breakdown rather than one person being in the wrong entirely. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband has tried to work with his wife to find a solution that accommodates her mental health while still ensuring household tasks are shared. If he hasn't, then maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. If he has and she's still not contributing, then perhaps she's the one at fault. But based on the info given, the husband is doing most of the work and expressing his stress, so I lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
