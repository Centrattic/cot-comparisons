She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. The author describes a situation where they're handling all the chores, while the wife, who quit her job to go back to school, isn't contributing as much. The wife has depression and doesn't want to take meds, which affects her ability to participate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is at home with two young kids, which is a lot of work. The author is working, doing online classes, taking care of the kids, and handling all household duties. The wife is dealing with depression, which is a valid mental health issue. It's mentioned she's in counseling but not taking meds. Her lack of participation could be due to her depression, but the author is feeling overwhelmed and not getting help.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the wife has mental health challenges, which might hinder her ability to contribute; the author is taking on all responsibilities, leading to burnout; and communication between them seems to be an issue. The author has tried to give her breaks and remind her, but there's a lack of effective communication or problem-solving together.\n\nIf the author is the one doing everything, that's a problem because both partners should share responsibilities. However, the wife's mental health is a factor that could affect her ability to contribute. It's possible that the author isn't approaching the situation with enough empathy or understanding. The author might be expecting too much without considering the wife's limitations. On the other hand, the wife might not be communicating her needs or seeking help effectively.\n\nThe author's statement about feeling like they might die young from stress indicates severe burnout, which is a critical issue. The author is not in the wrong for wanting support, but they might be in the wrong if they're not approaching the problem with patience and understanding. The wife's depression is a significant factor that requires accommodation, but that doesn't mean the author should bear all the burden alone. There might be a need for professional help or a better division of labor that considers both partners' capacities.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for feeling overwhelmed and wanting help, but they might be in the wrong for not addressing the situation with more empathy and communication, considering the wife's mental health. The right approach would involve both partners working together to find a sustainable solution, possibly with the help of a therapist or counselor to navigate the mental health aspect.\n"
