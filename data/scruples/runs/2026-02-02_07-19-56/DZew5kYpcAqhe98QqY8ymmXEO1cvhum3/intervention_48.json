She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author has a stay-at-home wife who quit her job to go back to school, but she's not contributing much to household chores. He feels overwhelmed with taking care of the kids and the house since he's working and doing online classes. He's getting about 4-5 hours of sleep a night because of the 1-year-old waking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. Her not doing chores is part of her struggle with depression. The author is trying to manage everything on his own, leading to stress and lack of self-care. He's asking if it's his fault for wanting help, even though she's at home all day.\n\nNow, evaluating both sides. The author is clearly overburdened. The wife's inattentiveness to chores might be due to her mental health issues. But he's expressing his needs and feeling that he can't sustain this alone. The key here is communication. The author has tried to give her breaks, but she's still not helping. He's texting her to remind, but she doesn't act. The example of the clothes basket shows neglect over a week.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's not asking for something unreasonable. He's doing all the housework and childcare, which is a lot. The wife may have valid reasons (depression), but the author has a right to expect some support, especially since she's at home. However, he needs to approach it with empathy and possibly involve her in the solution, rather than just expecting her to do tasks. But the main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting help. I don't think he is. The problem might be the wife's lack of action despite his efforts and her mental health issues. The author is trying to balance work, studies, and family, which is a heavy load. So, the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance where he should address it more constructively. Still, the core issue is his valid request for support, so I'll go with B.\n"
