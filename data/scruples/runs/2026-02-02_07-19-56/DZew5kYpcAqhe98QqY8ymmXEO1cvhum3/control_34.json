She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. The situation involves a lot of factors, so I need to consider them carefully.\n\nFirst, the wife quit her job to go back to school because she didn't enjoy her job and to avoid daycare costs. They have two kids, which already adds a lot of stress. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She gets into moods where she's unhappy and not functioning well. The husband is handling all the household chores, cooking, childcare, and even his own work and online classes. He's getting very little sleep and feels overwhelmed, leading to stress and a fear of health issues.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's mental health and the unequal distribution of household responsibilities. The husband is doing everything, which is unsustainable. The question is whether his wanting help makes him the asshole.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife is at home all day, but she has mental health challenges. Her depression might be affecting her ability to contribute, even if she wants to. The husband is taking on an enormous load, but he's also not getting support. The wife might need more understanding and encouragement rather than being scolded for not contributing. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the way he's handling it might be part of the problem. Instead of just doing everything himself and texting her to do tasks, maybe he should be communicating more effectively about his needs and working together to find a solution. The wife might need more support and perhaps professional help beyond counseling if her depression is affecting her ability to manage daily tasks. But the husband also has the right to not be overburdened. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting help, but the way he's approaching the issue might need adjustment. The wife's mental health is a significant factor here, so it's not just about being lazy. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
