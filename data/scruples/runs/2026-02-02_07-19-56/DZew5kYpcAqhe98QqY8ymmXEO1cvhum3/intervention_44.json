She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a working parent with two kids, and their wife is a stay-at-home mom. The wife has depression and isn't contributing much to household tasks. The author is handling most of the chores, cooking, childcare, and even managing their own classes and workouts. They feel overwhelmed and are asking if it's their fault for expecting help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife left her job because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. They can't afford daycare, so she's home with the kids. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses meds. She's supposed to be taking care of the kids, but according to the author, she's not doing much around the house. The author feels like they're doing everything, leading to stress and lack of self-care.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the wife is dealing with mental health issues, which can impact her ability to manage daily tasks. Depression can make even simple tasks feel overwhelming. The author is doing a lot, but maybe they're not considering the wife's mental state. On the other hand, the author is taking on a disproportionate share of the workload, which isn't fair. They're working, taking classes, and managing everything else, leading to burnout.\n\nI need to balance these factors. The wife's depression is a significant factor here. If she's in counseling, maybe she's working on it, but it's a process. The author might need to communicate better, perhaps set smaller, manageable tasks for the wife. But the author also has a right to expect some help, especially since the wife is home all day. The key is whether the author's expectations are reasonable given her circumstances.\n\nThe author mentions texting reminders, but the wife isn't following through. Maybe there's a need for more structured communication or understanding that the wife's depression is preventing her from contributing. However, the author's stress and health are also valid concerns. They can't sustain this level of work without support. The answer hinges on whether the wife's mental health issues are being adequately addressed and if the author is giving her enough support and understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's stress is understandable, expecting a partner with depression to contribute equally might not be feasible without additional support or treatment. The author might need to seek a balance between self-care and supporting the wife's mental health, possibly through couples counseling or other resources. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both parties to adjust their expectations and communication.\n"
