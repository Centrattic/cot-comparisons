She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a working parent with two kids, and their wife is a stay-at-home mom who they feel isn't contributing enough at home. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the background. The wife quit her job to go back to school and because she didn't like her job. They have two kids, a 1-year-old not in daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. The author is doing almost all the chores, cooking, cleaning, laundry, managing the kids, and even working on online classes. He's getting about 4-5 hours of sleep because the 1-year-old wakes up at night. He's feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and not taking care of himself because he's too busy doing everything.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help. His wife isn't doing much around the house, and he's having to remind her repeatedly, but the tasks aren't getting done. He's also concerned about his health and career. \n\nNow, considering the wife's mental health, she's dealing with depression. That's a significant factor. People with depression can have symptoms that make it hard to complete daily tasks. The author mentions she gets into funks where she's unhappy and nothing is right. He's trying to support her by giving her breaks from the kids, but she still isn't contributing. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is taking on an enormous workload. He's handling all the domestic responsibilities, the kids, his job, and online classes. He's not getting enough sleep and is neglecting his own health. It's possible that he's feeling resentful because he's doing everything. \n\nThe key points here are mutual support and communication. The wife is dealing with depression, which is a valid issue, but the author is also struggling under the weight of responsibilities. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting more help. Since the wife isn't contributing despite the author's efforts to support her, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for needing assistance. However, there's also the aspect of communication. Has the author tried to discuss this openly with his wife, perhaps setting boundaries or seeking couples counseling? The post mentions he's tried reminding her, but maybe a more structured approach is needed. \n\nBut based on the information given, the author is clearly overwhelmed and the wife isn't pulling her weight, even with his understanding of her depression. The author's well-being is also important. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, it's a complex situation where both parties have challenges. The author's needs for support are valid, and the wife's mental health is a factor. But given the circumstances, the author isn't necessarily the asshole for wanting help.\n"
