She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The wife quit her job before moving because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, one in kindergarten and the other 1.5 years old. Daycare is too expensive, so the wife is staying home. She has depression and is in counseling but doesn't take medication. The author is doing all the housework\u2014cooking, dishes, laundry, taking care of the kids, even before the wife wakes up. He's also working and taking online classes, getting only 4-5 hours of sleep. The wife isn't helping much; when asked, she delays tasks, and he ends up doing everything. He feels stressed, not taking care of himself, and worries about his health.\n\nSo the question is, is the author the asshole for wanting help? The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about this.\n\nThe wife is dealing with depression, which can affect her motivation and ability to contribute. The author is taking on a massive workload, not just work but also all childcare and housework. He's even sacrificing his own self-care (like working out) and is concerned about his health. He's communicated his feelings to his wife. \n\nOn one hand, the wife has a valid mental health issue. Depression can make it hard to manage daily tasks. The author might not be considering her mental state fully. On the other hand, he's doing everything and feeling overwhelmed, which is understandable. The balance here is tricky. \n\nBut wait, the author is asking if he's in the wrong. If the wife has depression, expecting her to do more might be unrealistic unless there's support. However, the author isn't seeking help or adjusting expectations. He's doing everything and feeling like he might die young from stress. Maybe the issue is that he's not addressing the underlying problem\u2014maybe he should involve a therapist or counselor to help them communicate better. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is the one doing all the work and feeling overwhelmed. The wife isn't contributing, and he's the one who's trying to take care of everyone else. So in terms of fairness, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's the one carrying the load. However, he might not be approaching it in the healthiest way. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the wife has a mental health issue, maybe there's some responsibility on the author to accommodate that. But he's also being asked to do everything. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because he's taking on all the responsibilities, communicating his feelings, and the wife isn't contributing. However, there might be a need for better communication or professional help. But in terms of right or wrong, he's the one trying to manage everything and is feeling the strain. So he's not the asshole here.\n"
