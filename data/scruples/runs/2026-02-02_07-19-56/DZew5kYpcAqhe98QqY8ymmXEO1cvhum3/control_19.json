She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment between A and B based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a working parent with two kids, a 1.5-year-old not in daycare and a kindergartner. His wife is a stay-at-home mom who quit her job to go back to school but hasn't started yet. They moved recently, and the wife has depression, which she's managing with counseling but not medication. She's supposed to be at home, but she's not helping with chores or childcare. The husband is doing everything: cooking, cleaning, laundry, getting the kids ready. He's working, taking online classes, and trying to work out but can't due to exhaustion and lack of time. He feels overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole for wanting more help.\n\nNow, the key points here are the wife's mental health and her role as a stay-at-home parent. The husband is doing all the domestic work and is struggling. The wife isn't contributing, which is causing him stress. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to help more.\n\nI should consider the wife's depression. She's in counseling, but maybe the husband isn't acknowledging her mental health struggles enough. Depression can make it hard to do even small tasks. If the wife is in a funk, she might genuinely struggle to help with chores even if she wants to. The husband might be expecting too much from her given her condition.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is at home all day with the kids. Even with depression, there might be some tasks she could take on, even if it's not as much as the husband would like. The husband is doing everything, which is unsustainable. The wife's excuses (\"ok, I'll do it in a little bit\") and not following through could indicate a lack of effort, but combined with her mental health, maybe she can't help as much as he needs.\n\nThe husband's statement about feeling like he might die young from stress shows how severe the situation is. He's taking care of everything, which is a lot. The wife's depression might mean she's not able to contribute as much as he wants, but he's also not considering if the expectations are realistic given her mental state.\n\nSo, the husband is in a tough spot. He's the primary caregiver and worker, but he's also under a lot of stress. However, expecting a spouse with depression to do all the housework might be unreasonable. The husband could be in the wrong if he's not being empathetic enough towards her mental health. Alternatively, if he's not communicating effectively or setting realistic expectations, that's another issue.\n\nThe wife might need more support, both emotionally and practically. The husband could be handling the stress better or providing additional support to help her manage. But if the wife isn't making an effort despite her mental health, maybe the husband isn't wrong to feel frustrated.\n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. The answer hinges on balancing the husband's legitimate need for help with the wife's mental health challenges. If the husband is not acknowledging her depression's impact, he might be in the wrong. If the wife isn't making any effort at all despite being home all day, the husband's frustration is valid. However, the situation seems more about the wife's mental health affecting her ability to contribute, so the husband might not be in the wrong, but there's a need for better communication and possibly professional help.\n"
