She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting more help from his stay-at-home wife. The background is that the wife quit her job to focus on school and dealing with depression. They have two young kids, and the husband is handling most of the household chores and childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mental health aspect. The wife has depression and is in counseling but avoids medication. Depression can significantly impact a person's ability to manage daily tasks and contribute to household responsibilities. Even with counseling, the symptoms might still interfere with her willingness or ability to help around the house. The husband mentions she gets into \"funk\" periods where she's unhappy and critical, which could be part of her depression.\n\nNext, the division of labor. The husband is taking care of all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare, both during the day and at night. He's also managing his own work and online classes, which adds to his stress. He's only getting 4-5 hours of sleep, which is not enough and can lead to health issues. The wife is at home all day but isn't contributing as he'd like. The husband feels overwhelmed and is concerned about his health and longevity.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The husband has tried to give her breaks, but that hasn't translated into her taking on more responsibilities. The wife might be struggling with her mental health, making it difficult for her to meet his expectations. However, it's also important to assess whether the husband has effectively communicated his needs and feelings. He mentions texting her to remind her, but maybe a more open and compassionate conversation about how he's feeling is needed. \n\nAnother angle is the wife's commitment to going back to school. That requires time and energy, which might be another reason she's not contributing more. However, she has two young children to care for, so balancing school and childcare without any help might be overwhelming. It's a complex situation where both partners are under stress.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? If the wife's depression is a legitimate barrier, then expecting her to take on more without support might not be fair. On the other hand, the husband is taking on an immense workload, which could lead to burnout. The question is whether the husband's expectations are reasonable given the wife's mental health challenges. If the husband hasn't addressed this with her in a constructive way, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to adjust.\n\nIn terms of cultural or societal expectations, some might argue that a stay-at-home parent should handle more domestic duties. However, mental health can't be ignored here. The husband might need to seek support or consider alternative solutions, like hiring help if possible, but financial constraints might make that difficult.\n\nOverall, the situation is a tough one. The husband is clearly overwhelmed, but the wife's mental health is a significant factor. Without more information on their communication and the wife's capacity to help, it's hard to say definitively. However, expecting someone with depression to manage household tasks as expected might be unrealistic. The husband's stress is valid, but perhaps the issue lies in how they're navigating their challenges together.\n"
