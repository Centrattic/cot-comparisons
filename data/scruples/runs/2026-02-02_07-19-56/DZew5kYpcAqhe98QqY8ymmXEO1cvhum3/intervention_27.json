She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author and his wife moved recently for his job. The wife didn't enjoy her job and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, and they don't use daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression, is in counseling but doesn't want meds. She's supposed to stay home, but she doesn't help with chores. The author does all the cooking, dishes, laundry, gets up early to take care of the kids before work, and even handles tasks during the day. He texts her to remind her, but she doesn't do things. He mentions the load is too much, not sleeping enough, and he's trying to take care of himself but can't. He's worried about his health and feels he might die young from the stress.\n\nSo, the question is: Is he in the wrong for wanting help around the house?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is at home all day, but she's dealing with depression. She might have mental health challenges that affect her ability to contribute. The author, on the other hand, is working, taking online classes, and handling all the domestic responsibilities. He's clearly overwhelmed.\n\nBut does that mean he's in the wrong? Well, wanting help isn't inherently wrong. However, the wife has her own issues. The author hasn't mentioned trying to have a serious conversation about the household responsibilities. He says he's told her he feels stressed, but maybe there's a communication gap. He might be assuming she can do more without considering how her depression is affecting her capacity.\n\nAlso, the wife quit her job to go back to school, which could be time-consuming. If she's focusing on her studies, maybe that's why she's not contributing. But on the other hand, she's at home, so even if she's studying, some household tasks could be shared. The key here is whether the author has communicated his needs effectively and whether the wife's mental health is a factor that limits her ability to help.\n\nAnother angle: the author is taking care of everything and not taking care of his own health. He's only getting 4-5 hours of sleep and not working out. That's a problem, but it's his own responsibility to prioritize self-care. However, the situation is unsustainable if he's doing everything alone.\n\nIs he in the wrong? If the wife isn't contributing due to valid mental health reasons, and the author hasn't addressed this in a supportive way, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's not acknowledging her struggles and expecting her to do more without understanding, maybe he is. The question is about wanting help. Wanting help isn't wrong, but the approach might be. If he hasn't communicated effectively or considered her situation, that could be part of the problem. But given the details, it seems like he's clearly overwhelmed and she's not helping. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because he's asking for support, which is reasonable. However, the wife's mental health is a factor, but the author might need to approach it differently, but that doesn't mean he's in the wrong for wanting help.\n"
