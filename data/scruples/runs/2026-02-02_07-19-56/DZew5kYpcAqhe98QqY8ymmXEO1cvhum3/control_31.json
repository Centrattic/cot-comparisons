She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband is taking care of all the household chores and childcare while his wife, who is a stay-at-home mom, isn't contributing as he'd like. The wife has depression, is in counseling, and the couple moved due to his job. The kids are young, and they can't afford daycare because it's too expensive. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's mental health. She has depression and is in counseling, which might affect her ability to manage household tasks. Depression can make even simple tasks feel overwhelming, so maybe she's trying but struggling. The husband mentions she has funks where she's unhappy, which could be part of her depression.\n\nThen there's the dynamic of their situation. The wife left her job to go back to school, but maybe she hasn't started yet? They moved recently, so maybe she's adjusting to a new environment. The husband is working and taking online classes, which adds to his stress. He's also handling all the childcare, which is a lot. He's getting very little sleep and is worried about his health.\n\nThe husband is asking for help, which is reasonable. He's doing everything alone and feeling overwhelmed. The wife isn't doing her share, but is it because of her depression? The husband is trying to be understanding by giving her breaks from the kids, but when he asks her to do chores, she delays. The example with the clothes sitting for a week is a clear instance of not following through.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? He's not being cruel; he's expressing his need for help. The wife might need more support or structure. Maybe communication isn't effective. The husband has tried to explain his feelings, but maybe they need to find a better way to work together. However, the wife's mental health is a factor here. If she's unable to contribute due to depression, that's a medical issue she's dealing with. The husband might need to adjust expectations or seek professional help for their communication issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is taking on all the responsibilities, which is unsustainable. A partnership in a marriage usually means sharing responsibilities. If the wife is staying home but not contributing, it's fair for the husband to ask for help. But considering her depression, maybe he should explore other support systems, like temporary help or counseling for them both.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't wrong for wanting help. It's a reasonable expectation in a marriage. However, how he's handling it matters. If he's respectful and communicates effectively, he's in the right. But if he's being harsh or dismissive of her mental health, that's an issue. From his description, he seems to be trying to be understanding but is reaching his breaking point. The key is whether he's making valid requests for support while considering her situation.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because it's reasonable to expect help in a marriage. However, there's a need for better communication and possibly professional support to address the wife's mental health and their household dynamics.\n"
