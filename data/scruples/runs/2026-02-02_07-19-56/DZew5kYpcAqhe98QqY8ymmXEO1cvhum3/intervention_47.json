She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a working parent with two young kids, taking online classes, and doing all the household chores. Their wife stayed home, quit her job, and is dealing with depression. The author feels overwhelmed and is asking if it's their fault for expecting help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife has mental health issues, including depression, which can affect her ability to manage daily tasks. The author mentions she's in counseling but refuses medication. Her depression might contribute to her not contributing to household chores. The author is handling everything else\u2014work, kids, chores, and even school. They're getting very little sleep and feel they're on the verge of burnout.\n\nThe key points are: the wife's mental health, the author's contributions, and the imbalance in responsibilities. The author is seeking help, which is reasonable, but the wife's depression might be a barrier. However, the author should have addressed this earlier. Perhaps they didn't set clear expectations or communicate their needs effectively. The author might be taking on too much without support from their partner, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong. Both partners should collaborate, especially when there are children involved. However, if the wife is genuinely unable to help due to her mental health, the author might need professional help or to adjust expectations. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but they might be expecting more from their wife than what's feasible given her condition. It's possible they didn't address this issue constructively. However, wanting help isn't wrong. The problem might be in how they're communicating their needs or the wife's lack of response. Considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting help, but the situation highlights communication and mental health challenges that need addressing through counseling or other support systems. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but with the caveat that both need to work on communication and support.\n"
