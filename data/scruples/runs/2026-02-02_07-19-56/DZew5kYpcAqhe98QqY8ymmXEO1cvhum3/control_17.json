She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to contribute more around the house. \n\nFirst, the background: The wife left her job to go back to school and take care of the kids. They have two children, which can be a lot. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. The author is handling all the chores, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare. He's also working and taking online classes, which is adding to his stress. He's sleep-deprived and feels like he's getting out of shape because he doesn't have time for exercise.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's mental health and the author's workload. The wife is managing her depression without meds, which might affect her ability to contribute. The author is stretched thin with work, studies, and childcare. He's asking for help with household tasks, but she's not doing them, leading to resentment.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and fairness, it's common for both partners to share responsibilities, but when one partner is dealing with mental health issues, it's more complex. The author is clearly overwhelmed. However, the wife isn't contributing, which the author has communicated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting help.\n\nBut wait, the wife is a stay-at-home mom with two young kids. Her main responsibilities are the children, and maybe she's using her depression as an excuse. The author is taking on everything else, which is unsustainable. The wife's counselor might be a better resource for her to address her mental health and responsibilities. The author has a right to feel overburdened, and the wife's lack of action is contributing to the problem.\n\nIs the author being unfair? He's not expecting her to work a job, but basic household tasks. The wife's excuse is always \"later,\" which isn't working. The author has communicated his needs, and she's not meeting them. That seems like a valid reason for him to feel wronged. However, her depression might affect her ability to help, but she's in counseling, so maybe she can manage some tasks.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if both partners are contributing as much as they can, given their circumstances, then it's balanced. The author is doing everything, and the wife is doing nothing beyond childcare. That seems imbalanced. The author isn't wrong for wanting support. The wife's mental health is a factor, but she's not making an effort despite being asked. So the author is justified in feeling that he's the one carrying the load. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
