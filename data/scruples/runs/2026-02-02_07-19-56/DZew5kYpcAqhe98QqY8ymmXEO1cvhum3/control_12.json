She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife who isn't contributing equally to household chores, leading to the husband taking on most responsibilities. \n\nFirst, the husband's background: he's working and taking online classes, while his wife is dealing with depression and not working but also not helping around the house. The wife has two young kids, and they moved recently. The husband is doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare. He's getting very little sleep and feels overwhelmed, even worried about his health.\n\nThe wife has a mental health issue (depression) and is in counseling. She doesn't take meds and sometimes gets into moods where she's unhappy. The husband tries to support her by giving her breaks but feels she's not pulling her weight at home. He's even doing tasks like sorting laundry and putting away clothes, which she neglects. \n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting help. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband is working full-time, studying, and handling all household duties. He's getting insufficient sleep and is concerned about his health. On the other hand, the wife has depression and might not be able to contribute as much. However, depression doesn't absolve someone from all responsibilities, especially if it's manageable with therapy. But it's also a legitimate health issue that affects her ability to function.\n\nThe husband's expectations might be reasonable. Even with depression, there should be some effort to share basic chores. He's not asking for equality but for help. The wife's excuses like \"I'll do it later\" and not doing tasks even when asked directly suggest she's not fulfilling her role, which is understandable given her mental health, but perhaps she's not seeking enough help or making an effort.\n\nThe key points here are communication, understanding, and the balance between mental health and household responsibilities. The husband has tried to support her, but the lack of reciprocation is causing him significant stress. The wife might need to address her depression more actively, maybe with meds if counseling isn't enough. However, the husband is also in a position where he's overburdened and needs support. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband isn't wrong for feeling overwhelmed. He's trying to maintain a balanced life but is struggling. The wife's depression is a factor, but if she's not engaging in any tasks despite being able to sit on the couch with the clothes nearby, it's a problem. The husband's request for help is valid. So, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
