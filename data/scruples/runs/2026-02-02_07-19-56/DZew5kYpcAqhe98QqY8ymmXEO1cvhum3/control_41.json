She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife who isn't helping with household chores despite being at home all day, and the husband is overwhelmed with work, kids, and his own studies. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife quit her job to go back to school, but daycare is too expensive, so she's not working. She has depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. She's supposed to be at home with the kids, but the husband is handling all the chores, cooking, cleaning, and childcare. He's getting very little sleep, stressed, and even mentions not taking care of his health because he's too busy.\n\nThe main issue here is the division of labor. The husband feels he's carrying the entire load, which is causing him stress and health concerns. The wife, on the other hand, isn't contributing to household tasks, even small ones. She's in a funk a lot, but the husband is doing everything. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the wife has mental health issues, which need to be considered. But she's at home all day, and the husband is working and going to school. The wife's lack of contribution is adding to his stress. The husband is trying to communicate by texting and asking her to do things, but she's not following through. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's reasonable for the husband to expect some help, especially since she's not working. However, considering her depression, it's important to approach this with empathy. But the husband is clearly overwhelmed. The question is whether his expectation for help is unreasonable. \n\nThe wife might have personal struggles, but the husband is also dealing with a lot. The fact that he's trying to manage everything on his own and is worried about his health suggests that he's not the asshole here. The wife's refusal to take on even small tasks, despite being at home, is contributing to the problem. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. He's asking for help in a fair division of labor, and the wife's failure to contribute is the issue, not his expectation.\n"
