She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a husband who's working and taking online classes, and his wife is a stay-at-home mom with two kids. The wife has depression and isn't doing much around the house, while the husband is handling all the chores, childcare, and his own responsibilities. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting her to contribute more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife quit her job to go back to school because she didn't like her job and they couldn't afford daycare because it's too expensive. She's also dealing with depression and is in counseling but refuses medication. Her lack of participation in household chores is a problem for the husband, who's handling everything else.\n\nNow, the husband is doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare. He's getting very little sleep, only 4-5 hours a night, and he's trying to maintain his career and take classes. He's exhausted and feels he's neglecting his health because there's no time for exercise. He's been asking his wife to help, but she keeps procrastinating. The husband is stressed and feels he might die young because of the stress and lack of self-care.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's clearly overwhelmed and trying to balance a lot. He's communicated his needs to his wife, but she's not responding. The wife has a mental health condition that might be affecting her ability to contribute. However, depression doesn't necessarily excuse a complete lack of contribution, but it's a factor to consider.\n\nThe husband is asking for help, which is reasonable. In a marriage, especially with stay-at-home parents, sharing responsibilities is important. The wife is at home all day, so she should have the capacity to do some tasks. But given her depression, maybe she's struggling to even get up and do basic things. However, the husband is doing everything, which is unsustainable.\n\nI think the key here is that the husband is doing all the work and not getting the support he needs. Even if his wife has depression, there might be things she can do, even if it's not perfect. The husband should probably communicate more effectively, maybe set specific expectations, or seek couples counseling. But in terms of being in the wrong, he's not the one who's not contributing. The wife isn't helping, so he's the one trying to hold everything together. Therefore, the husband isn't the asshole here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
