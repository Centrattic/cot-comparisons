She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to contribute more around the house.\n\nFirst, the background: The wife quit her job to go back to school. They have two kids, one in kindergarten and another 1.5 years old not in daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression, is in counseling, and doesn't take meds. The author is handling almost all the household chores, cooking, dishes, laundry, waking up early for the kids, etc. He's also in online classes and struggling with sleep and wanting to take care of himself but can't because of the workload.\n\nSo, the main issue is the division of household responsibilities. The author feels the wife isn't doing her share, which is causing him stress and health concerns. The wife is at home all day, so he's asking if he's the asshole for wanting help.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, even though the wife has depression, the fact that she's at home all day might mean she should be contributing more. However, her mental health is a significant factor. If she's in a funk or unmotivated due to depression, that might explain her lack of help. The author is trying to manage work, school, and everything else without support, which is a lot.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether it's reasonable to expect the wife to help more given her circumstances. If her depression is severe enough that she can't contribute, then the author might not be in the wrong for wanting help. However, the wife might have a responsibility to manage her mental health in a way that allows her to fulfill household duties. \n\nThe author has communicated his feelings and even mentioned the risk of health issues, which shows he's trying to address the problem. The wife might need to be more proactive in managing her depression or finding ways to contribute, even if it's small steps. On the other hand, if her mental health is a barrier, the author might need to find other support, like hiring help or adjusting expectations.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is at home but not helping due to her mental health, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting help. However, it's a complex situation where both parties might need to adjust. The key is whether the author's expectations are unreasonable given her condition. Since he's taking on all the work and it's affecting his health, it's reasonable for him to want support. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
