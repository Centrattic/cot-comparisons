She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife who isn't contributing much to household chores, and the husband is overwhelmed with work, caring for two kids, and managing the household. He's also dealing with his own health and career goals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles and expectations in their relationship. The wife quit her job to go back to school, and they can't afford daycare because it's too expensive. She has depression and is in counseling. The husband is handling all the domestic tasks, cooking, cleaning, childcare, etc., which is taking a toll on him. He's getting very little sleep and not taking care of his own health.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and communication. The husband is asking for help around the house because he feels overburdened. The wife isn't contributing as much as he'd like, even after being asked. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting more help.\n\nOn one hand, the wife is dealing with depression and might have limitations on her ability to contribute. Mental health issues can affect someone's capacity to perform daily tasks. The husband acknowledges her struggles and tries to support her by giving her breaks. However, despite that, he's still shouldering the majority of the responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is taking on an immense workload. He's working, attending classes, caring for two children, and managing the household. His health is suffering, and he's worried about his long-term well-being. It's reasonable for him to want more help, especially since his wife is at home. The fact that she's not contributing could be due to her mental health, but the husband is also responsible for ensuring their partnership is balanced.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband mentions he's told his wife he's stressed and might die young from the strain. It's possible that their communication isn't effective. Maybe he hasn't set clear expectations or boundaries, or maybe she's not aware of the extent of his burden. The husband could be making assumptions about her capabilities without considering her mental health impact. However, he's also not the one who's supposed to handle everything alone.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while traditional gender roles might expect the wife to handle more domestic duties, modern relationships often emphasize shared responsibilities. The wife being a stay-at-home parent might be expected to contribute more, but her mental health issues complicate that.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's not communicating his needs effectively or being understanding of her limitations, maybe. But given the description, he seems to be trying to support her while also needing her to contribute. The fact that he's taking on so much without help, and his health is suffering, suggests that he's not in the wrong for wanting more help. He's justified in feeling overwhelmed and needing support from his spouse, especially since she's at home and could potentially contribute more if able. However, the wife's mental health is a significant factor that shouldn't be ignored. The problem might be more about how they're handling the situation together rather than one being wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting help around the house. The situation requires better communication and possibly adjusting expectations considering the wife's mental health. The answer should be B (No).\n"
