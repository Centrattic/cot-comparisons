She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife who isn't contributing to household chores, and the author is feeling overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife quit her job to focus on school and dealing with depression. They have two kids, one in kindergarten and a 1.5-year-old not in daycare because it's too expensive. The wife is in counseling but refuses medication. She has depressive episodes where she doesn't do much. The husband is handling all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare, even waking up early to manage everything. He's also taking online classes to better his career and trying to work out but can't because he's too tired. He's getting around 4-5 hours of sleep due to the toddler waking up. He's stressed and feels like he might die young from the pressure.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting more help. The wife is at home all day, so he's arguing she should contribute more. But she's dealing with depression and depression can affect motivation and ability to contribute. The husband is doing everything else, which is a lot. \n\nI should consider if he's unreasonable in expecting help. On one hand, he's doing all the work, and she's not pulling her weight. On the other hand, her mental health is a factor. The husband has tried to give her breaks and support her, but she's not following through. \n\nIs the problem that he's not being understanding? Or is it that she's not taking responsibility despite being able to? The wife's depression is a legitimate issue, but the husband is also taking on more than he can handle. The user is asking if he's the asshole. \n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong because he's trying to manage a lot and is asking for help. However, there's a need for better communication and possibly professional help. But from a moral standpoint, he's not the one being unreasonable. The wife's depression might be a barrier, but the husband is doing everything he can and is reaching out for support. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
