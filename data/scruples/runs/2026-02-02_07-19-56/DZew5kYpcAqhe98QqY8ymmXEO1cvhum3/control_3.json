She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is that the author's wife is a stay-at-home mom, she quit her job to go back to school, and she's dealing with depression. The author feels overwhelmed with all the household chores and childcare, doing almost everything by themselves. They mention that their wife doesn't take medication, is in counseling, and sometimes doesn't do the small tasks they ask her to do. The author is stressed, not getting enough sleep, and wants help around the house.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is being unreasonable. The wife is at home with two kids, one in kindergarten and the other 1.5 years old. The author is taking online classes and working, so their schedule is also busy. The main issue is the division of household labor and the wife's contribution. The author is doing most of the work, and the wife isn't helping as much as they'd like. But the wife has depression, which the author acknowledges. \n\nDepression can affect a person's motivation and ability to perform daily tasks. The wife is in counseling, so maybe she's working on it, but the author might not be considering the impact of her mental health on her ability to help. The author is asking for help, which is reasonable in a partnership, especially with two young children. However, the wife might be overwhelmed with caring for the baby and herself while also going back to school. \n\nThe author's complaint is about the wife not doing her share. But the wife is a stay-at-home mom, so she's already managing childcare. The cost of daycare is a factor here. The author mentions that they text her during the day to remind her of tasks, but she doesn't do them. There might be a communication issue. The author is taking care of the kids and the house, which is a lot, but the wife might be dealing with her own challenges. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expecting help? It's about shared responsibilities in a marriage. If the wife is at home all day, it's reasonable to expect assistance, but if her mental health is making it difficult, maybe the author isn't considering that enough. The author also mentions not wanting \"me time\" but still needing to take care of themselves. The wife's lack of action is leading to the author's stress and health concerns. \n\nThe key points are mutual support, understanding the wife's mental health, and communication. The author might be overburdened, but the wife's depression could be a legitimate reason for her not contributing as much. The author needs to address this with empathy, perhaps seek a middle ground, and maybe involve the wife in decision-making regarding their family situation. \n\nThe author's statement that they feel like they might die young because of stress and lack of self-care is a red flag. It's important to maintain one's health. However, the author should also consider whether the wife's depression is a contributing factor and if they're approaching the situation with the right support. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on how they're handling it. They have a right to ask for help, but they might not be approaching it in a supportive way given the wife's mental health. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're seeking balance and have legitimate concerns. But maybe A (Yes) if they're not being understanding of the wife's condition. However, the wife's depression is a factor, and the author is trying to manage both work and family. The question is whether the author is unreasonable for wanting help. Given that the wife is at home with two kids and dealing with depression, the author is not the asshole for wanting assistance, but the approach and communication are crucial. The answer would likely be B.\n"
