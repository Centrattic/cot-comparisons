She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know whether the author (who's a husband) is in the wrong for expecting his stay-at-home wife to help more with household chores. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple moved recently because of the husband's job. The wife left her job to pursue school and also because they can't afford daycare for their 1.5-year-old, especially since it's more expensive than what she'd earn. She has depression and isn't on medication, which affects her mood and ability to contribute. The husband is doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare, even waking up early to handle things before work. He's also managing his online classes and wants to work out but doesn't have the energy. He's feeling overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole for wanting help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife is at home all day but not contributing, she has mental health issues, and the husband is handling everything with little support. The question is if the husband is in the wrong for expecting her to help more.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the wife is dealing with depression, which can make it hard to take on household tasks. She's in counseling, but maybe that's not enough. The husband is taking on a lot, which is causing him stress and health issues. On the other hand, the husband is asking for help, which is reasonable. The wife's lack of contribution is a problem, especially when she's home all day. \n\nBut does that mean the husband is in the wrong? It depends on communication. Have they discussed the issue? The husband mentions he has told her his feelings, but maybe there's a communication breakdown. The wife might be struggling with her mental health to the point where even small tasks are difficult. The husband might not be considering how her depression affects her ability to contribute, or maybe he's not being supportive in a way that addresses her needs first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is overburdened and it's unfair of the wife to not help. But given her mental health, it's not entirely in her control. The husband needs to consider that. However, expecting some level of contribution, even if small, is reasonable. The key is balance and understanding. If the wife is physically and mentally unable to help, then the husband might need to seek other solutions, like professional help or adjusting expectations. \n\nThe husband's stress and health are valid concerns. If he's not taking care of himself because he's overworked, that's a problem for both of them. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting support. I think it's more about the wife's situation and how they handle it together. The husband is not in the wrong for needing help; he's just overwhelmed. But maybe he's not approaching it with enough empathy or addressing her mental health needs first. However, the core issue is the wife's lack of contribution, which is affecting the household's balance. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's overburdened and has legitimate needs. The wife's mental health is a factor, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting assistance.\n"
