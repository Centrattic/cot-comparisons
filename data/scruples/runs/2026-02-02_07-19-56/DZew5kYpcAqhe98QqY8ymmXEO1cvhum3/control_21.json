She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a stay-at-home wife and the husband feeling overburdened with household responsibilities and childcare. The wife has depression and doesn't want medication, and the husband is handling almost everything, which is making him stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife left her job to go back to school, but the cost of childcare is too high. She's dealing with depression and counseling. The husband is doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, waking up early for work, taking care of the kids, and even doing the wife's chores. He's also managing his job and online classes, with very little sleep. He feels he can't keep this up and is worried about his health.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's clearly overworked. The wife is at home all day but isn't contributing, despite the husband's efforts to remind her. Her depression might affect her ability to help, but that doesn't mean she can't do basic tasks. The husband is asking for help, which is reasonable. The wife's excuses are making things harder for him. \n\nBut wait, the wife has mental health challenges. Should that be considered? Maybe she's struggling more than she shows, but the husband has tried to support her with breaks. The main issue is the lack of contribution from the wife. Even with depression, some level of shared responsibility is normal. The husband is asking for help, not perfection. \n\nAlso, the husband's health is a concern. If he's not taking care of himself, that's a problem. The wife might need to step up, even if it's small things. The husband isn't being unreasonable; he's just asking for support. The wife's actions (leaving clothes for a week, not doing tasks) show a lack of effort. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the husband isn't in the wrong). He's justified in wanting help. The wife's mental health is a factor, but she's not fulfilling her role in the household, which is causing strain. The husband is doing more than his fair share and is taking care of both work and family, which isn't sustainable. The key here is that the wife isn't contributing, and the husband is asking for assistance, which is reasonable. Therefore, the husband isn't the asshole.\n"
