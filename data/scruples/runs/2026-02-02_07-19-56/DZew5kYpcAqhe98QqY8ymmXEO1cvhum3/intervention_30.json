She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a working parent who's handling most of the household responsibilities, and their stay-at-home wife isn't contributing much. The wife has depression and the author is stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife quit her job to go back to school and take care of the kids, but she's not helping with chores. The author is managing work, online classes, and all the household tasks, leading to stress and lack of personal time. The wife is in counseling but refuses medication and has mood issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting more help. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: They're overburdened, working, taking classes, and doing all the housework. They feel their health is at risk. It's reasonable for them to feel overwhelmed and want support.\n\nThe wife's perspective: She has depression, which affects her ability to contribute. She's managing two young kids and the emotional stress of her condition. Her excuses like \"later\" or not doing tasks might be due to her mental health struggles.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? They're not being abusive or unreasonable in wanting help. They're asking for support in a fair division of labor. However, the author might not be acknowledging the wife's mental health issues enough. Maybe they need to communicate better or seek couples counseling instead of just blaming her.\n\nThe key points are mutual support and understanding. The author's stress is valid, but the wife's mental health is a factor. The author's approach of doing everything themselves might be unsustainable, but they shouldn't be blamed for wanting help. It's more about how they handle the situation. Since the wife isn't contributing and the author is trying to manage everything, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a need for more empathy towards the wife's situation. However, the author's request for help isn't unreasonable. So I think the answer is B (author not in the wrong), as the situation is complex but the author's needs are valid.\n"
