She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their stay-at-home wife to contribute more around the house. The author's wife quit her job to go back to school and has depression, which is being managed through counseling but without medication. She's home with two kids, one in kindergarten and another 1.5 years old. The husband is handling most of the domestic chores and childcare, working, taking online classes, and feeling overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, the wife's mental health is a significant factor. Depression can affect a person's ability to manage daily tasks and contribute to household responsibilities. The author acknowledges her depression and tries to support her by giving her breaks. However, the wife isn't pulling her weight, which is causing the author immense stress.\n\nThe husband is juggling work, school, and all the household duties. He's getting only 4-5 hours of sleep a night due to the toddler's needs. He's not getting time for himself, which is leading to feelings of burnout and health concerns. The key issue here is the imbalance in the division of labor and emotional labor in the household.\n\nThe wife's refusal to take on more responsibilities despite being home all day is a point of contention. The husband feels it's unfair when he's doing everything. However, the wife's mental health issues might be a legitimate barrier. But the husband has tried to communicate his needs and hasn't been met with cooperation. The fact that the wife's tasks are left undone even when reminded multiple times suggests a lack of engagement.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't asking for a perfect division but some contribution. The wife's role as a SAHP should allow her to handle more of the household duties, but her mental health is a complicating factor. However, relying solely on the husband's efforts isn't sustainable. There's a need for mutual support and realistic expectations.\n\nThe husband's health and well-being are also at stake. Chronic stress and lack of self-care can lead to serious health issues. The situation seems unsustainable if the wife isn't contributing significantly. The husband hasn't been met with understanding or compromise from his wife, which is causing resentment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's mental health is a valid challenge, the husband's request for help isn't unreasonable. The wife's lack of contribution, despite being home full-time, is the root of the problem. The husband is justified in seeking a more balanced partnership. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
