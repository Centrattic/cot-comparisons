She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he and his wife moved for his job, and she quit her job to go back to school. They have two kids, a 5-year-old in kindergarten and a 1.5-year-old not in daycare. The main issue is that the wife isn't contributing much to household chores, and he's doing almost everything\u2014cooking, cleaning, laundry, taking care of the kids. He's also working and taking online classes, which is adding to his stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife has depression and is in counseling, but doesn't want medication. She's at home, so maybe her mental health affects her ability to manage chores. The husband mentions she gets in \"freaks\" where she's unhappy and things aren't right. He's trying to support her by giving her breaks from the 1-year-old and letting her do things to boost her mood. But despite that, she doesn't do any chores at home. He texts her reminders, but they don't get done. When he asks her to do something small, she postpones it, and eventually he has to do it. There's an example where he folded the baby's clothes, asked her to put them away, but a week later they were still in the basket.\n\nHe's working, taking classes, and not getting enough sleep. He's concerned about his health because he's not working out and is stressed. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting help around the house since she's at home all day. The key question is whether the husband is in the wrong by expecting her to contribute more, given her mental health issues and the circumstances.\n\nI should think about what's fair in a marriage where one partner is at home. If the wife is not working and the kids are at home, maybe she's expected to handle more domestic tasks. But she has depression, which might make it harder for her to manage those tasks. The husband is doing everything, which is a lot, especially with a young child. However, he hasn't mentioned discussing this with her or setting boundaries. He says he's told her he might die young from stress, but has he tried to communicate his needs in a constructive way? \n\nDepression can affect motivation and ability to perform daily tasks. If she's in therapy, maybe that's part of her treatment. The husband might be feeling overburdened, but without a clear communication of expectations and understanding of her limitations, it's hard to say. The husband's approach of texting reminders and then doing the tasks himself might not be effective. He could be trying to take on too much without considering her mental state. \n\nBut he is also working and studying, which is a lot. It's a balance. The wife might need more support, but the husband has a right to expect some help. The problem is whether he's being reasonable in his expectations given her mental health. If he hasn't had an open conversation about how to share responsibilities considering her condition, maybe he's not in the wrong, but the situation could be handled better. \n\nAlso, the fact that the husband is doing everything might lead to resentment. The wife might not realize the extent of the burden or might feel unable to cope. So, the husband's frustration is understandable, but the way he's handling it could use improvement. The answer would likely be that the husband is not in the wrong (B), but he might need to approach the situation with more empathy and collaboration, perhaps discussing with his wife how to divvy up chores in a way that accommodates her mental health.\n"
