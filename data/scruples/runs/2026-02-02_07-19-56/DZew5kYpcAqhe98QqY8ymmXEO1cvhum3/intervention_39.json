She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a working parent with a stay-at-home wife who's also dealing with depression. They have two kids, which is a lot. The wife quit her job before moving to go back to school, but now they can't afford daycare because it's too expensive. The author is handling all the household chores, cooking, cleaning, laundry, taking care of the kids, and even managing his own online classes and workouts. He's getting about 4-5 hours of sleep a night because of the 1-year-old waking up.\n\nThe wife is in counseling for depression and refuses medication. She has mood swings where she's unhappy, but the author is trying to give her breaks. However, she doesn't contribute much around the house. The author feels overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole for wanting help. He's even worried about his health because he's stressed and not taking care of himself.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. First, the wife is a stay-at-home mom with depression. That's a significant mental health issue that can affect her ability to manage daily tasks. The author is doing everything else, but he's also under a lot of stress. The key here is whether the author is being reasonable in his expectations. \n\nDepression can significantly impact someone's motivation and energy levels. The wife might be trying, but her condition is making it hard. The author is doing a lot, but he's clearly exhausted. The question is if he's being unfair by expecting her to take on more, given her mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is managing work, school, and parenting. It's a heavy load, and he's right to feel overwhelmed. But he's asking if he's the asshole. Maybe he's not wrong to want support. However, the wife's mental health is a factor that he's acknowledging. It's a balance between his needs and her capacity. \n\nThe author might be right to seek help, but maybe he should approach it differently. Communication is key here. If he's been asking her to do things and she's not responding, perhaps there's a need for a more open discussion about how to share responsibilities, considering her mental health. But is he in the wrong? If he's doing everything himself and she's not contributing, maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting help. However, if the wife's depression is a major barrier, then maybe the author needs to find other solutions rather than just expecting her to do more. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being unreasonable given the wife's circumstances. The wife is at home but dealing with depression. The author is doing all the work. It's a tough situation. But since the author is clearly struggling and the wife isn't contributing, he's not in the wrong for wanting help. However, he might need to approach it with more empathy and find ways to support her while also addressing his own needs. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
