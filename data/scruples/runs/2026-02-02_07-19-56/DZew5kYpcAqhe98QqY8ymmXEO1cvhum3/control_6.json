She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a working parent with two kids, and their wife is a stay-at-home mom. The wife quit her job to go back to school, but they can't afford daycare, so she's home with the kids. She has depression and isn't taking meds, but the author feels like she's not contributing to the household. The author is doing almost everything: cooking, cleaning, managing the kids, even doing laundry and dishes. The wife is supposed to help but doesn't, and when asked, she procrastinates or doesn't do things. The author is stressed, getting little sleep, and wants more help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is wrong for feeling this way. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). The key points here are the division of labor, the wife's mental health, and the author's workload.\n\nThe wife is dealing with depression, which is a significant factor. Depression can impair a person's ability to function normally, including managing household tasks. The author mentions that she's in counseling but refuses medication. So her lack of contribution might be partly due to her mental health issues. However, the author is also handling a lot, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nThe author is doing all the chores, taking care of the kids, working, and studying. They're getting only 4-5 hours of sleep. That's a lot of stress and responsibility. It's reasonable for them to feel overwhelmed and to want help. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for expecting their wife to help more.\n\nThe wife is at home all day, so she has the opportunity to contribute. However, her mental health is a barrier. The author has tried to communicate their needs, like texting reminders and asking for help. But the wife isn't responding. The author's frustration is valid because they're stretched thin. But is it wrong to want more help from a spouse who's dealing with depression?\n\nIt's important to consider that the wife might not be able to contribute as much as the author expects due to her depression. The author might need to approach this with more empathy, possibly working with the wife to set realistic expectations or seeking couples counseling. However, the author isn't wrong for feeling overwhelmed. They're not at fault for wanting the situation to be different. The issue might be more about communication and support rather than the author being in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should share household responsibilities. The fact that the wife is home and the author is working and studying might mean the responsibilities should be split. But given the wife's mental health, it's a complex situation. The author is doing the right thing by trying to manage everything but might need to address the communication gap with their wife. However, expecting the author to carry all the load without any help is unreasonable. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting help; they're in a tough spot and need support.\n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong. They're overburdened and have valid concerns. The problem lies more in the wife's inability to contribute due to her mental health, not the author's expectations.\n"
