She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who's handling most of the household responsibilities and childcare, with his wife staying home because she left her job to go back to school. She has depression and isn't taking medication, and she's not contributing much to the household.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship. The wife chose to stay home, and initially, maybe they had a different arrangement. But now, the husband is feeling overwhelmed and is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for wanting more help. The key points here are the wife's mental health, their children's needs, and the division of labor.\n\nThe wife is dealing with depression, which the husband acknowledges. He's supportive, giving her breaks and trying to help her mood. However, she's not taking on household tasks, which is causing the husband to take on everything. He's working, taking classes, and managing the kids, leading to stress and lack of self-care.\n\nNow, is the husband wrong? Well, expecting some help in a shared household is reasonable. If the wife is at home all day, even if she's dealing with depression, there's a balance. The husband mentions she doesn't want to take meds, but she's in counseling. Maybe there's a communication issue. Did he talk to her about his needs? The post says he's told her he's stressed, but maybe not in a way that leads to actionable solutions. Or maybe she's unable to help due to her mental health. \n\nBut from the husband's perspective, he's doing everything, which is unsustainable. Even with her depression, basic tasks should be possible. The fact that she leaves things undone and the husband has to do everything might mean she's not meeting her responsibilities, which is a common issue in relationships. However, the husband's approach of texting reminders and doing everything himself might not be effective. Perhaps he needs to set boundaries or seek therapy together to address this.\n\nThe wife might not be in the wrong either if her depression is severely impacting her ability to contribute. Mental health can be a significant barrier. But if there's a lack of effort despite being capable, the husband's frustration is valid. The answer hinges on whether the wife's depression is preventing her from contributing, or if she's choosing not to. The husband is not wrong for feeling that he needs help, especially since he's doing everything and it's affecting his health. However, the situation might require more communication or professional help rather than just pointing fingers. The husband's actions (taking on all responsibilities) might not be the issue, but expecting his wife to contribute more is reasonable. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's justified in wanting help, even though the situation is complex.\n"
