She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: They moved because of his job. The wife left her job before moving because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, a 1-year-old not in daycare and a 5-year-old in kindergarten. The wife has depression and is in counseling but doesn't take meds. She gets into moods where she's unhappy. The husband is handling all the cooking, dishes, laundry, getting up early for work, managing the kids in the morning, and even doing the chores when she doesn't. He's also taking online classes and trying to work out but only gets 4-5 hours of sleep. He's stressed and feels like he might die young from the stress.\n\nSo, the main points here are about the division of labor and the wife's mental health. The husband feels overwhelmed and wants her to contribute more, while the wife isn't doing much. He's doing everything else, even with his own responsibilities. The wife's depression might be a factor in her lack of participation.\n\nI need to consider if the husband is in the wrong. In many cases, when a spouse is dealing with mental health issues, the partner might take on more household duties. However, expecting some level of contribution is reasonable. The wife is at home all day, so some tasks might be manageable even with her depression. But depression can severely impact a person's ability to function, so maybe the husband isn't considering that enough. However, he's also doing a lot and feeling burnt out.\n\nThe key question is whether the husband is being unreasonable. If the wife's depression is preventing her from contributing, and he's not providing enough support or there's a lack of communication, maybe he's part of the problem. On the other hand, if he's taking on all the responsibilities without any help and it's leading to his own health issues, he's justified in wanting support.\n\nAnother angle: The wife might need more help managing her depression, possibly including medication, but she refuses. The husband is trying to give her breaks but she still isn't doing anything. The examples given (like not doing laundry, leaving clothes for a week) suggest a lack of action on her part. The husband's health is at risk, and he's trying to maintain both his career and their family.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not acknowledging her mental health struggles and is expecting too much, maybe. But if he's reasonable in his expectations and she's not meeting them despite his support, then she might be the one not pulling her weight. The husband's communication seems direct (texting her, talking to her), but maybe he's not approaching it in a way that's considerate of her mental state. Perhaps he's not offering help in a way that makes it easier for her to contribute, given her depression.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's mental health is a significant factor, the husband's situation is also valid. The answer might depend on whether he's being reasonable in his expectations. Since he's doing everything else and she's not contributing despite being at home, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the situation could be improved with better communication or professional help. Considering all that, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong) because he's justified in wanting help, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
