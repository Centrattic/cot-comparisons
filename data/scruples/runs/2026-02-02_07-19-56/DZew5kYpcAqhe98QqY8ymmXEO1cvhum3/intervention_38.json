She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his stay-at-home wife to do more around the house. The background details are pretty extensive.\n\nFirst, the wife is dealing with depression and has chosen not to take medication. She's in counseling, which is good, but her mental health might be affecting her ability to contribute. The author mentions that she doesn't do much around the house, and he's handling all the chores, kids, and even his own work and studies. He's clearly overwhelmed and feels like he can't keep up the pace.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: the wife's mental health is a significant factor. Depression can severely impact a person's motivation and energy levels. Even if she's not taking meds, counseling is a step, but it might not be enough. The author is asking for help, but the wife is not responding as he'd like. He's feeling resentful and stressed, which is understandable given his workload.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, having a stay-at-home parent doesn't automatically mean they should do all the housework. Both partners should contribute as per their abilities. However, the wife's mental health complicates things. The author might not be approaching the situation with enough empathy. He's listing the tasks he does, but maybe he's not effectively communicating his needs or helping her manage her depression. It's possible that he's not offering enough support or understanding, which could be making the situation worse.\n\nOn the other hand, expecting some level of contribution from both partners is reasonable. If she's not contributing due to depression, maybe they need a different approach, like professional help or restructuring tasks. But the author's tone seems more like frustration rather than seeking a solution together. He might be overlooking the impact of her mental health and not approaching the problem collaboratively.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting help, but his approach could be part of the problem. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer could hinge on how the situation is handled. If he's not supporting her mental health adequately, that's an issue. But if he's genuinely overwhelmed and seeking balance, maybe not. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the core issue is about shared responsibilities and stress, though his method of handling it could use improvement.\n"
