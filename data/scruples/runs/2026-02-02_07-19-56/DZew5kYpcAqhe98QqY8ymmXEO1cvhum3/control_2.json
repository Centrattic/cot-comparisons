She quit her job before we left because she didn't really enjoy it &amp; she wanted to go back to school. We have 2 kids, 1 in Kindergarten &amp; the other 1.5 years old that is not in daycare, mainly due to daycare being more expensive then we would like, to the point it would take the majority of the money she would make if she went to work here.\n\nShe has had, &amp; still has, issues with depression. She is in counseling, she doesn't want to take meds at all though. She gets in funks sometimes where nothing is right &amp; she is just unhappy with everything. I understand all of that &amp; do what I can to give her breaks from our 1 year old &amp; let her do things that will boost her mood. That being said she doesn't do shit at home. I cook all the food, I do all the dishes &amp; laundry, I go to bed later than she does &amp; wake up about 1.5-2 hours before her to get ready for work, wake up my daughter to have breakfast &amp; get ready for school, get my 1 year old up to get him changed, feed him, &amp; have him ready to go in the morning so that she just has to get up have my daughter brush her teeth &amp; get in the car to take them to school. I will text her to remind her to do stuff during the day &amp; when I get home they aren't done. If we are at home together &amp; I ask her to do something small like sort the clothes so i can get them washed. Her excuse is always \"ok, i will do it in a little bit.\" That turns into a whole day &amp; when I get up Saturday morning &amp; it isn't done I sort the clothes &amp; get them started in the wash because we all need clean clothes for the next week. I recall one time not too long ago, i washed &amp; folded our 1 year olds clothes &amp; had them in a basket in the living room. I asked my wife if she could put them away. Literally a week later (Sunday to Sunday) the basket of clothes was still sitting in the living room righ beside her spot on the couch.\n\nMy job isn't too straining, but I am taking online classes so that I can better my career, I need to be working out but it seems like my energy is zapped because I get \\~4-5 hours of sleep a night, interrupted by my 1 year old waking up &amp; I take care of him when that happens. I am energetic when I get off of work &amp; walk home but then i have to pick up around the house, cook dinner, get my daughter taken care of as far as a shower &amp; ready for the next day of school, feed my son &amp; get him bathed as well, &amp; I want to work out but I just want to sit down &amp;/or play with the kids after my day is done when I should go for a run or do something. I don't really care about \"me time\" honestly, but I really feel like I am geting out of shape &amp; I want to get better.\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting help around the house since she is at home all day &amp; I can't keep this up forever. I have literally told her I feel like I might die young at 40 because I am stressed about a lot of shit &amp; not taking care of myself because I don't have time.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who moved for his job. His wife quit her job because she didn't enjoy it and wanted to go back to school. They have two kids, and they can't afford daycare because it's too expensive. The wife has depression and is in counseling but doesn't take medication. She's supposed to be at home, but the author is handling all the chores, cooking, dishes, laundry, and taking care of the kids. He feels overworked and stressed, getting only 4-5 hours of sleep. He's also in online classes and wants to work out but doesn't have time. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting his wife to help more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is a stay-at-home mom, but she has mental health issues. The husband is working, in school, and doing all the household tasks. The wife might be overwhelmed with depression, which affects her ability to contribute. The author feels like he can't keep up and is worried about his health.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's mental health, the division of labor, and the husband's stress. The author is clearly doing the majority of the work, which is leading to burnout. However, the wife's depression is a significant factor. People with depression can struggle with motivation and daily tasks, even if they are physically capable. The husband has tried to support her by giving her breaks and doing things to boost her mood, but she's still not helping.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his need for help and feeling overwhelmed. He's not being unreasonable in wanting support. The wife's depression is a medical condition that affects her ability to function, but that doesn't mean the husband isn't entitled to help. The issue here is communication and finding a way to balance their responsibilities. The husband might not be in the wrong because he's trying to manage his stress and workload, but he needs to address this with empathy and find solutions that consider both their needs.\n\nOn the other hand, if the husband hasn't communicated his expectations clearly or if he's being overly demanding without understanding her situation, that could be an issue. However, from the description, he seems to be doing the opposite\u2014trying to help her with mental health and asking for small tasks. The problem is that she's not responding, which is more on her mental health rather than the husband's actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband isn't the asshole. He's in a tough spot and needs help, but he's also trying to support his wife. The answer should be B (No).\n"
