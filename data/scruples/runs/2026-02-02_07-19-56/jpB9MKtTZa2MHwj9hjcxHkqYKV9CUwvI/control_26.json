She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was seeing a girl for two months and decided not to date her because she had slept with many guys on his college football team. The main reasons he gives are his boundary about not dating someone who's slept with his friends and not wanting to be in a relationship with someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is being honest about his boundaries, which is important in relationships. If someone's values or boundaries are important to them, it's reasonable to not proceed if those boundaries aren't met. However, the issue might be whether his reasons are discriminatory or unfair. \n\nHe mentions not wanting to date someone who sleeps with friends, which is a personal boundary. That could be seen as a personal choice rather than a judgment. However, the second point about \"ball bunnies\" might touch on stereotypes about women's behavior. If he's basing his decision on her sexual history without her current intentions or if he's making assumptions about her character based on that, that could be problematic. \n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist, which is a strong accusation. The author argues that if the roles were reversed, he'd make the same choice. But that's a hypothetical. Also, the fact that he was honest, even if it hurt her feelings, might be seen as better than being insincere. However, the way he communicated his reasons might have been harsh, even if the reasons themselves are personal. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's autonomy and choices. While it's his right to have boundaries, the question is whether judging someone's sexual history is a fair reason to reject a relationship. Some might argue that as long as she's being truthful and not pressuring him, her past shouldn't matter. Others might say that personal boundaries are valid and shouldn't be criticized. \n\nThe author's reasoning about avoiding drama and potential insecurity is a personal choice. However, the fact that the girl was open about her past might mean she wasn't trying to hide anything, so his rejection based on that could be seen as holding her to a standard that others (like male athletes) might not face. If the team's culture is such that this is common, maybe the author is being overly judgmental. \n\nAlso, the mutual friend's reaction could be based on the idea that the author is making a value judgment about the girl's worth based on her sexual history, which is a form of sexism. The author's claim that he'd do the same if the gender roles were reversed might not hold if he's making assumptions about her behavior versus a male's. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether his reasons are based on personal boundaries vs. discriminatory attitudes. If it's the former, he's not wrong. If it's the latter, then he is. The line between the two can be thin. The fact that he was upfront and didn't lie about it shows respect, but the underlying reasons might still be problematic.\n"
