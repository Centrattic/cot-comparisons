She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is they were seeing a girl for two months and then decided not to date her because she had slept with a bunch of guys on their college football team. The guy gives two reasons: one, he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends (the team), and two, he doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes because he might go pro.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The girl was honest with him, right? When he said no, she asked if it was because of the team guys, and he confirmed. So he was upfront about his reasons. But is it fair to base a relationship on whether someone has slept with your friends? That seems a bit judgmental. People have different standards, but is it wrong to have those standards?\n\nThen there's the part about not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes. The guy mentions he's realistic about his pro chances, so he's worried about being in a relationship that might not last. But is that a valid reason? It's his decision, but maybe it's a personal preference rather than a right or wrong thing.\n\nThe mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The guy argues that if he were a girl and this girl was a guy, his answer would be the same. So he's claiming it's not about gender but about the situation. But is there an implicit sexism here? Maybe the issue is that he's judging the girl based on her sexual history, which could be seen as double standards if he wouldn't judge a guy the same way. But he says he would have the same stance if roles were reversed, which complicates that angle.\n\nAlso, considering the girl's perspective, she might feel hurt because he's rejecting her for something that's part of her past. If she's open about her past, is it fair for him to turn her down? It's her life, but he's supposed to accept her as she is if he's into her. But he's also setting boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. He was honest and didn't hide his feelings, which is fair. But using someone's sexual history as a deal-breaker could be seen as judgmental. However, people do have different values and boundaries. So even though it might be judgmental, it's not necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense because he's making a personal choice based on his own standards.\n\nAnother angle: the guy didn't pressure her into anything. He was clear about his reasons, and they parted ways amicably. The mutual friend's anger might be more about not wanting to see the girl get hurt, but the guy isn't obligated to explain his decisions to others. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's his right to set personal boundaries, even if others disapprove. However, there's a societal expectation to not judge others for their past, which complicates things. But ultimately, personal choice in relationships is subjective, and unless he was being discriminatory in an illegal or unethical way, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
