She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he was casually dating a girl for two months and then decided not to take it further because she had slept with 12 guys on his football team. He gave two reasons: not wanting to date someone with partners he's friends with (like the \"don't shit where you eat\" thing) and not wanting a relationship with someone who targets athletes, fearing it might be a \"ball bunny\" situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his reasoning is valid. The first point about boundaries is something personal. He has a boundary not to date someone who's slept with his friends. That's his choice, but does that make it wrong? Maybe not, but some might argue that it's unfair to judge someone's past. The second reason is about her targeting athletes. If she's been with a lot of athletes, maybe he feels it's a red flag for commitment or genuine interest. But is it fair for him to judge based on her past relationships? Also, his mutual friend called him sexist, which adds another layer. He says he'd feel the same if the roles were reversed, but does that hold up? If he was into guys and they were friends with the same people, would his reaction be the same? That's a good point. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. He mentions the potential for being roasted by teammates. That's a valid concern for him, but maybe he's prioritizing his social comfort over her feelings. The girl was hurt when he told her directly. Did he handle it poorly? Maybe he could have been more tactful, but his reasons are clear. The friend's anger suggests that others might see his actions as judgmental or sexist. \n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong here because it's about personal boundaries. But morally or socially, is he? He's not forcing her; he's choosing not to date her. However, some might argue that his reasons are based on stereotypes (ball bunnies) and could be seen as unfair. On the other hand, people have the right to set their own boundaries. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think it's a nuanced situation. He's being honest about his boundaries, but the way he communicated it might have been harsh. The friend's reaction points out that his reasoning could be sexist, especially if he's applying different standards. But if he's consistent in his boundaries regardless of gender, maybe that's not the case. Overall, I think it's a personal choice, and while the friend is upset, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting his own limits. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
