She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history.\n\nFirst, the author is a college football player who was casually dating a girl. They've been together for two months, and she's nice and attractive. The key issue is that she's slept with 12 guys on his team. When she asked to become official, he declined. His two main reasons are: 1) he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\"), and 2) he doesn't want to date someone who \"goes after athletes\" because he might go pro and doesn't want a \"ball bunny.\" \n\nHe didn't want to explain the reasons at first but ended up confirming it was because of the team members. The girl was hurt, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The author is confused and thinks he's being fair, especially if the roles were reversed, and he's also concerned about potential teasing and insecurity.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's setting personal boundaries. He's clear that his decision is based on his own comfort and values. He doesn't want drama with teammates and has a legitimate career path in mind. He doesn't see it as sexist because he's applying the same standard to himself if the roles were reversed. Also, he's being honest about his reasons after the fact, even though he was conflicted about how to explain it initially.\n\nOn the other side, the girl's sexual history is her personal choice. Judging someone for their past relationships or sexual partners can be seen as hypocritical or discriminatory. The friend's reaction as a \"sexist asshole\" might stem from the belief that it's unfair to judge a woman's worth based on her sexual history. The author's second reason about \"ball bunnies\" could be a stereotype, which might contribute to that perception.\n\nHowever, the author isn't making her do anything; he's just choosing not to pursue a relationship. Personal boundaries are subjective, and while some might criticize his reasoning, others might respect his decision. The key here is whether his reasoning is valid in the context of personal choice versus societal judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might argue the author is being judgmental or sexist, others might see it as his right to set personal boundaries. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given the context of his stated reasons and the lack of coercion or harm beyond his own decision, it's more about personal values than wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
