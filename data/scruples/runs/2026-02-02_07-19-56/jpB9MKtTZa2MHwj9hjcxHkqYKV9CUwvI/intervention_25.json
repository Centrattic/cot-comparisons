She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history. The scenario is that the girl slept with multiple guys on his football team, and he decided not to date her because of that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments presented. The author lists two main reasons: 1) He doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends (he compares it to \"don't shit where you eat\"), and 2) He doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes, fearing it might affect his pro football career.\n\nFrom a personal boundaries perspective, everyone has the right to set their own limits in relationships. If the author is uncomfortable with the girl's history, that's his choice. However, the ethical angle here is whether it's fair to judge someone based on their past relationships. The girl isn't doing anything illegal or harmful; it's her personal life. \n\nThe mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. That's a strong accusation. But if the author had the same standards regardless of gender, does that make it okay? The author claims he would have the same stance if the roles were reversed. That might mitigate the sexism claim, but the key issue is whether his reasons are valid or if they're based on outdated or judgmental views.\n\nAnother point is the girl's perspective. She might feel that her past shouldn't matter in a relationship. The author is making a decision based on her history, which could be seen as holding her to a standard he wouldn't apply to himself. However, if that's his personal boundary, it's his choice to follow it.\n\nThe potential for drama and team dynamics is a practical concern. If the girl slept with teammates, dating her could lead to jealousy or tension, which the author wants to avoid. That's a valid concern, but it's also a personal choice to avoid such situations.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't hurting anyone by choosing not to date her. He's being honest about his boundaries. However, some might argue that it's unfair to judge someone's worth based on their sexual history, which is a personal matter. The question is whether the author's decision is wrong for being judgmental or if it's a legitimate personal choice.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether personal boundaries are acceptable reasons for not pursuing a relationship, regardless of others' opinions. Since the author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards, just making a personal decision, he might not be in the wrong. However, if the judgment is based on sexist or discriminatory views, then it could be wrong. The author claims he's applying the same standard to men, so maybe not. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but there's room for debate. The key factors are personal choice and the absence of harm.\n"
