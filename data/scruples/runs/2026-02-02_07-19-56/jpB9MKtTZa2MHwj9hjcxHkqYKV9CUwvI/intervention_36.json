She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author declined a relationship with a girl who had slept with several members of his college football team. His reasons are that he doesn't date people who have slept with his friends (like \"don't shit where you eat\") and that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had been casually seeing this girl for two months. She approached him about dating, and he turned her down. The key factors here are the boundaries he set. He mentions a personal boundary about not dating someone who's slept with his friends. That's a personal choice, but is it justified? It's important to note that her sexual history is her personal business and doesn't necessarily reflect on her character. The author is making a judgment based on that, which could be seen as hypocritical, especially if he's also having sexual relationships with others. \n\nThen there's the second reason: he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes. That's a bit of a stereotype, labeling her as a \"ball bunny,\" which implies she's only interested in athletes for their status or potential future success. This could be a double standard, as men are often not criticized for similar behavior. The mutual friend who called him a sexist asshole might be right in pointing out that his reasoning could be based on gender stereotypes.\n\nThe author argues that his reasoning is consistent if the roles were reversed, but that's not quite accurate. If the girl were a man and had slept with other women, the scenario changes because societal norms around male sexuality are different. Also, the author's concern about being \"roasted\" or dealing with chirps suggests more about his own insecurities than her actions.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. But morally and socially, it's more complex. The question is about whether his actions were justified. Choosing not to date someone based on their sexual history isn't inherently wrong, as people have different boundaries. However, the way he framed his reasons\u2014using stereotypes and potentially sexist language\u2014could be problematic. The mutual friend's reaction might be valid in pointing out the sexist undertones, especially if the author is applying different standards based on gender.\n\nIn summary, while the author has the right to set personal boundaries, the way he expressed them and the stereotypes he used might make him the asshole in the situation. His reasoning could be seen as judgmental and sexist, even if his intentions were to avoid drama or insecurity.\n"
