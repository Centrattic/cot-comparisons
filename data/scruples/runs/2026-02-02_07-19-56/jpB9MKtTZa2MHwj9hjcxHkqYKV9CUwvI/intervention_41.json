She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if someone is at fault for not dating a girl because of her sexual history, specifically that she's slept with 12 guys from his college football team. The author has two main reasons: he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends, and he doesn't date girls who target athletes.\n\nFirst, the author's first point is about boundaries. He compares it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" which is a common metaphor for avoiding mixing personal and social interactions. But is this a valid boundary? Well, people have different boundaries, and in relationships, it's common to have preferences. However, if he's not dating someone just because they've had relationships with his friends, that might be more about his personal comfort than something inherently wrong with the girl. But maybe in a team setting, where friendships are close and interactions are frequent, that could lead to drama. But is it his right to set that boundary?\n\nSecond, the author is concerned about dating someone who \"goes after athletes\" because he might turn pro. This seems more like a stereotype. The term \"ball bunny\" is a derogatory term often used pejoratively for women who are perceived as seeking attention from athletes. However, the girl's actions\u2014sleeping with 12 teammates\u2014might not be about targeting athletes for their status, but perhaps about her own sexuality or social behavior. The author is making a judgment based on her history, which might be a form of stigma or unfair generalization.\n\nThe girl was hurt when he admitted it was about her sexual history. Emotional impact is a factor here. Even if the author is honest about his boundaries, the way he delivered it might have been hurtful. Also, the mutual friend's reaction as a \"sexist asshole\" suggests that others might view his reasoning as discriminatory. The author argues that if he were a girl in this situation, his answer would be the same. But that might be a flawed comparison because gender roles and societal expectations differ. However, it's possible that his reasoning is based on personal preferences rather than bias.\n\nAnother angle: consent and personal life. The girl's sexual history is her own business. As long as she's not in a relationship where there's jealousy or explicit agreements, her past shouldn't affect someone else's decision unless it directly impacts the relationship. The author's issue is with the social dynamics (friends, team members), which is more about his own comfort than her actions being wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is making a decision based on personal boundaries and preferences. While he's not necessarily \"wrong\" in the sense of violating any laws or moral standards, some might argue that he's being judgmental and applying double standards based on gender. The mutual friend's anger suggests that the judgment is seen as sexist. However, the author's reasoning is about his own boundaries and potential discomfort. If he's honest and upfront, it's his right to choose not to date someone for those reasons. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If \"wrong\" implies being sexist or judgmental, then maybe A. If it's just about personal choice, then B.\n\nThe key is whether his reasoning is valid. Since he's allowed to have personal boundaries, but the way he frames it might come across as discriminatory. The line between personal choice and judgment can be blurry. In many cases, people are allowed to have standards, but if those standards are based on stereotypes (like \"ball bunnies\"), then it's more problematic. The author's reasoning could be seen as a form of sexism, hence A. But if it's just his personal preference, then B. The mutual friend's reaction is a clue that others see it as A. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his reasons are justified as personal boundaries or if they're discriminatory.\n"
