She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who ended a casual relationship with a girl because she had slept with a lot of his teammates. He gave two reasons: not dating people who have slept with his friends (using the \"don't shit where you eat\" analogy) and not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes because he might go pro. The girl got hurt, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if his reasons are valid. Setting boundaries is important in relationships. If he felt uncomfortable about her past with his friends, that's his personal boundary. But is it fair to base a decision on that? Some might argue that her past relationships don't affect their current relationship unless it's causing direct issues. However, personal boundaries are valid, even if others don't agree.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who \"goes after athletes.\" That sounds more like a stereotype. Labeling her as a \"ball bunny\" might be sexist, as it judges her based on her choices rather than her character. The question is whether his reasoning is about her actions (which he's okay with) or about stereotypes. If he's judging her based on his assumptions rather than her actual behavior, that's problematic.\n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist, which makes me think the issue is more about gender stereotypes. If the genders were reversed, would the judgment be the same? The author claims he would have the same reaction if the genders were flipped, but that might not hold up. Historically, men are often not judged the same way for similar behavior, so his reasoning might be influenced by double standards.\n\nAlso, communication is key. The author didn't want to tell her the real reasons but admitted to the first one when confronted. That could come off as insincere if there were other factors. The girl was hurt, which shows that his decision affected her emotionally, but does that make him wrong? It's a matter of whether his reasons are justified.\n\nIn summary, while setting boundaries is okay, his reasons may be based on stereotypes and double standards, which could make him at fault. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the sexist implications and judgment based on her past without considering her as an individual. However, some might argue that personal boundaries are valid. But given the context and the mutual friend's reaction, it's likely A.\n"
