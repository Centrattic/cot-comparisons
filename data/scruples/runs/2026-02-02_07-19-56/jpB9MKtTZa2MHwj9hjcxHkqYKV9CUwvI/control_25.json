She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating the girl because of her sexual history with his teammates. The question is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" context, so they want a judgment on whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was casually seeing a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with 12 guys on his football team. He refused to date her, giving two reasons: 1) Not dating someone who's slept with his friends, and 2) Avoiding relationships with women who target athletes. \n\nHe told her the first reason, which she picked up on, and then a mutual friend called him sexist. The author argues that if the genders were reversed, he'd still make the same decision and that he's just avoiding potential drama and insecurity.\n\nTo determine if he's in the wrong, I need to consider ethical standards, societal norms, and personal boundaries. \n\nThe first point about not dating someone who's slept with close friends is a personal boundary. People have different comfort levels, so unless it's a legal or moral violation, it's a personal choice. However, some might argue that judging someone's sexual history is unfair or discriminatory. \n\nThe second reason is about the girl targeting athletes, which the author sees as a \"ball bunny.\" This could be seen as making a judgment based on stereotypes about women who are attracted to athletes. However, the author mentions that if the situation were reversed (him being gay and dating a guy with similar history), he'd still make the same choice. That might suggest he's not being sexist, but rather cautious about his future and potential insecurities.\n\nThe friend's reaction calls him a sexist, which implies that the friend sees the author's decision as discriminatory. But the author's reasoning is based on personal boundaries and avoiding conflict, not on the girl's character. \n\nLegally and ethically, unless the girl's actions are illegal or harmful, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to date her based on his own criteria. However, some might argue that it's unfair to judge someone's past sexual experiences, especially in a society that's moving towards more open-minded views on relationships. \n\nBut the key here is that the author didn't lie. He was upfront about his reasons, even though he only mentioned one of two. However, the girl was hurt, which is understandable. The author might be wrong in his reasoning if the decision is based on outdated or sexist attitudes, but he claims it's about personal boundaries and avoiding drama. \n\nIn the context of AITA, if the author's actions were respectful and he communicated honestly without being discriminatory, he's not in the wrong. But if his reasoning is based on sexist stereotypes (like \"ball bunnies\"), then he might be in the wrong. However, the author defends his stance by saying it's about personal boundaries and future goals, not just the girl's past.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author is setting personal boundaries, even though others might disagree with his reasoning. Unless there's a clear violation of morals or laws, it's his choice. However, the mutual friend's label of \"sexist\" could indicate a societal perspective that sees this as unfair. But the author isn't in the wrong if he's honest and not acting out of malice.\n"
