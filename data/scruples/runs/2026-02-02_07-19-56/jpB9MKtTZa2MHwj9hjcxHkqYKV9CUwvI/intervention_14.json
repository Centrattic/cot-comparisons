She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post. The person is explaining they broke up with a girl because she had slept with many guys on their football team. They gave two reasons: not dating someone who's slept with friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and not wanting to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is based on their personal boundaries. They mention that if the roles were reversed, they'd have the same stance. They also mention not wanting drama and avoiding potential insecurity. However, the mutual friend called them sexist, which adds another layer. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to set their own relationship boundaries. However, judging someone's sexual history as a reason to reject them can be seen as hypocritical or unfair, especially in a society that's moving towards more acceptance of sexual freedom. Also, the second reason, about not dating someone who goes after athletes, could be a red flag for them personally, but might come off as sexist because it's a judgment based on the woman's behavior rather than her character.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction suggests that some people view the author's actions as discriminatory. The author argues they'd feel the same if the girl had their same sexual orientation, but that doesn't necessarily negate the judgment. There's also the aspect of how the rejection was communicated. The girl was hurt, which shows the emotional impact.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is within their right to choose partners based on their preferences, the way they framed their reasons and the judgment of the girl's behavior could make them seem like they're holding double standards or being sexist. Therefore, the answer might be A, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
