She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history with teammates. First, I need to analyze the situation from different angles.\n\nThe author was casually seeing a girl for two months. She slept with 12 guys on his football team, and he refused to date her when she proposed a serious relationship. His reasons are two-fold: he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends (comparing it to not shit where you eat), and he doesn't want to date someone who seems to go after athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" scenario. \n\nThe girl assumed it was because of the teammates, which he confirmed. Then a mutual friend called him sexist. The author argues that if the genders were reversed, his stance would be the same. He also mentions wanting to avoid drama and locker room jokes. \n\nI need to consider relationship ethics here. Is it fair to judge someone's sexual history as a dealbreaker? In many modern perspectives, people have the right to their past sexual experiences without judgment, especially if it's consensual. The author's reasons might be about personal boundaries, but they could also be influenced by stereotypes or insecurity. \n\nThe first reason\u2014no dating people who've slept with friends\u2014might be a personal boundary, but if that's a general rule, it could be seen as avoiding potential drama. However, relationships often involve navigating social circles, and maybe his approach is overly restrictive. \n\nThe second reason is about dating someone who targets athletes. That's more about perception; the author assumes she's after his professional prospects, not him personally. That could be a projection or insecurity on his part. \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction as \"sexist\" might have merit if the author's judgment is based on her gender or his assumptions about her motives. However, if he's applying the same standard regardless of gender, that could mitigate that claim. \n\nBut the key here is whether his actions were wrong. While everyone has their dealbreakers, using someone's sexual history as a reason to end a relationship isn't inherently wrong, but it could be if it's based on unfair stereotypes. The author's reasoning seems to mix personal boundaries with potential insecurity. \n\nIn terms of accountability, if he was honest and respectful in his decision, then it's his right to choose not to pursue a relationship. However, the way he framed it might make others see it as judgmental or sexist, especially if the girl's actions were consensual and her choice to be with athletes. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is enforcing his personal boundaries or making judgments about her character. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. Considering that the author had valid reasons (personal boundaries, career concerns) and communicated it honestly, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the reasons are based on unfair assumptions, then he is.\n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist, which suggests that some might see his reasoning as discriminatory. However, the author argues that gender doesn't affect his decision. Still, the act of judging someone's past sexual behavior can be seen as problematic regardless of gender. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had his reasons, the judgment based on sexual history might be considered holding someone to double standards or making assumptions about her intentions. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn here. The answer could be A or B depending on perspective. However, considering that people have the right to their past experiences and the author's reasons might be more about his own insecurities, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
