She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who was seeing a girl for two months but decided not to date her because she had slept with many of his teammates and he doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy had a boundary of not dating someone who's slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" He also mentions not wanting a relationship with someone who's into athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" situation. He told her the reason, and she was hurt. Then a mutual friend called him sexist.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, personal boundaries are a common thing. People have different standards for relationships. If the guy set these boundaries before getting involved, maybe it's his choice. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with the reasoning. The fact that she slept with many people on his team doesn't inherently make her a \"ball bunny,\" but that's how he perceived it. Also, when he said he didn't want to date her because of that, it might come off as judgmental or using her sexual history as a reason, which could be seen as hypocritical if he himself has similar experiences. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his reasoning is fair.\n\nAnother angle: being honest about his reasons is good, but maybe the way he presented them could have been more considerate. The mutual friend's reaction as a \"sexist asshole\" might stem from the idea that he's judging her based on her sexual behavior, which some people consider unfair. However, if his own boundaries are clear and he's upfront, then it's his choice.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that judging someone's past sexual partners is discriminatory, especially if it's a woman. But others might say that personal boundaries are valid. The key here is whether his actions were respectful. He didn't try to hide the reason, acknowledged her as a cool person, and moved on. So maybe he's not in the wrong because it's his personal choice, but the mutual friend's perspective is also valid regarding potential sexism.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether personal boundaries are considered valid or if the reasoning is seen as discriminatory. The question is asking if he's in the wrong, so if the community or moral standard deems that his reasons are justified, then B (not in the wrong). If they see it as unfair judgment, then A (in the wrong).\n"
