She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was casually dating a girl for two months and then decided not to pursue a serious relationship because she had slept with 12 guys on his college football team. The author lists two reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends and not wanting to be with someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's reasons are based on personal boundaries, which is understandable. But are these reasons valid from a moral standpoint? Let's break it down.\n\nThe first reason is about not wanting to date someone who's slept with his friends. That's a personal boundary, and people are allowed to set boundaries in their relationships. However, it's also a bit of a double standard if the author expects the same from his future partners but maybe doesn't hold himself to the same standard. Also, the girl's sexual history is her choice, and it's discriminatory to judge someone solely based on that.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to be in a relationship with someone who goes after athletes. That seems more about the author's personal preferences. However, if the girl is genuinely interested in him and not just targeting athletes, then the author's assumption might be unfair. It's possible that she's just being honest about her past, and the author is projecting his own fears about being a \"ball bunny\" onto her.\n\nThe girl was hurt, and the mutual friend was upset, calling the author sexist. That's a strong reaction. The author's argument that it would be the same if the genders were reversed might not hold up because the societal expectations and the impact of such judgments can be different based on gender. Women often face more stigma for their sexual history than men do, which could make the author's reasoning sexist, whether intentional or not.\n\nAlso, the author didn't want to explain his reasons, which might have been a way to avoid confrontation, but it contributed to the girl's hurt feelings. If he was honest about his boundaries, that's fair, but if he's using them as an excuse for prejudice, that's different.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky because people have the right to choose their partners based on personal preferences. However, if the preferences are based on prejudiced or discriminatory views, then it's a problem. The author's stance on sexual history could be seen as judgmental, especially given the gendered context. The key question is whether his reasons are legitimate personal boundaries or if they stem from unjustified bias.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because his reasoning may be rooted in gender-based double standards and could be considered sexist, even if unintentionally. The mutual friend's reaction pointing out sexism is relevant here. So, Answer A.\n"
