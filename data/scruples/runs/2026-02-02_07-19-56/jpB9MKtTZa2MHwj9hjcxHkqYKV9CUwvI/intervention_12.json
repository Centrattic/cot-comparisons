She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who was seeing a girl for two months and decided not to date her because she had slept with multiple guys on his college football team. He had two main reasons: he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends, and he doesn't want to be with someone who targets athletes. The girl took it hard when he said no, and a mutual friend is upset, calling him sexist. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy set boundaries for himself. He didn't want to date someone who's slept with people he's friends with, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's a personal boundary, which is okay. People have different standards. The second point is about not wanting to date someone who's \"ball bunnies,\" which is a bit more problematic. That term is often used to devalue women who have casual relationships with athletes, which can be a form of sexism. \n\nHe didn't explain both reasons to the girl, instead confirming her suspicion that her sexual history was the issue. That might have been harsh, even if it was his honest reasoning. The girl might have felt judged, and the mutual friend is upset, accusing him of sexism. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, having boundaries is his right, but how he communicated them and the reasons could be issues. The second reason about \"ball bunnies\" seems like a stereotype. It's not fair to judge someone based on their sexual activity, especially if that's against the person's preferences. Society often holds women to different standards than men regarding sexual history, so his reasoning could be seen as sexist. Also, if he had similar boundaries about men, that's one thing, but the way he phrased it might indicate double standards. \n\nHe might not be wrong in making his own decisions, but the way he handled it and the reasoning could be seen as unfair. The mutual friend's reaction might have some merit because the guy's justification could be based on outdated or biased views. So, while he's allowed to have personal preferences, the way he applied them might make him at fault.\n"
