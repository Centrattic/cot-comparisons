She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author was casually seeing a girl for two months. She's described as nice and attractive, but she's slept with twelve guys from his college football team. When she asked to take things seriously, he declined because two reasons: 1) He doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" and 2) He doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes, fearing she might be a \"ball bunny,\" especially since he has a shot at going pro. \n\nHe admitted to her that her sleeping with his teammates was the issue, which hurt her. Then a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The author argues that if the roles were reversed, he'd make the same choice. He also mentions not wanting the social stigma or potential insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if his reasoning is valid. Personal boundaries are important, so if he's clear about not dating someone who's slept with his friends, that's his choice. But is it fair to judge someone based on their sexual history? Societally, there's a double standard where men often aren't judged as harshly for similar behavior. The girl might feel it's unfair if she's being judged for her past, especially if she's honest and upfront.\n\nThe second point about athletes and \"ball bunnies\" could be a stereotype. Assuming she's after him just because he's an athlete might be unfair. Maybe she's genuinely interested in him, but he's making assumptions based on her past. However, if he's aware of a pattern where she's been with many teammates, it's understandable he might be cautious about her intentions.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction suggests that some people see his decision as sexist. That's a red flag. If the friend's feelings are hurt because he's being called sexist, maybe there's an element of unfair judgment. The author's point about role reversal\u2014if he were gay and the girl was into him, his choice would be same\u2014might not hold because societal expectations differ for different genders. Men are often given more leeway regarding their sexual history compared to women.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting the drama or social teasing. That's about his comfort, which is valid, but it's also about him avoiding potential problems rather than addressing them. Is it his responsibility to handle the jokes or insecurity, or is it reasonable to set boundaries to avoid that?\n\nThe key here is whether the author is right to prioritize his boundaries over her feelings. While he's not wrong in choosing not to date her based on his values, the way he framed it might be seen as judgmental. The fact that he's being called sexist indicates that others might view his reasoning as unfair, especially if the girl isn't doing anything illegal or harmful. \n\nIn dating, people have the right to set boundaries, but when those boundaries are based on societal double standards or stereotypes, it can be problematic. The author's reasoning ties into both his personal boundaries and societal norms. If he's consistent in his standards and communicates them without judgment, it's his choice. However, the mutual friend's reaction suggests that his reasoning might be perceived as discriminatory.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong for having his own boundaries, but others might argue that his reasoning is influenced by sexist attitudes. However, the question is whether he's *in the wrong*. Since he made a choice that aligns with his personal values and boundaries, even if others disagree, he's not necessarily wrong. But there's a nuance here because societal expectations play a role. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because it's his personal choice, even though others may criticize it for being sexist.\n"
