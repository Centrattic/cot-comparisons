She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The author is a college football player who ended a casual relationship because the girl had slept with many of his teammates and he didn't want to date someone who \"goes after athletes.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he gave. He mentioned two main points: not dating someone who's slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and not wanting a relationship with someone who targets athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" scenario. He didn't initially disclose the full reasoning, leading the girl to feel hurt when she asked. Then a mutual friend accused him of sexism.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether his reasons for ending the relationship are valid or if they stem from double standards. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nLooking at societal norms and personal boundaries: people have the right to set their own boundaries in relationships. If the author is uncomfortable with his partner being involved with his close friends, that's a personal boundary. However, the second reason about \"ball bunnies\" might be more about stereotypes. The term \"ball bunny\" often carries a negative connotation implying someone is only interested in athletes for superficial reasons. The author is avoiding such a relationship, which could be seen as a personal preference, but if it's based on gender stereotypes, it might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is important. The friend called the author a sexist asshole, suggesting that the author is applying different standards if the genders were reversed. The author argues that if he were into men and the girl was a man, his stance would remain the same. This could be a defense against being labeled sexist, but it's not a perfect comparison. The situation inherently involves gender roles and societal expectations, which are complex.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: There's no legal wrong here, but ethically, it's about fairness and respect. The author's actions might be ethically questionable if they're based on discriminatory attitudes. However, personal preferences in relationships can vary widely. If both parties were upfront about their expectations from the start, there's less fault. But the author didn't disclose the full reasons initially, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nPsychological impact: The girl felt hurt when the author confirmed her suspicion. Ending a relationship is never easy, and the way he handled it could have been more sensitive. However, the decision itself might not be inherently wrong if it's based on personal boundaries.\n\nIn summary, the author's reasons are personal and based on his own boundaries, which he's entitled to set. However, the potential for gender bias and the way he ended the relationship (without full transparency) could be seen as problematic. The key is whether his reasons are based on objective criteria or stereotypes. If it's the latter, he might be in the wrong. If it's about personal comfort and boundaries, then he's not. The mutual friend's accusation adds another layer, suggesting a possible double standard. I need to weigh these factors.\n"
