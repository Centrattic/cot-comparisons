She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nSo, the author was in a casual relationship with a girl for two months. The girl slept with many guys from the author's college football team. When she asked to start dating, the author refused. His reasons are two-fold: he doesn't date someone who has slept with his friends, and he doesn't date girls who go after athletes, especially if he might go pro.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now asking for an opinion. The answer options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's reasons are based on personal boundaries. He's not forcing her to do anything; he's making a choice based on his own comfort. The first reason is about not wanting to deal with the \"drama\" of sleeping with people you're friends with. That's a common boundary some people have. The second reason is about not wanting to be in a relationship with someone who might be seen as a \"ball bunny,\" which could lead to insecurities or mockery.\n\nBut there's the issue of whether it's sexist. The author claims he would have the same stance if the genders were reversed. However, the mutual friend called him sexist, implying that his judgment is unfair to the woman. So, is it sexist to have such boundaries? It's a tricky point. If the author is applying the same standard regardless of gender, maybe it's not inherently sexist, but if the standard is based on outdated or discriminatory norms, then it could be. \n\nThe girl was hurt by his refusal, but the author tried to explain it was a mismatch in boundaries. The question is whether it's wrong to have those boundaries. People have different moral or personal standards, and as long as it's not based on harmful stereotypes or discrimination, it's their right to set boundaries. However, if the boundary is based on the wrong reasons, like assuming all athletes are promiscuous or that women who have many partners are inherently less suitable for a relationship, that might be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author chose to end the relationship when it became serious because of these reasons. He didn't lie or manipulate; he was honest about his boundaries once confronted. The mutual friend's anger might stem from thinking it's unfair, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If his reasons are his own boundaries and he's not imposing them on others, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if those boundaries are based on sexist or discriminatory beliefs, then yes. The key here is whether the reasons are about his own comfort or about judging the girl's worth. The author says he still thinks she's a cool person, so it might be more about his own preferences than her character. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and consent are key. The author isn't doing something harmful; he's choosing not to continue the relationship. So, unless his reasons are discriminatory or hurtful, he's within his rights. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here because the line between personal choice and prejudice can be thin. If the author's reasoning is based on the idea that women who have had many partners are less suitable for a relationship, that's problematic. However, if he's just saying he's uncomfortable with the situation due to personal boundaries, then it's his choice. The answer would depend on whether the reasons are justifiable. Since the author claims it's about his own boundaries and not her worth, and he was honest, maybe B is the right choice.\n"
