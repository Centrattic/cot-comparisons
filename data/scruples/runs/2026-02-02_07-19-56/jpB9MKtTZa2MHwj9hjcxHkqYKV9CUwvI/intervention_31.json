She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history. The situation is that they were casually seeing each other for two months, and the girl slept with 12 guys on the same football team. He refused to date her because he doesn't date girls who slept with his friends and also doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down his reasons. The first reason is about boundaries\u2014comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" He doesn't want drama, which makes sense. But is it fair to apply that to her past? The second reason is about not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes, fearing being labeled a \"ball bunny.\" That seems more like a personal prejudice. \n\nHe admitted that when she asked directly, he confirmed it was because of the number of partners. The mutual friend called him sexist, which might be valid. The question is whether his reasoning is acceptable. \n\nOn one hand, people have different boundaries, and it's his choice to set them. But on the other hand, judging someone's past sexual history can be seen as discriminatory, especially if it's not relevant to the relationship. Also, his reasoning about \"ball bunnies\" might be a stereotype. \n\nHe argues that if he were into men and this girl was a man, his decision would be the same. That's interesting, but the issue is that he's applying a standard that others might find sexist because it's about her behavior rather than mutual respect. \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction suggests that others see his decision as sexist. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if that's accurate. Is it wrong to have personal preferences, even if they're based on past experiences? The line between personal choice and prejudice is thin here. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is within his rights to choose not to date her, his reasoning could be considered discriminatory. So he might be in the wrong for holding that belief, even if the action is his to take. The answer would be A.\n"
