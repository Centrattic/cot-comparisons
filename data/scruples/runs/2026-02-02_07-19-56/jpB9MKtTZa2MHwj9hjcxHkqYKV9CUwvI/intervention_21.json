She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about him not dating a girl because she had slept with multiple teammates and he's an athlete considering a pro career. He gave two main reasons: not dating people who've slept with his friends and avoiding relationships with someone he sees as a \"ball bunny.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The guy is making a personal choice based on his values. He set a boundary, which is his right. However, the girl might feel that his reasoning is judgmental or based on outdated stereotypes. The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which adds another layer. The question is whether his reasons are valid or if they're discriminatory.\n\nHe mentioned that he wouldn't date someone who slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's a personal boundary, but some might argue that it's a form of shaming others' sexual history. Also, the idea of avoiding \"ball bunnies\" could be seen as sexist because it's a stereotype that women are only interested in athletes for their status. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his preferences. He's not lying; he's just choosing not to pursue a relationship. The girl was hurt, but she might have known his stance if they were seeing each other. However, the mutual friend's reaction suggests that some people view his behavior as sexist, which he disputes by saying he'd have the same issue if the genders were reversed. \n\nI need to weigh personal choice against potential prejudice. While he's not obligated to date someone, using such reasons could be seen as discriminatory. However, it's also about personal compatibility. The answer might depend on cultural context and individual perspectives. In the end, it's a judgment call between personal boundaries and societal expectations.\n"
