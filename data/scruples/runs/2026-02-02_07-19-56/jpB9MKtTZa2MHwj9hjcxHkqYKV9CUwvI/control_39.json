She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is part of a college football team and was casually seeing a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with 12 guys from his team. He turned down her offer to date, explaining he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends (using the \"don't shit where you eat\" analogy) and also mentioned not wanting to be with someone who goes after athletes, especially since he might go pro. The girl found out his reasons, and a mutual friend who has feelings for her is upset, calling the author sexist and an asshole. The author is confused because he thinks if the genders were reversed, the same reasoning would apply.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is the author's decision to not pursue a serious relationship with the girl due to her sexual history with his teammates and her perceived interest in athletes. The question is whether this is fair or if he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, the author says he has always had this boundary. But is it a reasonable one? People have different standards, but some might argue that a person's sexual history shouldn't dictate the worthiness of a relationship. The \"don't shit where you eat\" analogy is a bit harsh, as it's a metaphor for not engaging in something unpleasant in a place you're comfortable. However, in this context, it might be seen as him projecting his own discomfort onto her, which could be problematic.\n\nThe second point is about not wanting to date someone who \"goes after athletes.\" This seems like a broader judgment about people who are attracted to athletes, which might be considered a stereotype. Labeling someone a \"ball bunny\" (a term that can be derogatory) could be seen as sexist because it's making a judgment based on their sexual behavior and interests, which are personal choices. \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction is that the author is sexist. The author claims he wouldn't be different if the genders were reversed, but the friend's perspective is that by focusing on the girl's sexual history with his teammates, he's applying a standard that might not be equally applied to a male partner. If a guy had dated many people, especially teammates, would the author have the same reaction? That's a key question here. The friend likely thinks that the author is being hypocritical or biased because such standards are often applied more to women than men, which can perpetuate double standards.\n\nThe user's reasoning is based on avoiding drama and not wanting to deal with potential insecurities or being \"roasted\" by others. While it's his right to set personal boundaries, the way he's framing his decision might be seen as judgmental. The question is whether this is a valid reason or if it's more about his own insecurities rather than the girl's actions. \n\nAlso, in a relationship, communication is key. He did tell her the reason, which is honest, but the act of ending the relationship because of her past actions might be frowned upon if it's about controlling or limiting her past. Unless there were specific issues like jealousy from the girl or a lack of consent, her past relationships are her own. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? It's a matter of personal choice, but the way he's justifying it by comparing it to a same-sex scenario might not hold up because the situation's dynamics could differ. Additionally, the term \"ball bunny\" is often used to shame women for their sexuality, which can be a sign of sexism even if unintended. \n\nTherefore, while he's allowed to have his own preferences, the way he's explaining it and the reasons might be considered sexist, especially if the friend is implying a double standard. Hence, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
