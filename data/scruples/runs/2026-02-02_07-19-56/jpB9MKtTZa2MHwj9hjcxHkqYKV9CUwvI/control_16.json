She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's not dating a girl because she's slept with 12 guys on his college football team. He gave two reasons: 1) He doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends, and 2) He doesn't want to date someone who's after athletes. The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, and he's arguing that it's about boundaries and not about her being a woman.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if his reasons are valid. The first point is about personal boundaries. He compares it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" meaning he doesn't want drama from his friends. That's a personal choice, but is it fair? If he's friends with these guys, but they've been with his girlfriend, it could lead to tension. But is it his right to judge her based on their past relationships? Some might argue that as long as there's no current or recent connection, it's not his issue. Others might say it's his boundary, and he's not obligated to date someone if that's a problem for him.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who's after athletes. He mentions a \"ball bunny\" which is a derogatory term implying the woman only dates athletes for status or money. But if the girl was already dating multiple people, maybe it's more about her relationship patterns rather than her intent towards athletes. He might be conflating her sexual history with her intentions. Also, the term \"ball bunny\" is often used in a sexist way, so maybe that's contributing to the friend's criticism.\n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist. Is that a valid accusation? If he's applying the same standard to a male's relationships, but the premise here is that he's a man rejecting a woman based on her number of past partners. There's a double standard in society where men are often judged less for similar behavior. So, even if he's consistent in his own views, the societal context might make his reasoning appear sexist. The user says if the girl were a guy and he was into guys, he'd have the same reaction. But that's hypothetical. Also, the number of partners might not be the main issue, but the fact that they're his teammates. It's possible that he's projecting his own insecurities or societal norms onto her.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Being in the wrong would mean he did something that's objectively unethical or disrespectful. His reasoning is based on personal boundaries, which are valid for him, but acting on them could be seen as discriminatory. If he's not forced to date her, then he's not in the wrong for choosing not to. However, if his reasoning is based on harmful stereotypes or double standards, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, how did he communicate his reasons? He admitted it was because of her past relationships, which hurt her. Even if it's his boundary, being honest but kind could mitigate some of the hurt. But the mutual friend's reaction suggests that some see this as sexist. The user might not realize the societal implications of his reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having personal boundaries and choosing not to pursue a relationship. However, the way his reasoning intersects with societal norms and potential sexism makes it a grey area. Since the question is whether he is in the wrong, and personal boundaries are subjective, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here. However, based on the typical AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, if the person is making a judgment based on someone's sexual history, which is often seen as hypocritical or sexist, they might be the asshole. But since he's consistent in his own standards and it's about his comfort, the answer could be B. But I need to check if the answer is strictly based on whether it's wrong or not. If the answer is AITA, in the Reddit context, people might say he's not the asshole because it's his choice, but others might argue it's sexist. However, the user is asking for a yes or no based on whether he's in the wrong. Given that personal preferences are allowed, unless it's discriminatory, then B (No) would be the answer.\n"
