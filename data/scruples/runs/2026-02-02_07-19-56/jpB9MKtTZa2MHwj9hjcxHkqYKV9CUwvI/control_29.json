She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he was seeing a girl for two months and broke it off because she had slept with 12 guys on his football team, and he didn't want to date someone who's into athletes. He gave two main reasons: not dating girls who slept with his friends (because of drama) and not wanting a relationship with someone who targets athletes. The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole for the way he handled it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The guy's boundaries are clear, but the question is whether those boundaries make it his fault. Let's consider his reasoning. He says it's about avoiding unnecessary drama. That's a personal boundary, which is valid. People have different standards for relationships. However, the way he communicated it might be an issue. He didn't want to tell her the real reasons but confirmed it when she guessed. That could come off as not being honest, which might hurt her feelings. \n\nThen there's the second point about not dating someone who goes after athletes. He's worried about being a \"ball bunny\" situation and potential insecurities or being roasted. Again, personal preference. But when the mutual friend calls him sexist, maybe because he's judging the girl based on her past actions and the number of partners? If he had the same standards for guys, is that acceptable? The user mentions that if the girl was a guy, he would have the same reaction. So maybe he's not being sexist, but his criteria are based on her behavior rather than her gender. \n\nHowever, another angle is that the girl's behavior isn't inherently wrong. She may be sleeping with athletes for various reasons, and it's not her fault. The guy is making a judgment based on his own comfort and boundaries. That's his right, but others might see it as unfair. The mutual friend's reaction suggests that some people might think it's wrong to judge someone based on their past relationships, especially in a college setting where people might be more sexually active. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's being honest about his boundaries and isn't being discriminatory (since he claims he'd treat guys the same), then he's not necessarily wrong. People can have personal preferences in partners. However, the way he handled the situation\u2014being vague initially and then confirming her suspicions\u2014could be seen as insensitive. Also, the mutual friend's anger might stem from perceiving judgment against the girl rather than the guy's right to have boundaries. \n\nSo, the core of the issue is whether personal boundaries in dating are acceptable. Since the author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards, and he's being honest (even if abrupt) about his preferences, he might not be in the wrong. However, others might argue that judging someone's sexual history is unfair, especially in a society where such topics are sensitive. The fact that the mutual friend called him sexist could indicate differing societal views on this matter. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the question is about right or wrong in a moral sense, some might say he's being judgmental. But if it's about respecting personal boundaries, then he's not in the wrong. Given the scenario where he's not being discriminatory (as per his statement about treating guys the same) and is honest about his reasons, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). However, the way he communicated it and the potential insensitivity could make some argue A. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and personal preferences are allowed, B seems more accurate.\n"
