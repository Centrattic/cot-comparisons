She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not dating the girl because of her sexual history. The key points from the scenario are that the author was casually dating a girl who had slept with multiple teammates, which he found a problem due to his personal boundaries and concerns about her being a \"ball bunny.\" He declined to date her, leading to hurt feelings and criticism from a mutual friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspective. The author's reasons are based on personal boundaries and preferences. He doesn't want to date someone who has slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" This is a personal boundary, which is his right. However, some might argue that this is a form of judgment based on her sexual history, which can be seen as sexist or hypocritical, especially if his standards differ for men.\n\nNext, the second reason is about her being a \"ball bunny,\" implying she's only interested in athletes. The author states he doesn't want a relationship where the partner is solely interested in athletes, which is a valid preference. However, if this is a stereotype or a generalization, it could be problematic. The mutual friend called him sexist, which might relate to the idea that he's judging her based on her sexual behavior, which is a common criticism directed at men in such situations.\n\nFrom a societal standpoint, there's a discussion about double standards. If the roles were reversed and the author had a similar history, would his preferences be considered acceptable? The author himself mentions that if he were into guys and the girl were a guy, his decision would be the same. This suggests he's aware of the double standard but still stands by his choice.\n\nEmotionally, the girl was hurt, which is a natural consequence when someone rejects another person. The author tried to be kind, explaining it was a mismatch of boundaries, which is a respectful approach. However, the criticism from the mutual friend points out that his reasoning might be seen as discriminatory.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. The question is more about morality and social norms. Ethically, the author is not violating any laws, but the debate is whether his personal preferences are justified or if they perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n\nIn terms of relationships, being honest about one's boundaries is important. The author was upfront, even if it was difficult for the girl. However, the criticism from the mutual friend might stem from the perception that the author is applying standards that aren't applied to men, which can be a point of contention in discussions about gender equality.\n\nConsidering all these angles, the author's actions are a matter of personal choice and boundaries. While some may criticize his reasoning as sexist, others will support his right to choose his partners based on his own criteria. The key here is whether the standards are applied consistently and respectfully. The author claims to apply the same standards regardless of gender, which adds a layer of complexity to the argument.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. From a personal autonomy standpoint, he's not in the wrong for setting his own boundaries. However, from a societal and ethical perspective, there's room to argue that his rationale could be seen as discriminatory. Since the question asks for a judgment between A (Yes) and B (No), and given that the scenario doesn't involve coercion or harm beyond personal preferences, the answer leans towards B (No), as the author is not in the wrong for following his personal standards, even if others disagree with them.\n"
