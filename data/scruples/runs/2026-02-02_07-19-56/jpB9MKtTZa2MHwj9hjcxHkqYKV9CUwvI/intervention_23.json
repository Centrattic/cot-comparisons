She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who ended things with a girl he was dating because she had slept with many of his teammates. The guy gives two reasons: not wanting to date someone who's slept with his friends and not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions were justified. The first reason is about not dating someone who's slept with his friends. That's a personal boundary, which I can understand. But is it fair to have such a boundary? Some people might find that judgmental, while others respect personal limits. The second reason is about not wanting to date a \"ball bunny\" because he might go pro. That's a common stereotype, and judging someone based on their dating history and their interest in athletes could be seen as sexist or superficial.\n\nThe girl was hurt, and the mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The author says he would have the same reaction if the genders were reversed. But that reasoning might not hold up because the issue isn't about gender but about personal preferences and stereotypes. The author is using the girl's relationships as a reason to end things, which could be seen as holding her to an unfair standard. \n\nAlso, the author's concern about being roasted or dealing with insecurities might be more about his own issues rather than hers. While everyone has the right to set boundaries, if those boundaries are based on stereotypes or double standards, they can be problematic. The key here is whether the author's reasons are valid or if they're using them to avoid deeper issues or personal biases.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author's actions are based on superficial and potentially sexist reasons. Even if it's a personal boundary, the way he justified it and dismissed her without considering her perspective might make him at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe some see it as personal choice. Hmm.\n"
