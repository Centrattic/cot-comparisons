She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history. The situation is that the girl slept with 12 guys on his football team, and he's not interested in dating her because of that and because he doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The author's reasoning is based on personal boundaries. He mentions two main points: not dating someone who has slept with his friends (using the \"don't shit where you eat\" analogy) and not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes. He also clarifies that he wouldn't have a different opinion if the roles were reversed, suggesting he's not sexist. \n\nNow, considering personal boundaries. People have different standards for relationships, and it's common to have deal-breakers. If this is something he's always had as a boundary, it's his right to decide not to pursue a relationship. However, others might see this as judgmental or hypocritical, especially if the girl isn't doing anything illegal or harmful. The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which implies some people find his reasoning problematic.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, there's more acceptance of people's sexual histories, and some might view his criteria as unfair, especially if the girl's actions don't directly affect him. But if the author feels it's a personal deal-breaker, it's about mutual respect. The girl was hurt, but he tried to explain it's a boundary, not a reflection on her as a person.\n\nAnother angle is the mutual friend's reaction. If the friend has feelings for her, he might be projecting or trying to help her. The author's response about not caring if the roles were reversed (if the girl was a guy) is a point against him being sexist. However, the question remains whether his boundaries are valid.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the author isn't in the wrong if he's honest and respectful. He didn't lie and clarified it's a personal choice. But some people might argue that his standards are shallow or based on stereotypes about athletes and relationships. However, unless there's any coercion or harm, it's his prerogative to set his own boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because it's about personal choice and boundaries, even if others disagree. The key is that he was honest and didn't force the relationship, just made a decision based on his values.\n"
