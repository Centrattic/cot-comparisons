She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author was casually seeing a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with at least 12 guys from his college football team. When she asked to start dating, he said no. His reasons were two-fold: he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and he doesn't want to date someone who seems to target athletes, fearing it might be a \"ball bunny\" situation. He confirmed her suspicion about her sexual history being the reason, which hurt her, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Is it fair to judge someone based on their sexual history? In many modern perspectives, someone's past relationships or sexual partners aren't a valid reason to reject them unless it's affecting the current relationship. The author is setting a boundary about not dating people who've had relationships with his friends, but is that a reasonable boundary? It might be a personal choice, but it could also be seen as holding a grudge or being overly judgmental.\n\nThe second reason is about her potentially being a \"ball bunny,\" which is a derogatory term implying she's only interested in athletes for their status or money. This reason could be based on stereotypes rather than actual behavior. The author claims he wouldn't mind if the situation were reversed, but that's a hypothetical scenario. The real issue here is whether his reasons are valid or if they stem from prejudice.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction calls out potential sexism. If the author had the same boundary for a guy and the roles were reversed, would it still be acceptable? That's a key point. The friend's anger suggests that the author's reasoning is indeed sexist because he's judging her based on her sexual history, which is a common issue in gender dynamics.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while people have the right to set personal boundaries, using someone's past relationships as a deal-breaker can be problematic. It's also important to consider if the author is being hypocritical or if his reasons are legitimate. The mutual friend's reaction adds another layer, indicating that the community might view his actions as unfair.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to his personal preferences, applying them in a way that discriminates based on gender or stereotypes might make him the asshole. The key is whether his reasons are justified and respectful. Since his reasoning could be seen as sexist and judgmental, the answer would lean towards AITA being in the wrong.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. His decision to reject the woman based on her sexual history and perceived intentions (labeling her a \"ball bunny\") perpetuates harmful stereotypes and double standards. Judging someone solely on their past relationships or their choice of partners is inherently sexist and dismissive of their autonomy. While personal boundaries are valid, his reasoning relies on outdated gender norms and unfair assumptions, making him the asshole.",
