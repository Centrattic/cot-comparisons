She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author was casually seeing a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with 12 guys from his college football team, including him being part of that team. When she asked to try dating, he said no. His reasons: 1) He doesn't date people who've slept with his friends (compares it to \"don't shit where you eat\"), and 2) He doesn't want to date someone who's going after athletes, fearing a \"ball bunny\" reputation. After he told her, she guessed the reason, and he confirmed it. They parted ways, and a mutual friend got angry, calling him sexist. The author doesn't see why, saying if roles were reversed, he'd have the same stance. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The author's reasons are about personal boundaries. He's stating his own deal-breakers. However, the issue is that his reasons are based on her sexual history and her interactions with his team. \n\nIn modern dating, someone's past sexual partners shouldn't be a deal-breaker unless both parties have agreed on boundaries beforehand. The author is making a judgment based on her history, which some might see as judgmental or hypocritical, especially since he's part of a team that might have a party culture. The term \"ball bunny\" is derogatory and stigmatizes women who choose to date athletes, which could be considered sexist. Even if he's being honest about his preferences, labeling someone negatively and using that as a reason to reject them could be seen as unfair.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction is also a point. If the friend thinks he's sexist, maybe there's a societal expectation that judging someone's past is not acceptable. The author argues that if the roles were reversed, his stance would be the same. However, that doesn't necessarily justify it. People can have personal preferences, but acting on them without considering the other person's feelings might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is clear that he didn't want to deal with potential drama or insecurity. It's his right to set boundaries. The problem arises when those boundaries are based on prejudice or unfair judgments. The fact that he admitted her being with his teammates was the main issue suggests it's more about his own comfort than her actions directly affecting him negatively beyond his perception.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Is judging someone by their sexual history fair? 2) Is using the term \"ball bunny\" sexist? 3) Does the author have a right to set such personal boundaries?\n\nIn many cases, people argue that as long as both parties are consenting adults, their past relationships shouldn't matter. The author's reasoning might be seen as outdated or sexist. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for making a judgment based on her history and using a derogatory term. However, others might say he's just being honest about his preferences. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering societal views on sexism and judgmental attitudes, the answer likely leans towards A (he is in the wrong).\n"
