She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history with his teammates.\n\nFirst, the man was casually seeing a girl for two months. She's described as nice and attractive. The key points are that she slept with 12 guys on his college football team, and he refuses to date her because of that. His reasons are two-fold: 1) He doesn't date women who have slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\"), and 2) He doesn't want a relationship with someone who's into athletes because he might go pro. \n\nHe then tells her the main reason is the sexual history, which upsets her. A mutual friend gets angry, calling him sexist. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is it fair to judge someone based on their sexual history? The man's reasoning seems to be about his personal boundaries and comfort. He's not necessarily saying she's a bad person but that their values don't align. However, in modern relationships, judging someone's past sexual behavior can be seen as hypocritical or sexist, especially since the woman's actions are her own choice. The idea that he's uncomfortable with her sleeping with his teammates could lead to jealousy or drama, but it's also a personal choice to avoid that situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the mutual friend's anger suggests that some might see his reasoning as discriminatory. If he had the same issue with a male partner's sexual history, it might be more accepted, but since it's a female, it could be viewed as double standards. The man claims that if the roles were reversed (if he were into men and she was a man sleeping with his friends), he'd have the same issue. However, that's a hypothetical and doesn't address current societal norms where such judgments are often frowned upon.\n\nSo, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspectives. If personal boundaries are respected, then maybe not. But if society is moving towards accepting that people's past choices shouldn't dictate current relationships, then he might be in the wrong. Also, the mutual friend's reaction implies that others see his actions as sexist, which could mean he's in the right in terms of his own preferences but wrong in how it's perceived. \n\nI think the key is that while he's allowed to have his own boundaries, judging someone for their past behavior in a way that could be seen as discriminatory might make him in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
