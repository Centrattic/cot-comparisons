She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was seeing a girl for two months and decided not to date her because she slept with multiple guys on his college football team, including friends. They also mention not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes because they might end up in a pro relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author has personal boundaries: not dating someone who's slept with friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and not wanting a relationship where the partner is after athletes. These are their personal choices, right? The question is whether it's wrong to have those boundaries.\n\nOn one hand, the author is honest about their reasons. They didn't lie when the girl asked why they didn't want to date. They also said they thought she was cool but it was a mismatch. So, they handled it respectfully, even if the reason is controversial. But then there's the mutual friend who called them a sexist asshole. That part might indicate that others see it as sexist because the reason is based on the girl's sexual history. The author argues that if the genders were reversed, they wouldn't care, but does that hold up? If the girl was into guys and the author was a guy sleeping with his friends, would that be the same? Maybe, but in reality, the stigma around women's sexual history is different from men's, so the mutual friend might see it as double standard.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't forcing the girl to do anything; they're just deciding not to date her for personal reasons. As long as their reasons aren't harmful or based on prejudice, maybe it's their right to set those boundaries. However, if those reasons are rooted in sexist attitudes (e.g., judging the girl for her past relationships when men aren't judged the same way), then it might be wrong.\n\nThe \"ball bunny\" comment could be problematic too. That term is often used to describe women who pursue athletes, implying they're only interested in the athlete's status or money. If the author is using that term pejoratively, it might reflect negatively on them. Also, the author mentions not wanting the drama or potential insecurity, which are valid personal feelings.\n\nIn summary, it's a judgment call. The author is being honest and setting boundaries, which is okay. However, if the mutual friend is right and it's sexist because the girl's sexual history is being used to dismiss her, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the author genuinely believes that their boundaries are about personal comfort and not based on gender stereotypes, then they might not be wrong. The key is whether the reasoning is based on prejudice or personal choice without judgment. Since the author doesn't force the girl to stay in a relationship and is clear about their reasons, perhaps they aren't in the wrong. But societal expectations might see it differently. I think it's a bit of both, but the decision to not date someone based on their past relationships, while controversial, might not be inherently wrong if the person isn't being discriminated against. So I'm leaning towards B (No).\n"
