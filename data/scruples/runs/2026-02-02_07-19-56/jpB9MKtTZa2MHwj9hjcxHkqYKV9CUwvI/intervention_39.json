She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who refused to date a girl because she had slept with multiple guys on his college football team. The author gave two main reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends and not wanting to date someone who's into athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is being honest about his boundaries, which is fair. People have different deal-breakers in relationships. For example, some people might not date someone who smokes or has certain political views. So, if this is a personal boundary he's always had, is that wrong? It's not illegal or unethical to have personal standards, right?\n\nBut then there's the aspect of judging someone's sexual history. While the author might have his reasons, some people might see that as sexist because it's making a judgment based on a woman's past. The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which could mean others perceive it that way. However, the author argues that if roles were reversed, he'd have the same stance, so it's not about gender but about personal boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't want to share the real reason at first but ended up confirming her suspicion. Being honest is important, but the way it was handled might have been hurtful. However, the girl was told it was a mismatch in boundaries, which is a reasonable explanation. The author also said he thought she was a cool person, so it's not a personal attack.\n\nThere's also the social aspect of the football team. The author mentions not wanting to deal with jokes or insecurity. That's about his own comfort, which is valid. But is it fair to judge someone's dating history for that reason? Some might say it's a personal choice, others might see it as avoiding potential issues by not addressing them.\n\nThe key points are: personal boundaries vs. judgment, honesty in communication, and potential sexism. While the author's reasons are personal and valid for him, some might argue that it's wrong to have such strict criteria based on sexual history, especially in a judgmental way. However, others might agree that it's okay to have such boundaries if they're consistently applied.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether one's personal boundaries are considered acceptable. If the author is honest and doesn't act hypocritically, then maybe it's not in the wrong. But if it's seen as discriminatory, then yes. The mutual friend's reaction suggests others might find it sexist, but the author claims it's not about gender. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because people have the right to their own boundaries in relationships, as long as they're not discriminatory. The author isn't attacking her character but stating personal incompatibility. However, some might disagree due to the judgment on sexual history. But since he's consistent and honest, it's his choice.\n"
