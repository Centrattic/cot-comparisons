She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ended a casual relationship with a girl because she had slept with many of his football teammates and he didn't want to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main reasons are about boundaries: not dating people who've slept with his friends and avoiding a relationship with a \"ball bunny.\" He also mentions the potential for drama and being mocked. The girl was hurt, and a mutual friend called him sexist.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries in relationships. If the author felt uncomfortable with her sexual history and the dynamic with his teammates, that's his personal choice. It's not illegal or unethical for him to have those boundaries. However, some might argue that making a judgment based on her past sexual partners could be seen as hypocritical or sexist, especially if he's making assumptions about her behavior. But he mentions that if the situation were reversed (e.g., if a guy had similar history and he was into guys), his stance would remain the same. That suggests consistency in his reasoning.\n\nThe mutual friend's anger might stem from viewing the author's choice as unfair or judgmental. But the author isn't obligated to explain his reasons in detail, and it's his right to decide who he wants to be in a relationship with. The key here is consent and mutual respect. The girl wasn't forced into anything; she was told his reasons and they parted amicably. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's decision is based on outdated or narrow views about purity and relationships, potentially leading to sexist attitudes. However, the author isn't making moral judgments about her past but rather about the potential for conflict in their specific context. \n\nIn summary, the author is making a personal choice based on his comfort level and boundaries. As long as his reasoning isn't discriminatory or harmful (and he's not being hypocritical), it's a matter of personal preference. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
