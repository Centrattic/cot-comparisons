Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not dating the girl because of her sexual history and her interactions with his football team.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was casually dating a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's had relationships with 12 guys on his college football team. When she asked to take things seriously, he declined, citing two main reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and not wanting a relationship with someone who goes after athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" scenario. The girl got hurt, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The author defends his stance by saying if the genders were reversed, he'd act the same, and he doesn't want the drama or potential insecurity from being with someone with that reputation.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break down the arguments. He mentions personal boundaries, which are valid. People have different standards for relationships. If his boundary is not dating someone who has been with his friends, that's his choice. However, the problem might be in the way he communicated it and the implications of his reasoning.\n\nFirst, the issue of sexual history. In many contexts, people shouldn't judge others based on their past relationships unless there's a relevant reason. The author's reasoning here seems to be more about his own comfort and avoiding drama rather than any betrayal or issue with the girl. The girl wasn't doing anything wrong by sleeping with others; that's her personal life. But the author feels uncomfortable because of his friends. That's a personal choice, but some might see it as judgmental or holding a double standard, especially in a society that's moving towards more acceptance of diverse sexual histories.\n\nThen there's the \"ball bunny\" concern. The term \"ball bunny\" has a derogatory connotation, implying someone is only interested in athletes for their social status or image. The author is worried she's after athletes generally, not him specifically. That sounds like a stereotype. It's possible that his judgment is based on assumptions rather than evidence. The girl's past doesn't necessarily indicate her current intentions. He might be making a snap judgment based on her history rather than who she is now.\n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist because he's making a decision based on her sexual history, which could be seen as holding her to a standard he wouldn't apply to a male partner. The author claims he would act the same if the genders were reversed, but that's not entirely accurate. If he were in her position and she had similar boundaries, the scenario would be different. Also, the \"don't shit where you eat\" analogy might be a way to justify his own discomfort without considering her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, personal boundaries are important in relationships. If someone has a reason to be uncomfortable, they have the right to set those boundaries. The author isn't forcing the relationship; he's choosing not to pursue it. However, the way he frames his reasoning might contribute to the hurt feelings. By confirming it's about her past relationships, he's revealing that his decision is based on her history, which could be seen as unfair. Also, the term \"ball bunny\" is inherently judgmental and could be discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for having his own boundaries. But there's a question about whether his reasoning is valid or if it's a form of double standard or judgment. If he's applying the same standard to everyone regardless of gender, then it's his choice. However, the societal context is that such judgments are often criticized as sexist when applied to women's sexual histories. So even if he's consistent in his own mind, others might see it as sexist because it imposes a standard that's not typically held for men in the same way.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction suggests that the action is perceived as sexist. If the author's reasoning is indeed based on a double standard, then he could be in the wrong. But if he's being honest about his boundaries without malice, it's a matter of personal choice. The line between personal choice and judgment is thin here. The key is whether his reasoning is respectful and based on valid reasons, not harmful stereotypes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't the one initiating harm (he's choosing not to date her), his reasoning might be based on stereotypes and double standards. The answer hinges on whether his boundaries are considered fair and non-discriminatory. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the mutual friend called him sexist, there's a case to be made that he's in the wrong for holding a judgmental standard. However, others might argue that he's within his rights to set his own boundaries. Given the context and the societal critique of such judgments, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong (A).\n"
