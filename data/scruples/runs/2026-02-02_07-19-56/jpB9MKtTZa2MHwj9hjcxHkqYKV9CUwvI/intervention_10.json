She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was casually seeing a girl for two months. She's a nice person and attractive, but she's slept with at least 12 guys from his college football team. When she asked if they could date, he said no, giving two reasons: he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\"), and he doesn't date girls who go after athletes because he's aiming to go pro and doesn't want a \"ball bunny.\" The girl was hurt, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his reasons are valid. The first reason is about boundaries. He says he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends. That seems like a personal boundary, which is okay, but is it a valid reason? Some might argue that a person's past sexual history shouldn't affect whether you date them. However, if someone is uncomfortable with that, maybe it's their choice. But there's also the aspect of double standards. He mentions that if he were into guys and this girl was a guy he was sleeping with, he'd still feel the same. But does that apply? If he's straight, then the comparison might not be accurate. Also, if his friends are okay with her sleeping with them, maybe there's a different dynamic. But it's his choice to set that boundary.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who targets athletes. He's worried about being seen as a \"ball bunny,\" which is a term often used pejoratively for women who date athletes. This could be seen as sexist because it's making a judgment based on her intentions and not her actual behavior. He might be stereotyping her as only after his success rather than considering her as a person. Even if she's dated many athletes, that doesn't necessarily mean she's only after that. It's a generalization. Also, if he's concerned about his own potential insecurity or others' reactions, that's his issue, but he's projecting that onto her.\n\nThe mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which is a strong reaction. If he's making a judgment based on her past sexual behavior, that could be seen as sexist. The problem here is whether his reasons are based on her actions or his own biases. If he's not dating her because of her past relationships with his friends, that's a personal choice, but if it's a double standard or based on stereotypes, then it's more problematic.\n\nAnother angle is whether it's fair to judge someone's worth based on their sexual history. Many people believe that a person's past sexual partners shouldn't affect their current relationships. The fact that he's comfortable with his friends sleeping with her but not with himself might be a double standard. Also, the idea that a woman who dates many people is a \"ball bunny\" is a sexist label that's used to shame women for their sexual activity, especially if they're in relationships with athletes.\n\nHe did tell her the reason after being pressed, and she was hurt. Even if his reasons are personal, being honest is good, but maybe the way he framed it could be seen as judgmental. The mutual friend's reaction suggests that some people see this as unfair or sexist.\n\nSo, putting it all together: is he in the wrong? His decision to not date her is his personal choice, but the reasons might be based on sexist stereotypes (ball bunny) and potentially double standards. The first reason is a personal boundary, but the second is more problematic. Since he's making a judgment based on her past and her associations, which could be seen as sexist, he might be in the wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for his decision. If it's purely his choice, then maybe not. But the way he's framing his reasons could be considered sexist, which makes him in the wrong.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reasons include sexist attitudes and potential double standards.\n"
