She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who was casually seeing a girl for two months and decided not to date her because she had slept with 12 guys on his college football team. He gives two main reasons: he doesn't date girls who have slept with his friends, and he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author mentions that he has a boundary of not dating someone who has slept with his friends. That's his personal choice, right? It's about his comfort level. Even if others might think it's unfair, as long as he's not violating any laws or ethical standards, it's his right to set that boundary. But some people might argue that it's sexist because it's about her sexual history, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nThen there's the second point about dating someone who \"goes after athletes.\" He's concerned about being in a relationship with a \"ball bunny,\" which can have a negative connotation. But again, this is his personal preference. However, if he's using that as a blanket reason without considering her individual character, it could be seen as stereotyping or making assumptions. \n\nThe girl was hurt when he told her the reason. That's a valid emotional response. But the author did try to explain it was a mismatch of boundaries and that he thought she was cool. The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which adds another layer. The author argues that if the roles were reversed, he would feel the same way, which he might be using to justify his actions as not sexist. But does that actually address the potential sexism? If he's using her sexual history as a reason to reject her, it could be seen as holding her to a standard he wouldn't apply to himself, which is a classic example of double standards in relationships.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that dating someone with that reputation would lead to being roasted by others. That's about his own insecurities or concerns about social judgment. It's not necessarily her fault, but using that as a reason might not be fair to her. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky because personal relationships often involve subjective preferences. But if the author's reasons are based on her past actions that don't affect their relationship directly (like past sexual partners), some might say it's judgmental or unfair. On the other hand, he's not making her do anything; he's just choosing not to pursue a relationship. \n\nThe key here is whether his reasons are valid for him. If he's being honest about his boundaries, then maybe it's not wrong. But if he's applying a double standard or basing his decision on stereotypes, then he might be in the wrong. The mutual friend's reaction suggests that some people see it as sexist, but the author claims it's not, saying he'd feel the same if the genders were swapped. However, in reality, men and women are often held to different standards regarding sexual history, so his argument might not fully address the potential sexism.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author is making a choice based on her past actions that he's comfortable with, and he's not forcing her to do anything, he's probably not in the wrong. However, some might argue that his reasoning is hypocritical or sexist. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong. If the answer is about whether he's a bad person or if it's acceptable, then maybe it's not wrong, but the judgment is on her for sleeping with team members. But in terms of personal choice, it's his right. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
