She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history. The situation involves the girl having slept with multiple guys on the author's college football team, which he's part of. He refused to date her, giving two main reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends and not wanting to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if there's any wrongdoing here. The author's reasons are about personal boundaries and preferences. He's making a choice based on what he's comfortable with. That's his right. However, the mutual friend called him sexist, which might be a point to consider. But the key here is whether his decision is valid or if it's discriminatory.\n\nThe author argues that if the girl were a guy and he was into guys, his decision would be the same. That's a point about consistency. But the issue here is whether it's fair to judge someone's sexual history so harshly. In some contexts, people might argue that it's a personal choice and not the business of others. However, the author is not judging her morality but setting boundaries based on his own comfort and potential social dynamics (like jealousy or team dynamics). \n\nThe question of whether he's in the wrong depends on societal norms and individual rights. While he's not obligated to date someone just because they're available, if his reasoning is based on stereotypes (like \"ball bunnies\"), that could be problematic. But if it's purely about his own boundaries and not discriminating based on protected categories, it's more about personal choice. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether his reasons are valid personal boundaries or if they cross into prejudice. Since he's explaining his own comfort level, it's more about his preferences, not necessarily being in the wrong.\n"
