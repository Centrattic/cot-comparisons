She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who was seeing a girl for two months and decided not to date her because she had slept with 12 guys on his college football team. He gave two reasons: he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes because he might go pro.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The first reason is about personal boundaries. Some people have boundaries about their partner's past, but is that acceptable? It could be seen as a personal choice, but if it's based on the number of partners, that might be more about the person's past rather than their current behavior. The second reason is about her being a \"ball bunny,\" which could be a stereotype. Using someone's sexual history to judge their character might be problematic. \n\nAlso, the girl was hurt when he told her. The author claims it's about boundaries, but some might argue that it's unfair to judge someone based on their past relationships, especially in a team sport context where social dynamics can be different. The mutual friend called him sexist, which is a strong accusation. If the guy had been in a similar situation (e.g., with a guy), would his reaction be the same? The author says yes, but that might not address the underlying issue of judging a woman's sexual history, which can be seen as double standards.\n\nThe key points here are consent and judgment. The girl's past sexual partners don't affect his current relationship with her unless there's a breach of trust. Since they were only casually seeing each other, maybe there were no prior discussions about exclusivity. The author's decision is based on his own discomfort, which is valid, but the way he framed it might be seen as shaming her for her past. \n\nAlso, the term \"ball bunny\" is a stereotype that can demean women who are interested in athletes, implying they're only after them for their status. That's a negative stereotype and could contribute to the judgment being unfair. \n\nSo, considering all that, even though the author's reasons are his personal boundaries, the way he applied them could be seen as judgmental and possibly sexist. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's making a decision based on her past without considering her as an individual beyond that. The mutual friend's reaction as sexist might have some validity because the issue is her sexual history, not her behavior towards him. \n\nBut I should also consider that everyone has the right to set their own boundaries. However, if those boundaries are based on outdated or biased views, they might be problematic. The answer could hinge on whether the decision is a personal choice or a morally wrong judgment. In this case, the author is prioritizing his own comfort over the girl's feelings, which might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that the author's reasoning might be flawed because he's using her past sexual partners as a reason to reject her, which can be seen as a form of judgment that's not necessarily fair or respectful. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
