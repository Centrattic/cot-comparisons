She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was seeing a girl for two months and decided not to date her because she had slept with many guys on his college football team. The author has two main reasons: not dating people who have slept with friends (the \"don't shit where you eat\" principle) and not wanting a relationship with someone who goes after athletes, fearing it could affect his pro prospects.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's reasons are based on personal boundaries, which are valid. People have different values and what they're comfortable with. However, there's a potential issue with double standards. The author mentions that if the situation were reversed (he was into guys and she was a guy), he'd have the same reaction. But does that hold up? Also, the mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which suggests some people view his reasoning as discriminatory.\n\nAnother angle: the girl in question is sleeping with multiple people on the team. The author isn't judging her for her sexual history per se but for the fact that those people are his friends and teammates. Is that fair? It's about personal comfort and boundaries. However, judging someone based on their sexual partners, especially if they're not in a relationship with those people, can be seen as holding them accountable for others' actions. But the author isn't saying she's doing something wrong; he's just not comfortable with the situation.\n\nThe second reason is about her being a \"ball bunny.\" That term has a negative connotation and often implies that the person is only after the athletes for their status or money. But if the girl is genuinely interested in the team members, does that make her a \"ball bunny\"? Or is the author making an assumption based on her behavior? This could be a form of stereotyping.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction adds another layer. If the friend has feelings for the girl, they might see the author's decision as harsh. But does that affect the morality of the author's choice? The author's actions led to hurt feelings, but if he was upfront about his reasons, maybe it's a matter of differing views on relationships.\n\nIn terms of AITA rules, the key is whether the author acted wrongfully. Personal boundaries are subjective, so unless there's something morally wrong with the girl's actions (which there isn't just because she's dating others), the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to date her. However, the way he framed his reasons might come off as judgmental or discriminatory, which could lead others to think he's in the wrong. But the core issue is his right to set his own boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether personal boundaries are considered acceptable reasons. If the author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by setting these boundaries, then he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that his reasoning is sexist or judgmental. But the AITA subreddit tends to consider the context and personal choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; he's just making a choice based on his values.\n"
