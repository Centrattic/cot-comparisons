She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history with his teammates. I need to analyze the situation based on the points he made and the reactions from others.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: he doesn't date girls who have slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's a boundary he's set. Then, he's against dating girls who target athletes, fearing it might affect his professional prospects. He admitted to her that it was because of the teammates, and she was hurt. A mutual friend called him a sexist asshole.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and whether they're justified. The author argues it's about avoiding drama and not wanting to date someone seen as a \"ball bunny.\" But is this a valid reason? Personal boundaries are subjective. If he's okay with the person but not their history, that can be a matter of personal preference. However, the friend's reaction suggests he might have come across as sexist, even if he doesn't see it that way.\n\nHe mentions that if the situation were reversed (he was into guys and she was a guy), he'd have the same stance. That implies he's applying the same standard, which might mitigate accusations of sexism. However, the issue is whether his reasons are based on her behavior or societal stereotypes. If he's avoiding her because he thinks athletes shouldn't date someone who's with many teammates, that might be a bias against women in general, not just her specific actions.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was upfront about his reasons once pressed might show honesty, but it's still about her past relationships. The mutual friend's anger could stem from perceiving it as a judgment on the girl's character, which might not be fair, but the author believes he's standing by his boundaries.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at whether the decision harms others or is based on invalid prejudice. Here, the author isn't causing harm beyond ending a relationship, but his reasoning could be seen as discriminatory. If his boundary is about his own comfort and not judging her character, it's more about personal preference. But if it's a blanket rule that targets women's sexual history, that's problematic.\n\nThe author's stance might be a personal choice, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his reasons are justifiable as personal boundaries or if they cross into harmful stereotypes. Since he's applying the same standard regardless of gender (as he mentioned the hypothetical scenario), it's more about his own preferences. However, using someone's sexual history as a deal-breaker for a relationship, especially in a context where athletes might be more sexually active, could be seen as discriminatory even if not intended.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having personal boundaries, but others might view his reasoning as sexist. However, since he's not forcing his views on others and it's about his own comfort, it's a gray area. The friend's reaction might be overreaching, but the author's decision could still be seen as problematic. Ultimately, it's a matter of personal choice, but the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because using a woman's sexual history as a deal-breaker can perpetuate harmful judgments.\n"
