She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is a guy who refused to date a girl because she had slept with many of his teammates and he didn't want to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author mentions two main boundaries. The first is that he doesn't date people who have slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" The second is that he doesn't want to date someone who seems to target athletes, fearing it might lead to being seen as a \"ball bunny\" if he goes pro.\n\nI should think about whether these reasons are valid. Personal boundaries are important in relationships. If someone has a boundary about not dating people who have slept with their friends, that's their choice. It's subjective whether that's right or wrong. However, the second reason relates to her being interested in athletes. If the girl genuinely had a pattern of dating athletes, that's one thing, but if she just happens to be with many on the team, maybe it's not her targeting athletes but her being in a social circle where athletes are common.\n\nAlso, the mutual friend called the author sexist. That's a point to consider. If the author had the same standard regardless of gender, maybe it's not sexist. But if he's holding different standards for women than for men, that could be an issue. However, the author claims he would have the same standard if he were into guys. So maybe that's not the case here.\n\nAnother angle is consent and personal choice. The girl had the right to date who she wanted, and the author is free to set his boundaries. But some might argue that the author is making a judgment based on her past relationships, which are her choices. The question is whether his reasoning is valid or if it's an unfair judgment.\n\nAlso, the potential for drama and social issues in a pro sports context is a practical concern. If the author is worried about being mocked or dealing with insecurities, those are valid personal concerns. However, others might say that the girl's past shouldn't dictate his decision if he's willing to handle it.\n\nThere's also the issue of communication. The author didn't explain his reasons fully at first, which might have led to the girl feeling hurt. Maybe if he had communicated more clearly, the situation could have been handled better.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's often double standards in how people judge others' sexual histories. If the author were a woman with the same number of partners, would he hold her to the same standard? That's a key point. If he's applying different standards based on gender, that's problematic. The author claims he would apply the same standard if he were into men, which suggests he's not being sexist. But this is hard to verify.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author has the right to set his boundaries, but if those boundaries are based on unfair or discriminatory reasons, then he might be in the wrong. The mutual friend's criticism might be valid if the author is perpetuating stigma around women's sexual histories. However, if his reasons are about personal comfort and boundaries, it's a personal choice. The answer hinges on whether his reasons are purely personal or perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n"
