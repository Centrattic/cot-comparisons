She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was seeing a girl for two months and decided not to pursue a serious relationship because she had slept with several teammates and because he didn't want to be with someone who \"goes after athletes.\" The girl got hurt, and a mutual friend called him sexist. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning provided. The author has boundaries: not dating someone who's had relationships with friends (teammates) and not wanting to be with someone who targets athletes. He didn't want to tell the girl the real reasons but confirmed it when she guessed. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is being honest about his boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the issue is whether those boundaries are justified or if they're discriminatory. The girl's sexual history isn't directly relevant to the relationship's success, so judging her based on that could be seen as holding her to double standards. If the author had a similar history, it might be different, but since he's focusing on her actions, it could be viewed as sexist. \n\nAdditionally, the author's second reason\u2014disliking the idea of dating someone who's \"ball bunnies\"\u2014could be considered a stereotype. Assuming all women who date athletes are solely after them for status or fame is a harmful generalization. The author's refusal might stem from insecurity or societal pressures rather than the girl's actual behavior. \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction as \"sexist\" might not be baseless here. If the author had similar histories or if his judgment was based on her choices alone without considering her autonomy, then he might be in the wrong. However, if he's simply stating his boundaries without forcing them on her, there's a case for him not being in the wrong. \n\nBut the key point is whether his reasons are valid. While everyone has the right to set boundaries, if those boundaries are based on prejudiced views or unrealistic expectations, then they might not be acceptable. The author's refusal isn't about her character but about her past actions, which some might see as invalid. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to his preferences, the way he's framing his reasons could be seen as judgmental and sexist. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
