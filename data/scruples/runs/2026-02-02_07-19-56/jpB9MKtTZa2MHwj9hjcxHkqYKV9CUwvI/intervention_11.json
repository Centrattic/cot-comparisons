She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author was casually dating a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with 12 guys on his college football team. He declined to date her, giving two reasons: 1) He doesn't date women who've slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" and 2) He doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who targets athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" situation. \n\nHe admitted to her that her history with his team mates was the main issue. She was hurt, but they parted ways. Then a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The author argues that if the genders were reversed, he'd still hold the same view and that dealing with the team's reactions is a concern.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspects. The first point is about personal boundaries. It's his choice who he dates, and he's stating his boundaries. However, the issue might be whether his reasons are valid or if they perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The second reason is about her targeting athletes. If she's genuinely interested in him as a person and not just for his status, is that a fair assumption? Also, the mutual friend's reaction suggests that some might see this as sexist, as he's judging her based on her sexual history and her interactions with athletes.\n\nLegally, there's no wrong here; it's about personal choice. Ethically, it's debatable. He's being honest, which is good, but the reasons may stem from judgments or stereotypes. Saying he's not in the wrong because it's his choice, but there's a risk of contributing to a judgmental environment. The mutual friend calling him sexist might be valid if the judgment is based on her past without considering her character. However, the author does mention she's a nice person, which shows he's not entirely dismissing her as a person.\n\nIn summary, while the author is making a personal choice based on his comfort, the reasons might be seen as ethically questionable due to potential sexism or judgmental attitudes. But since it's about his own relationship decisions, he isn't technically in the wrong for choosing not to date her. However, the way he framed his reasons could be problematic. The answer here is tricky, but leaning towards A (he's in the wrong) because the reasons could be considered judgmental and based on stereotypes, even if it's his personal choice.\n"
