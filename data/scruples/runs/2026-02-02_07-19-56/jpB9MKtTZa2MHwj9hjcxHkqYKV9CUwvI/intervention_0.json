She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author ending a casual relationship with a girl because she slept with teammates and he doesn't want to date someone who \"goes after athletes.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a boundary not to date someone who's slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" Also, he doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" scenario. When the girl asked to date, he said no, and admitted it was because of her sexual history with the team. A mutual friend called him sexist, which he denies, saying he'd have the same reaction if roles were reversed. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're curious about my take. I need to evaluate based on societal norms, respect, and fairness. While personal boundaries are valid, making decisions based on someone's sexual history can be problematic. It's a form of judgment, and in some contexts, it could be seen as hypocritical, especially if the author isn't applying the same standards to himself. Also, the mutual friend's reaction as sexist might have merit if the author's criteria are based on gender stereotypes. However, the author argues that it's about avoiding drama and potential insecurity, which are personal reasons. The mutual friend's accusation of sexism might not hold if the author is applying the same logic to other scenarios, but there's a risk of bias here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's autonomy and not making assumptions based on their past is important. The author might be making a judgment that could be seen as controlling or prejudiced. However, people do have the right to set personal boundaries in relationships. The line is thin between valid boundaries and being discriminatory. The author's reasoning might be justifiable in his own mind, but others might see it as unfair. Considering all this, there's a case to be made for the author being in the wrong due to judgment based on sexual history and potential sexism, but also a case for personal choice. The mutual friend's anger suggests others see it as wrong. So, leaning towards A (in the wrong) but need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
