She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who was dating a girl for two months but decided not to take it seriously because she slept with 12 guys on his football team. He gave two main reasons: he doesn't date women who slept with his friends to avoid drama, and he doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who targets athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The guy's reasons are based on his personal boundaries, which he's had for a long time. He did break up with her, but the mutual friend is upset and called him a sexist. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nLet me break down his reasoning. He compares it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" meaning he doesn't want to mix casual relationships with people he's close with. That's a common boundary, but is it fair? If the girl was sleeping with his teammates, maybe she's in a different social circle. But if he's friends with them, there's potential for overlapping social interactions. However, he's making a judgment based on her past actions, not her current behavior or feelings towards him. \n\nSecond, his fear of dating someone who targets athletes. That could be a stereotype. Just because she's been with multiple athletes doesn't mean she's solely after them for their status. It's possible she's just someone with a high libido or active social life. His reasoning here might be based on assumptions rather than her actual intentions. \n\nHe didn't want to tell her the real reasons at first but admitted it when pressed. That might have been a bit abrupt and could have been handled more sensitively. However, he did express that he thought she was cool and it was a mismatch in values. \n\nThe mutual friend's anger suggests that others might view his actions as sexist, possibly because he's judging her based on her past partners. But the user points out that if the genders were reversed, he'd have the same stance, implying it's not about sexism but personal boundaries. Still, some might argue that judging someone's worth based on their sexual history is unfair, especially if the person is being honest and it's in the past.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to set their own boundaries in relationships. If he's clear about his values and acts on them, that's his choice. However, if his reasons are based on stereotypes or could be seen as discriminatory, there's a case against him. But given that he stated he wouldn't hold it against a guy if roles were reversed, it might not be sexist. \n\nThe key here is whether his reasons are legitimate personal boundaries or if they unfairly judge the woman. Since he's honest about his boundaries and it's about his comfort in a relationship, it's a matter of personal choice. However, others might argue that it's unfair to dismiss someone solely based on their past sexual behavior. \n\nIn summary, while the author has the right to his own boundaries, the judgment might be seen as unfair by others. But since he's not causing harm beyond ending the relationship, the ethical stance is debatable. The answer hinges on whether personal boundaries are considered valid in this context.\n"
