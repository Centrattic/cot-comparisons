She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating the girl because of her sexual history with his teammates. The author provided two main reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and not wanting to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. Everyone has their own deal-breakers in relationships. The first reason is about personal comfort. The author is stating that they don't want drama from past relationships with friends. It's their choice to set that boundary. But is it fair to the girl? Maybe not, because it's based on her past actions that don't directly affect their relationship now. However, it's their right to have such boundaries.\n\nThe second reason is about her being a \"ball bunny,\" which is a term that can carry negative connotations. The author is concerned about dating someone who's interested in athletes for the wrong reasons. However, the girl's past actions might not reflect her intentions towards the author. She could genuinely like him, but he's making assumptions based on her history. That could be problematic because it's a stereotype.\n\nThe mutual friend called the author sexist, which the author disagrees with. The author argues that if the roles were reversed, they would still have the same stance. But maybe that's not the case. If the author were a woman and the girl was dating someone from her team, would he react the same way? It's possible the author is projecting his own biases here. Also, using someone's sexual history as a reason to not pursue a relationship can be seen as judgmental or discriminatory, regardless of the person's gender.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, the author isn't breaking any laws. However, in terms of social morality, it's more nuanced. The author is making a personal choice based on their values, but it's important to consider if they're respecting the girl's autonomy and not making assumptions. Also, the author's refusal led to the girl feeling hurt, which is a valid emotional response. The friend's anger might stem from seeing it as sexist, but the author might see it as a personal preference.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't legally wrong, morally, they might be seen as disrespectful or discriminatory. The key points are the judgment based on past sexual partners and the potential for biased assumptions. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if personal boundaries are respected, then B (not wrong). But since the author is making assumptions about her intentions based on stereotypes, maybe A is the right choice.\n"
