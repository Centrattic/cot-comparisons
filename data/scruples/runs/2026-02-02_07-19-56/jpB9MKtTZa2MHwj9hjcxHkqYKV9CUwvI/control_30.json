She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who broke off a potential relationship with a girl because she had slept with several of his teammates and he felt she was targeting athletes. The key points here are his reasons for not pursuing the relationship and the reactions from others.\n\nFirst, let's look at the reasons he gave. He mentioned two main boundaries: not dating someone who's slept with his friends and not dating someone who targets athletes. These are personal boundaries, which he's entitled to have. However, there's a nuance here. The first reason is about sleeping with his friends, which he compares to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's about avoiding drama, which makes sense. People have different comfort levels regarding their partner's past relationships with their friends.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who's \"ball bunnies,\" which is a term that often carries negative connotations and can be seen as sexist. The user mentions that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who's after his financial success as a potential pro athlete. This could be viewed as a personal choice, but the way he frames it might come off as judgmental towards women who are sexually active or who are interested in athletes. The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which suggests that others see this as a problematic attitude.\n\nHe also argues that if the girl were a guy and he were into guys, he'd have the same stance. However, that comparison might not hold because societal norms and stigma around male and female sexuality often differ. The idea that a woman's sexual history should affect whether someone dates her can be seen as unfair, especially in a modern context where people are increasingly accepting of partner's pasts.\n\nThe girl was hurt when he revealed his reason, which indicates that his decision caused emotional pain. While he might not be wrong in choosing to set boundaries, the way he handled the situation and the underlying attitudes could be problematic. The mutual friend's reaction also brings into question whether his reasoning is perceived as sexist, even if he doesn't see it that way.\n\nIn terms of societal standards, while personal boundaries are valid, basing a decision solely on someone's sexual history can be discriminatory. The question is whether his reasons are just personal preferences or if they cross into prejudice. Since he's not wrong for having boundaries, but the way he expressed them and the mutual friend's reaction suggest there's a chance his reasons are seen as sexist, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the core issue is whether it's fair to judge someone's worth in a relationship based on their past, which many would argue is not fair. So, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong, but there's a counterargument for personal choice. The mutual friend's reaction and the potential for his reasoning to be sexist tips it towards him being in the wrong.\n"
