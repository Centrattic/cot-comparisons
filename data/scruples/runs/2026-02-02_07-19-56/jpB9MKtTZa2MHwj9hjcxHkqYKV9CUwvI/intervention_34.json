She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not pursuing a relationship with a girl because she had slept with multiple guys on his college football team and because he doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions two main reasons: 1) not dating someone who has slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\"), and 2) not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes, fearing it could affect his potential pro career. The girl in question was a nice person but had a history with the team. The author admitted it was because of her sleeping with the team members when she asked directly. The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, and he argues that if he were gay and the roles were reversed, he'd still make the same choice.\n\nNow, to evaluate if he's in the wrong. The first point about boundaries is personal. It's his choice to set that boundary, but is it fair? Some might say he's being hypocritical or judgmental if he's only applying this to women. The second reason is about her targeting athletes. That's more about his personal preferences and future goals. However, labeling someone as a \"ball bunny\" could be seen as sexist or reductive. Also, his reasoning might come off as double standards if he's not applying similar standards in other contexts. The mutual friend's reaction suggests that others might view his decision as discriminatory, especially if it's based on her relationships rather than her character. The author's defense about not being a double standard if the genders were reversed might not hold if the issue is about his own comfort and not her actions. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's his choice to date whom he wants, but the way he framed his reasons could be problematic. The question is whether it's wrong to have those boundaries. If he's being honest and not acting out of malice, maybe not. However, if the reasons are based on stereotypes or unfair judgments, then he could be in the wrong. The girl was upfront, and he chose not to date her, which is his right, but the way he communicated it without considering her feelings might be an issue. The mutual friend's anger could indicate that the community sees this as unfair. \n\nI need to weigh personal choice versus potential judgmental attitudes. The author is making a personal choice based on his comfort, but if it's based on her sexual history in a way that's discriminatory, that's where the line might be crossed. The mutual friend's reaction points to possible sexism. Also, the author's justification about not dealing with chirps or insecurities might be a personal reason, but it's not necessarily wrong to avoid potential drama. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer leans towards A (yes), it's because his reasons might be based on stereotypes or unfair judgments. If B (no), then it's about personal choice and boundaries. The key is whether his reasons are valid or biased. The mutual friend's callout suggests that some see it as sexist, but the author defends his stance. It's a nuanced situation where personal boundaries are involved. The answer might depend on cultural or societal views on sexual history and dating choices. In many modern contexts, judging someone's past relationships, especially if they're not abusive or harmful, could be seen as problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for having those biases. So, A.\n"
