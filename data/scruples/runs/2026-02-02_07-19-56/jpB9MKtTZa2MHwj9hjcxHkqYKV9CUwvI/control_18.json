She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating the girl because of her sexual history and her relationships with his teammates.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The author was seeing a girl for two months, but she had slept with many of his teammates. He decided not to date her because of two main reasons: 1) he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends, and 2) he's against dating someone who targets athletes, fearing it could affect his pro prospects and being a \"ball bunny.\"\n\nThe question is about whether he's at fault. So, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. \n\nFrom a personal boundaries perspective, the author is making a choice based on his own comfort. It's his right to set boundaries in relationships. If he feels that dating someone with a history with his friends would lead to drama, that's his personal preference. Similarly, not wanting to date someone who's into athletes because of his future goals is also a valid concern. \n\nHowever, the other side is about judgment and potential sexism. The girl's response and the mutual friend's reaction suggest that some people see this as unfair or sexist. If the author had the same standards regardless of gender, then it's about personal choice. But if he's applying double standards (e.g., being okay if he dated someone who targets athletes but not if it's the other way around), that could be problematic. The author mentions that if the situation were reversed (he was into guys and she was a guy who slept with his teammates), his answer would be the same. That suggests he's applying consistent standards, which might mitigate the sexism claim.\n\nThe mutual friend's anger and calling him a sexist asshole is another angle. It's possible that the friend perceives the author's reasoning as discriminatory, especially if the girl's behavior isn't affecting their relationship beyond the author's personal preferences. \n\nLegally and ethically, unless there's a law against it, personal preferences in relationships are generally acceptable. However, societal norms and cultural expectations might view this as judgmental or hypocritical. The key is whether the author is respecting the girl's autonomy and the mutual friend's perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on his own boundaries and fears. As long as he's being honest and not discriminating based on protected characteristics, he might not be in the wrong. But if the mutual friend's accusation of sexism is valid due to implicit biases, then there's a case for him being wrong. The author's own statement about consistency (same response if the genders were reversed) supports that he's not sexist, but others might still see it as judgmental regardless. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author is applying his standards consistently and without prejudice. Since he states he would act the same regardless of gender, and it's about personal choice, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
