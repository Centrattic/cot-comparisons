She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they were seeing a girl for two months, and she slept with 12 guys on their football team. When she asked to start dating, he said no because of his personal boundaries. His reasons were not wanting to date someone who's slept with his friends (using the \"don't shit where you eat\" analogy) and not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes because he might go pro.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his reasons are valid. Personal boundaries are important. People have different standards for relationships, and if someone's boundaries are clear to them, they have the right to set those. However, the question is whether his reasoning is problematic from a moral standpoint. \n\nThe first reason is about not dating someone who's slept with friends. That seems like a personal choice. It's similar to not wanting to date someone who's slept with a close friend, which some people might find uncomfortable. But is that a fair reason? Well, it's his choice, but some might call it judgmental. The analogy he uses is \"don't shit where you eat,\" implying that sleeping with friends is like defecating where you eat. That's a strong metaphor and might be seen as a bit harsh, but again, it's his boundary.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who targets athletes. He mentions that dating a \"ball bunny\" is his worst nightmare. This could be seen as sexist because it's a stereotype that some women are only interested in athletes for their status or money. However, he argues that if the situation were reversed and he were into guys, his reasoning would be the same. But does that hold up? If he were a woman dating a man who slept with his friends, would he have the same issue? The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which suggests that others see the reasoning as biased. \n\nHe also mentions that dating someone with a reputation could lead to being mocked or insecurities. That's a personal concern, but it's also about his own comfort and potential for drama. However, the girl didn't ask to be in a relationship where sleeping with teammates is off-limits. He didn't communicate his boundaries before, so the issue might be about honesty and communication rather than the reasons themselves. \n\nSo is he in the wrong? He's not legally wrong, but morally? If his reasons are based on stereotypes or double standards, then he might be. The key is whether his reasoning is fair and respectful. If he's applying the same standards regardless of gender, maybe not. But if he's applying different standards, then yes. He claims he'd have the same reaction regardless of gender, but the mutual friend disagrees. There's also the aspect of not being open to different perspectives. \n\nIn conclusion, while he has the right to his own boundaries, the way he's framing his reasons might perpetuate stereotypes. So the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because his reasoning could be seen as sexist and judgmental, even if he's honest about his boundaries.\n"
