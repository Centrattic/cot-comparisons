She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe main issue here is that the guy ended a potential relationship because the girl had slept with 12 guys on his college football team. His two reasons are: 1) He doesn't date girls who have slept with his friends (comparing it to not shit where you eat), and 2) He doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes, fearing it might affect his pro chances.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the validity of his reasons. The first reason is about personal boundaries. He's setting a personal limit, which is his right. However, the comparison to \"don't shit where you eat\" might be a bit harsh. The girl's sexual history doesn't directly affect him in terms of eating, but it's a metaphor for avoiding drama. But is it fair to judge someone's past based on their previous partners? That's subjective. Some people might see it as a personal choice, while others might think it's judgmental.\n\nThe second reason is about her being a \"ball bunny,\" which could imply he thinks she's only interested in athletes for their status or future success. If that's her pattern, maybe he's right to be cautious. But if she genuinely liked him as a person, maybe it's unfair to dismiss her based on past actions. Also, the term \"ball bunny\" is derogatory and might carry sexist undertones, which the mutual friend pointed out.\n\nHe didn't want to explain his reasoning at first, but when asked, he confirmed it was because of her sexual history with his teammates. The girl was hurt, which is understandable. Ending a relationship over someone's past sexual partners can be seen as hypocritical or bigoted, especially if the person is otherwise compatible. However, if this is a personal boundary he's always had, it's his choice, but he needs to take responsibility for how his actions affected her.\n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist, which raises the question of double standards. If he had similar past relationships, would he hold a male partner to the same standard? If not, that could be sexist. But if he's applying the same standard to both genders, maybe not. However, the term \"ball bunny\" is a gendered term, which might contribute to the perception of sexism.\n\nIn terms of consent and autonomy, the girl's sexual history is her business. He's allowed to have personal preferences, but judging someone's worth based on their past partners can be problematic. The key is whether his boundaries are reasonable and whether he communicated them respectfully. He did end things amicably, acknowledging her as a cool person, which shows he didn't devalue her, just didn't feel it was a match.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's making a personal choice based on his values, which he's entitled to. However, the way he framed his reasons, especially using terms like \"ball bunny,\" might come off as judgmental or sexist. His friend's reaction might not be entirely unfounded if he's applying different standards based on gender. But if he's being honest about his own boundaries without malice, he's not necessarily in the wrong. It's about personal values versus others' perceptions. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether the judgment is based on her actions (which is okay) versus her inherent worth (which isn't). Since he's choosing not to date her based on his own criteria, and not pressuring her, he's probably not in the wrong. But the mutual friend's reaction highlights potential issues with his reasoning's fairness.\n"
