She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The main points are that the author declined to date the girl because she had slept with multiple guys on the football team and he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes. \n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries and whether they're reasonable. The author mentions that he has a boundary against dating someone who's slept with his friends, comparing it to the \"don't shit where you eat\" principle. That makes sense to some extent because relationships already have enough drama without adding friends into the mix. However, people's sexual histories are their own, and choosing a partner based on that could be seen as judgmental.\n\nNext, the second point is about not wanting to date someone who targets athletes. The author is concerned about being labeled as a \"ball bunny\" and the potential for jealousy or public embarrassment. But is it fair to judge someone based on their past relationships, especially if they're not currently in a relationship with any of them? The girl might not be in a relationship with those guys now, so their past interactions shouldn't necessarily affect the current relationship. \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction is also a point. The friend called the author sexist, which might stem from the idea that the author is making a decision based on the girl's sexual history rather than her character. However, the author argues that if the situation were reversed, he would have made the same choice, so it's not about gender. But the fact that he's making a decision based on her past actions could still be seen as biased, even if not overtly sexist.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. In many societies, there's a double standard regarding sexual history, where men are often given more leeway than women. If the author had been a woman making similar choices, would the judgment have been the same? That's a factor here. The author's reasoning might be influenced by traditional views that equate a woman's value with her sexual history, which is problematic.\n\nAdditionally, communication is key in relationships. The author chose not to explain his reasons in detail, which led to the girl feeling hurt. Being honest is good, but maybe there's a way to communicate boundaries without causing hurt. However, he did explain that it was a mismatch of boundaries, which is a valid reason for parting ways.\n\nThe author's concern about public perception and potential jokes is also valid. He wants to avoid unnecessary drama, which is a personal choice. But is that a valid reason to reject someone? It depends on whether the drama stems from the girl's actions or societal judgment. The author is prioritizing his comfort over the relationship, which is his right, but it might not make him \"in the wrong\" if he's being honest about his boundaries.\n\nPutting it all together, the author is making a decision based on personal boundaries that he's clear about. However, the judgment of someone else's sexual history could be seen as unfair, especially if there's no current relationship or ongoing issues. The mutual friend's accusation of sexism might be overreacting, but the author's reasoning does touch on outdated notions of purity and reputation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. If the girl's actions don't affect the current relationship's viability, then the author is making a choice based on personal preferences rather than objective harm. However, if the author is applying a standard that's not reciprocal or is based on outdated norms, then there's a case to be made that he's in the wrong. But if he's being honest about his boundaries and not causing harm, he's not necessarily in the wrong. I think the key is whether his reasons are respectful and based on mutual respect. Since he's being upfront and it's a matter of personal preference, he might not be in the wrong. But if society's judgment is influencing him unfairly, then maybe he is. Hmm.\n"
