She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy was seeing a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with 12 guys from his football team, and she's been going after athletes. He decided not to date her because of her sexual history and his own boundaries. He told her the reason was about sleeping with his teammates, which made her hurt. Then a mutual friend got angry, calling him sexist. He argues that if roles were reversed, he'd have the same opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal boundaries and whether his reasons are valid. He says he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's a personal boundary, so it's his choice. But does that make him in the wrong? Well, he's honest about his reasons, even if they might be based on personal preferences or maybe some insecurities. \n\nHe also mentions not wanting to date someone who's dating athletes, which he calls a \"ball bunny.\" That might come off as sexist because he's generalizing about women who sleep with athletes. But he claims he'd have the same issue if the genders were reversed. Still, the perception is that he's making a judgment based on her sexual history, which can be a touchy subject. \n\nThe mutual friend accused him of being sexist. If his reasoning is based on her past partners rather than her character, that could be seen as unfair. But he's entitled to his boundaries. The question is whether those boundaries are valid or if they're discriminatory. Some might argue that judging someone's past relationships is personal, but others might see it as hypocritical or sexist, especially in a society where such judgments can be prejudiced against women.\n\nAlso, he was honest and didn't lie. He tried to be kind, explaining it's a mismatch in boundaries. She was hurt, but he didn't force the relationship. So from a moral standpoint, it's debatable. He's not forcing her; he's making a choice based on his own comfort. However, if society or his friend's perspective is that his reasons are unfair, he might be seen as in the wrong. \n\nBut ultimately, it's about personal choice. He's not harming her by not dating her. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But there's a nuance because his reasons could be seen as sexist, even if he doesn't intend them to be. The mutual friend's reaction might be valid if he's projecting his own biases. However, the guy isn't forced to date her just because of her past. So the answer might be B, but with some caveats.\n"
