She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong, given their situation. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author was casually dating a girl for two months. She had slept with 12 guys from his college football team. When she asked to start a real relationship, he declined. His reasons were: 1) He doesn't date girls who slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\"), and 2) He doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes, fearing a \"ball bunny\" relationship. After he said no, she figured out the reason, they parted ways, and a mutual friend called him sexist and an asshole. The author is confused because he thinks if he was into guys and this was a guy, his answer would be the same. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is making a judgment based on the girl's sexual history and her associations. The first reason is about not dating someone who has slept with his friends. That seems like a personal boundary. It's his choice, but some might argue that the number of people she's slept with isn't his to judge. The second reason is about not wanting to date someone who targets athletes. That could be seen as a personal preference, but there's a potential for prejudice here. He's making an assumption about her based on her past actions, which could imply that he sees her as a \"ball bunny\" rather than an individual. \n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist. Is that fair? If he's applying the same standard regardless of gender, maybe not. But if the issue is about her behavior towards athletes, perhaps there's a double standard. For example, if he was a woman and she was a man who had relationships with athletes, would he still have the same issue? That could be a point of contention. He claims he would have the same issue, but some might argue that his reasoning is rooted in stereotypes about women's behavior rather than actual behavior.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to set their own boundaries in relationships. However, making a judgment based on past sexual partners can be seen as discriminatory. In many societies, it's considered hypocritical if someone judges others for having a high number of sexual partners when they themselves might not adhere to the same standard. Also, the term \"ball bunny\" is derogatory and implies that the woman is only interested in athletes for their status or money, which is a stereotype.\n\nAnother angle: Was the author honest? He initially didn't tell her the real reasons but later admitted when she asked. Honesty in relationships is important, but in a casual context, maybe it's different. However, he did clarify that it was about boundaries, which is a valid reason.\n\nThe friend calling him a sexist asshole might be overreacting, but there's merit in pointing out that society often judges women more harshly for their sexual history than men. If the author is applying the same standard to a man, that's different, but if he's only applying it to a woman, it's sexist. However, the author says he would apply the same standard if the genders were reversed, which complicates it. But that might not hold up in practice, as societal norms often influence such judgments.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stating his boundaries and personal preferences. However, the way he framed his reasoning might perpetuate stereotypes or double standards. The key here is whether his reasons are his own choice or if they're discriminatory. If it's just his personal preference, then he's not in the wrong. But if others perceive it as discriminatory, that's a different matter.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author is explaining his reasons as personal boundaries and preferences, and not forcing his views on her, he's not in the wrong per se. However, the mutual friend's accusation of sexism might have some validity because of societal biases. But from a strict standpoint of personal choice and right to set boundaries, the answer could be B (No, not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the reasoning is flawed and thus he is in the wrong. But in the context of the question, which is about whether he is \"in the wrong,\" the answer depends on whether his actions were offensive or not. Since he's not doing anything illegal or violating her rights, it's a personal choice. So, the answer might be B.\n"
