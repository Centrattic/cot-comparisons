She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he was casually dating a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with a lot of guys on his college football team. He didn't want to date her because of that, citing two reasons: he doesn't date girls who slept with his friends, and he doesn't date girls who go after athletes. Then he told her he wasn't interested, which made her hurt. A mutual friend called him sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his reasons. The first boundary he mentions is about not dating someone who's slept with his friends. That seems like a personal boundary. But is that fair? It sounds like a double standard if he's okay with sleeping with her but not dating her. Also, judging someone by their past relationships or sexual history can be problematic, especially if it's not affecting the current relationship. He says it's like \"don't shit where you eat,\" avoiding drama. But maybe the drama comes from his own assumptions, not her actions. If she had slept with his friends before he even met her, then it's her past, and maybe not a valid reason to end things now.\n\nThe second reason is not wanting to date someone who targets athletes. He mentions she went after athletes, which he wants to avoid. But if she had already been with many guys on the team before their casual relationship, maybe she's not targeting him specifically, just the group. He might be projecting his own insecurities about being an athlete and not wanting to be in a relationship where others have been involved. But again, if he's comfortable with casual relationships but not serious ones, maybe that's more about his own issues than her actions.\n\nHe also said that if he was into guys and this girl was a guy he was sleeping with, his answer would be the same. But that's a bit different because the context changes. If he's applying the same standard regardless of gender, it's about mutual respect. However, if he's using her past relationships as a reason to not date her, he's making a judgment based on her history, which isn't his business. Everyone has different sexual histories, and it's not fair to judge someone for that unless it's affecting the current relationship.\n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist. That could be because he's rejecting her based on her sexuality, which might be seen as discriminatory. But it's also about personal preferences. However, if he's not holding the same standard for himself or other people, then it's a double standard. If he's okay with his own past but not hers, that's a problem. But if he's honest about his boundaries, maybe it's his right to set them.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's about consent and respect. If she was okay with his boundaries and they were mutual, then it's his choice. But if he's using her past to avoid commitment or deal with his own insecurities, maybe he's not being fair. Also, by not giving her a chance to explain or address his concerns, he might be making an unfair assumption. The fact that he was okay with a casual relationship but not a serious one suggests that his issue might be more about the transition to dating rather than her actions directly.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person might be in the wrong if his reasons are based on judgment rather than mutual respect. But if he's clear about his boundaries from the start, it's his choice. However, the way he's phrasing it might be seen as sexist because he's basing his decision on her sexual history, which isn't his place to judge. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's making a judgment based on her past and projecting his own issues onto her.\n"
