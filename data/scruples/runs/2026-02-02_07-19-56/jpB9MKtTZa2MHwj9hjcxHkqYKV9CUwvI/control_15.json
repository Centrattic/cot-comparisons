She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he was seeing a girl for two months and then decided not to date her because she had slept with several guys on his football team. He gives two reasons: 1) He doesn't date people who've been with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\" to avoid drama. 2) He doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes because he might go pro and doesn't want a \"ball bunny\" situation. Then, when he told her, she got hurt, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Personal boundaries are important. He set his boundaries and acted on them. But does that make him wrong? Well, he's being honest about his preferences. However, the reasons might be problematic. The first reason is about not wanting drama from friends sleeping with his partner. That's a common concern, and people often have boundaries about their partner's relationships with their friends. The second reason is about her being a \"ball bunny.\" That term can carry a negative connotation and might be a stereotype. It's possible he's generalizing her behavior based on that label rather than her actual character.\n\nHe didn't disclose all his reasons at first, only confirming her assumption. Maybe he should have been more specific. But he did say he thought she was a cool person. The mutual friend's reaction suggests that some people see this as sexist. The argument is that if he were a woman and she was into guys who were his friends, would it be the same? But the author argues that if the genders were reversed, he'd still make the same choice. That's a point about consistency, but societal expectations might differ here.\n\nIs it fair to judge someone's sexual history? That's a big topic. Some people prioritize monogamy and might not want their partner to have had many partners, especially within their own circle. Others might see it as a personal choice. The author is choosing based on his own comfort, which is his right, but it can be seen as judgmental.\n\nThe mutual friend's anger points to possible sexism. The term \"ball bunny\" is often used derogatorily towards women who are perceived as pursuing athletes for status. If the author is applying this label without considering her actual intentions, it could be unfair. Maybe the girl's actions were consensual and not about being a \"ball bunny,\" but the author's perception is based on stereotypes.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's acting on his own boundaries and being honest, he's not necessarily wrong. But if his reasoning is rooted in stereotypes or double standards, then maybe he is. Since he admitted he didn't want to date someone he perceives as a \"ball bunny,\" which is a judgment based on her past actions, it could be seen as sexist or hypocritical, especially if similar behavior from a man wouldn't be an issue. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just whether his reasoning is flawed. If his actions were respectful and he communicated clearly, maybe not. But if his reasoning is discriminatory, then he might be. The answer might depend on societal norms and personal ethics. Since the options are A or B, I need to decide based on the analysis. The key points are his boundary of not dating someone who's slept with his friends and his aversion to \"ball bunnies.\" If those are his genuine reasons, he's not wrong to act on them, but others might criticize the reasoning. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A due to sexism. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given he's being honest and setting his own boundaries, maybe B is correct.\n"
