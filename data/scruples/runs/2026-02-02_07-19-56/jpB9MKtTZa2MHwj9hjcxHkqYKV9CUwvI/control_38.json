She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that he was seeing a girl for two months and decided not to date her because she had slept with 12 guys from his college football team. He gave two main reasons: he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and he doesn't date girls who are after athletes, fearing being a \"ball bunny.\" When he said no, she got hurt, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to evaluate if his reasons are valid. Personal boundaries are important. If someone has a strict boundary about not dating people who sleep with their friends, even if that's others, then it's their choice. But is it fair to apply that boundary when the person in question isn't sleeping with his friends directly but others on his team? Wait, the girl slept with guys on his team, which are his friends. So his reasoning is that he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends. That's a personal choice, but maybe others might see it as hypocritical if he's part of a football team where such relationships are common. \n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who's into athletes. That's a bit different. If the girl is only interested in athletes, maybe he's right to avoid that. But if she's just someone who's had relationships with athletes, is that a valid reason? It depends on his personal preferences. If he's worried about being called a \"ball bunny\" or dealing with teasing, that's his own insecurities, perhaps. \n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist. Is that fair? If he had the same standard for any partner, like not dating someone who slept with his friends, but here it's specific because she's a girl and he's a guy? The question mentions that if the roles were reversed (he was into guys and she was sleeping with his friends), he'd have the same stance. So he's not against the behavior itself, just the gender aspect. But in this case, the girl slept with his friends, which is what he's objecting to. \n\nSo, is he being sexist? Maybe. If the issue is that she's had multiple partners but the problem is specifically because they're his teammates, then it's about his own boundaries. However, using the fact that she's slept with his friends as a reason not to date her could be seen as holding onto a double standard if he's in a culture where such relationships are common. Also, if he's not willing to date someone because of their past, even if they're not currently involved with the team members, it's a personal choice but might be judged as shallow or unfair. \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction might be based on the idea that it's wrong to judge someone's past sexual history. However, the author's reasoning is about his own boundaries and potential discomfort, not about judging her for being promiscuous. But in some perspectives, it's valid for him to set those boundaries. However, others might argue that it's unfair to hold someone's past against them, especially if they're not currently in a relationship with his friends. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he's honest about his boundaries and isn't discriminating beyond his personal preferences, then technically not in the wrong. But if society judges him for having such standards, then people might side against him. The mutual friend called him sexist, but if the author's reasoning is about his own boundaries (not hers being promiscuous but about his team), maybe the friend is wrong. However, if the problem is that he's avoiding potential judgment from others (like teammates roasting him) rather than personal boundaries, that's more about his insecurities. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might depend on whether personal boundaries are considered valid. Since the author is honest and the girl understood it's a mismatch in boundaries, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he's being judgmental. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because he's setting his own boundaries, even if others disagree.\n"
