She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who's not dating a girl because she has slept with multiple guys on his college football team and he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the reasons given. The first reason is that he doesn't date girls who have slept with his friends. He compares it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" which is about avoiding unnecessary drama. The second reason is his aversion to dating someone who seems to target athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" situation and doesn't want that dynamic in a relationship.\n\nHe didn't want to tell her the real reason initially but confirmed her suspicion when she asked. She was hurt, and a mutual friend called him sexist. He argues that if the roles were reversed, he'd still make the same decision, so it's not about sexism. He also mentions possible roasting from others and his own insecurities.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Relationships involve personal boundaries, and people have different standards. If he's clear about his boundaries, it's not necessarily wrong to act on them. However, if his reasons are based on discriminatory beliefs (like judging a woman's worth based on her sexual history), that could be problematic. But he says he's not judging her as a person; he just doesn't want the drama or the type of relationship. \n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist, which is a claim he disputes. If his reasoning is based on her behavior (sleeping with teammates) rather than her gender, then it's not sexist. Deciding not to date someone based on their actions is a personal choice. However, if society's expectations influence his decision in a way that's unfair, that's a different story. But he's being honest with himself about his reasons.\n\nThe key here is whether his reasons are valid in the context of personal choice. People can have different deal-breakers, and as long as he's not violating any laws or ethical codes, it's his decision. The fact that he was upfront about his boundaries even when it hurt her feelings might be seen as mature. However, some might argue that his stance is judgmental, but that's subjective.\n\nIn conclusion, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's making a choice based on his own values and boundaries, as long as it's not discriminatory. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
