She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author was casually dating a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with at least 12 guys from his college football team. He declined to take things seriously for two reasons: 1) not wanting to date someone who's slept with his friends, and 2) not wanting to date someone who targets athletes. The girl asked if the reason was about the number of partners, and he confirmed it. Then a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The author is defending himself by saying he wouldn't care if the genders were reversed and that he wants to avoid drama and jokes.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether his reasons are valid. The first reason is about boundaries. He doesn't want to date someone who's intimate with his friends. That's a personal boundary, which is okay. People have different boundaries, and it's their right to set them. However, in modern contexts, some might see this as a double standard, especially if he's okay with his own sexual history but not hers. But the key here is that he's consistent with his own boundaries, not making a judgment about hers, just stating what he's comfortable with.\n\nThe second reason is about her targeting athletes. He's concerned about being in a relationship with someone who's primarily interested in athletes. This could be a valid concern if he's worried about her motives. But if she's genuinely interested in him as a person rather than just his status as an athlete, that's a different matter. However, he's making a judgment based on her past behavior, which might not fully reflect her current intentions. Still, it's part of his decision-making process.\n\nThe girl was hurt, which is understandable. She might feel that her past shouldn't be a dealbreaker. But the author is clear that it's about their boundaries not matching. The mutual friend called him sexist, implying that his reasons are discriminatory. However, if the author's boundaries apply equally regardless of gender (as stated), then it's more about personal preference rather than sexism. For example, if he had the same issue if her gender were different, it's not sexist.\n\nI should consider societal norms and expectations. Some people might view judging a partner based on their past relationships as outdated or unfair. Others might see it as a personal choice. The author's reasoning is based on his own comfort and potential future (going pro), which adds another layer. He's thinking of his career and avoiding situations that could lead to jealousy or public scrutiny.\n\nThe main question is whether his reasons are valid enough to not be considered in the wrong. Since he's honest about his boundaries and isn't making a value judgment on her past, just stating that it doesn't align with what he wants, it's more about mutual compatibility. The girl was given a clear reason, and they parted ways amicably. The mutual friend's anger might stem from a different perspective, but the author isn't obligated to agree with everyone's opinions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting personal boundaries and being honest about what he's comfortable with in a relationship. It's a matter of personal choice and values, not necessarily wrongdoing. So the answer should be B.\n"
