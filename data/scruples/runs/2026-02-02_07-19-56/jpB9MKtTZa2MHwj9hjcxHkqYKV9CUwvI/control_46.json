She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy refusing to date a girl because she's slept with a lot of guys from his college football team. He gives two reasons: one about not dating people who've slept with his friends, and two, about not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy feels that his boundaries are important. He's drawing a line at sleeping with someone who's had relationships with his teammates. His reasoning is about avoiding drama and personal discomfort. On the other hand, the girl might feel that his reasons are judgmental and based on her past actions rather than who she is now. The mutual friend who called him a sexist asshole probably thinks he's making a value judgment on her sexuality.\n\nNow, societal norms. There's a lot of discussion about how people shouldn't judge others for their sexual history. The guy's stance could be seen as hypocritical or sexist if he's applying different standards to a woman than he would to a man. For example, if the girl had said he slept with a lot of girls, would he feel the same way? The post mentions that he thinks he'd act the same if the genders were reversed, but it's hard to say if that's true without evidence.\n\nAlso, the idea of \"ball bunnies\" and the fear of being a pro athlete's partner might be more about his personal insecurities than the girl's actions. The girl's behavior might be part of her social circle, not necessarily a reflection of her character. The guy is prioritizing his own comfort over her feelings, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nBut then, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries for relationships. If this is something he's always felt strongly about, he's not wrong for having those standards. However, the way he handled it\u2014being evasive but then confirming her suspicion\u2014might have hurt her more than necessary. There's a balance between honesty and kindness.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the key points are: Is it fair to judge someone for their past relationships? Is the guy's reasoning valid, or is it a form of double standard? The mutual friend's reaction suggests that others see it as sexist, but the guy doesn't agree. There's also the aspect of professional aspirations; he's worried about his career, which is valid, but the girl's dating history shouldn't be a barrier unless it directly affects their relationship's success.\n\nI think the answer hinges on personal choice versus judgment. While he's not obligated to date someone, the reasons he gives might be seen as discriminatory. Society often frowns upon using someone's sexual history as a dealbreaker, especially if it's based on gender. So, even if he's within his rights, he might be in the wrong for the judgmental attitude rather than the decision itself.\n"
