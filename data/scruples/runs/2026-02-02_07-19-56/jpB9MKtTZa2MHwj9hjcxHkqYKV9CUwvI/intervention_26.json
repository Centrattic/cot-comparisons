She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history, specifically that she's slept with 12 guys on his college football team.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: he doesn't date girls who have slept with his friends (using the \"don't shit where you eat\" analogy) and he doesn't want to date someone who's after athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" situation. He ended things when she asked to date, admitted it was because of her sexual history with his teammates, and then a mutual friend accused him of sexism.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's consider the ethics here. The author is making a judgment based on her past relationships, which she didn't hide. But is that fair? It depends on whether his reasons are valid. The first reason is about avoiding drama. If he's friends with the teammates, maybe he's concerned about jealousy or conflicts. But that's his personal boundary. The second reason is about not wanting to date someone who might be into athletes for superficial reasons. That's a bit more about assumptions\u2014assuming she's only after athletes because of their status, which might not be fair. \n\nHe also mentioned that if the genders were reversed, he'd have the same stance. That might mitigate the sexism claim, but the mutual friend still called him sexist. The question is whether the author is making a valid choice based on his values or being discriminatory. \n\nIn relationships, people have different deal-breakers. If the author is clear about his boundaries before getting involved, it's his right to decide. However, if he's making assumptions about her motives without her confirming, that's problematic. The girl might not be a \"ball bunny\" but just has a history. The author's decision is about his comfort, which is valid, but some might see it as judgmental. \n\nThe key points are: he was honest after declining, respected her by not continuing the relationship, and had personal reasons. The mutual friend's reaction might be overreacting, but the author could be seen as applying a standard that's not about her character but her past. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a subjective matter. If he's not pressuring her to change or being cruel, his choice is his to make. But if the society values non-judgmental attitudes, his reasons might not be valid. However, personal boundaries are allowed. I think the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong because it's his right to set personal boundaries, even if others disagree.\n"
