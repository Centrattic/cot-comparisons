She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who ended a potential relationship with a girl because she had slept with many of his teammates. He lists two main reasons: not dating someone who slept with friends and not wanting a relationship with someone who's after athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy's reasoning seems to be about personal boundaries and avoiding drama. He mentions that he's not comfortable with dating someone who has a history with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's a common analogy for not mixing different aspects of life. Also, his second point is about not wanting to be in a relationship with someone he sees as a \"ball bunny,\" which might imply he's concerned about her motives or reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might feel hurt because her sexual history is being held against her. The mutual friend called the guy sexist, which could indicate that there's a perception of double standards. If the guy had similar preferences (like sleeping with guys on his team) and a guy rejected him for that, would it be fair? Or is this about different social norms and expectations for women versus men? That's a key point. The guy argues that his decision would be the same regardless of gender, but society often treats women's sexual histories more judgmentally than men's, which can be seen as sexist.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong. Legally, no one is wrong here; it's a personal choice. But morally or socially, it's more complex. The guy is setting boundaries, which is his right, but the way he's justified them might be problematic. Using the number of partners as a reason could be seen as judgmental or discriminatory. Also, the label of \"ball bunny\" might be derogatory and based on stereotypes.\n\nAnother angle is the mutual friend's reaction. If the friend called him a sexist asshole, it's possible there's a perception of bias. If the guy was a woman and the girl was a man with the same history, would the reaction be the same? The guy claims he would react the same, but societal expectations might not align with that.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If we consider that everyone has the right to set their own relationship boundaries, then he's not in the wrong for choosing not to date someone based on his criteria. However, if the criteria are based on outdated or sexist views (judging the girl's behavior more harshly than a man's would be judged), then he might be in the wrong. The fact that he's comparing his own hypothetical situation to a man's might not hold up, as societal standards often differ.\n\nIn summary, the guy has the right to his preferences, but if his reasoning is rooted in gender stereotypes or unfair judgment, then he could be in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his reasons are based on personal boundaries or harmful stereotypes.\n"
