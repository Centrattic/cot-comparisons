She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully. The author was casually dating a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with 12 guys from his college football team. He decided not to date her for two reasons: first, he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" and second, he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes because he might go pro and doesn't want a \"ball bunny\" relationship.\n\nWhen she asked to try dating, he said no. She guessed the reason was her sexual history with his teammates, and he confirmed it. She was hurt, but they parted ways. Then a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. He argues that if he were gay and the girl was a guy, he'd make the same choice. Also, he mentions the potential for being roasted by others or dealing with insecurity.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, answering A or B.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's reasoning. His first boundary is not dating someone who's slept with his friends. That's a personal boundary, but is it fair? It depends on how that standard is applied. If he has a consistent boundary, maybe it's his right to set it. However, applying it to others might be seen as judgmental, especially if it's about their past relationships. He compares it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" which is a metaphor for avoiding bad choices, but it's a bit of a stretch in terms of relationships. \n\nSecond, he doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes. That's more about his perception of her intentions. He says he doesn't want a \"ball bunny,\" which is a term often used derogatorily towards women who seek relationships with athletes. This could be seen as sexist, as it's a stereotype that assumes women are only after athletes for their status or money. His friend called him sexist, which suggests that others might see it that way. \n\nHe argues that if the roles were reversed, he'd make the same choice. However, the situation isn't symmetrical. If he were a woman in this scenario and the girl was into guys who were into her, it might be a different context. But here, his reasoning is based on stereotypes about women's behavior. \n\nAlso, refusing to date someone solely based on their sexual history, especially past relationships that don't involve him, could be seen as discriminatory. Everyone has a sexual history, and assuming someone's character or intentions based on that is problematic. His reasons might be valid for him personally, but they can be perceived as discriminatory or unfair. \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction as sexist might be valid because the author is making a judgment based on her past and his assumptions about her type of partner. Even if he states it's about boundaries, the judgment of her as a \"ball bunny\" is a stereotype. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that these are personal choices, and he's not obligated to be in a relationship if he has these boundaries. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if his reasons are based on stereotypes or prejudice, then he might be in the wrong. If it's about personal preferences and boundaries, then it's more about personal choice. \n\nBut in relationship ethics, it's important to consider if the reasons are respectful. Judging someone's past sexual relationships and making assumptions about their character can be seen as disrespectful. The author's reasoning might be seen as holding her to an unfair standard. \n\nSo, while the author is within his right to set personal boundaries, the way he frames his reasons could be considered sexist or discriminatory. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because his reasons are based on stereotypes and assumptions about her intentions and behavior.\n"
