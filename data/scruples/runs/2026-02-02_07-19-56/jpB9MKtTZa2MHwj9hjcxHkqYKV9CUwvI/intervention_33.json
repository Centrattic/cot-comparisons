She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he turned down a girl he was casually seeing because she had slept with multiple guys on his college football team. He gave two main reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and not wanting to date someone who targets athletes because he's aiming to go pro.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his reasons. His first point is about boundaries. He's stating he has a personal boundary not to date someone who's slept with his friends. That's his choice, but is it a valid reason? Well, people have different standards, so it's his right to set that boundary. However, it might be seen as a judgment of her past actions, which could be problematic. But he's not forcing her to change; he's just deciding it's incompatible with his own values.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes. He's concerned about the relationship being based on his athletic status rather than who he is as a person. That's a valid concern for him. But does that make him sexist? If he's applying the same standard to men, then it's not sexist. However, if he's only judging women for this, then it could be. The user mentions that if the situation were reversed (he was into guys and she was a guy sleeping with his friends), he'd have the same reaction. That suggests he's applying the same standard regardless of gender, which might mitigate the sexism claim.\n\nThe girl was hurt, and a mutual friend accused him of sexism. The key here is whether his reasons are discriminatory. If he's not holding women to a standard that men aren't held to, then it's not sexist. For example, if he also wouldn't date a guy who slept with his friends, then it's not sexist. The user claims he would apply the same logic regardless of gender, so that's a point in his favor.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of personal choice in relationships. People have the right to choose partners based on their personal values. However, some might argue that it's unfair to judge someone's worth based on their past relationships, especially if it's not relevant to the current relationship's success. But the user is clear that it's about his own comfort and boundaries, not her worth.\n\nThe mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. That's a strong accusation. To determine if that's accurate, we have to see if his judgment is based on gender. Since he's applying the same standard to men, as he stated, then it's not based on gender. Therefore, the friend's accusation might be unfounded. However, the way he's framing his reasons could be seen as contributing to a negative stereotype about women who date athletes (ball bunnies), which might still be problematic even if not sexist in intent.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key is whether his actions were reasonable. He was honest with her, even though it was a hard conversation. He didn't lie; he gave her a direct answer. The girl was hurt, but that's an emotional reaction, not necessarily a moral failing on his part. People can have different values, and it's okay to part ways if there's a mismatch.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not being sexist and is being honest about his boundaries, then maybe not. But if his reasons are based on outdated or unfair standards about women's behavior, then he might be. The line between personal boundaries and sexism can be thin here. The user's reasoning seems to hinge on personal choice and avoiding potential drama, which are valid, but the way it's framed could be seen as judgmental.\n\nGiven that he's consistent in his judgment regardless of gender (as per his own statement) and that he's being honest, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the standard itself is unfair or contributes to negative stereotypes, even if not directly sexist. It's a nuanced situation where personal choice meets social expectations.\n"
