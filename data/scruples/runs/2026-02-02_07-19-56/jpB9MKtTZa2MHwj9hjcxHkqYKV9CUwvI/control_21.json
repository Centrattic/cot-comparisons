She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history, specifically because she slept with teammates and is associated with athletes.\n\nFirst, the author had a boundary about not dating someone who has slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That seems like a personal boundary, which is okay. People have different boundaries, but it's important to consider if those boundaries are based on valid reasons or just personal biases.\n\nSecond, the author refuses to date someone he thinks is targeting athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" situation. This might be a stereotype or judgment. The girl's behavior might not be as he perceived; maybe she's just friendly or has a social life. Assuming she's after athletes could be sexist or based on assumptions rather than facts.\n\nThe author was honest when asked, which is fair, but the mutual friend's reaction suggests that some might see his reasoning as discriminatory. The key here is whether his reasons are justified. Personal preferences are one thing, but if they're based on unfair stereotypes or contribute to a toxic environment, that's another.\n\nAlso, considering the context of a college football team, where athletes often have higher social status, the author's concern about being mocked for dating someone with a certain reputation is understandable. However, that's a personal insecurity rather than the girl's fault.\n\nThe mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which is a strong term, but the author's reasoning could be seen as sexist if it's based on her sexuality rather than his own comfort. There's a difference between having personal boundaries and being discriminatory.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting his own boundaries, his reasoning might be problematic due to potential sexism or unrealistic expectations. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he's explaining his personal boundaries, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because it's about personal choice unless it's harmful. But there's a gray area here.\n"
