She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not dating a girl because she had slept with many of his teammates. His reasons are two-fold: he doesn't date people who have slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and he doesn't date girls who go after athletes, fearing becoming a \"ball bunny.\"\n\nFirst, the first reason: he draws a boundary about not dating someone who's slept with his friends. But is that a valid reason? It's his personal boundary, so he's within his rights to set that. However, it's a bit judgmental. The girl's choice to have relationships with others isn't inherently his problem unless it directly affects him. If they were in a monogamous relationship, that's one thing, but since they were just casually seeing each other, her past actions might not matter as much. Still, he's stating his own preferences, so not entirely in the wrong for that.\n\nSecond, the \"ball bunny\" concern. This is about his own insecurities or preconceptions. He's worried about her being a \"ball bunny,\" which is a stereotype against women who date athletes. This could be sexist, as it judges her based on her past relationships and his assumption about her intentions. He's projecting his fears onto her, which isn't fair. By not wanting to date her because of her past relationships with athletes, he's making a judgment that might not be based on her actual behavior in the relationship.\n\nHe also mentions that if the gender were reversed, his stance would be the same. But the issue here is that he's applying a standard that could be seen as double the standard if the genders were flipped. If a guy had slept with many of her teammates, would he have the same issue? If not, that's a problem. However, he's claiming consistency, but the problem lies in the underlying judgment about her motivations and his own insecurities about potential mockery or insecurity.\n\nThe mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, and maybe there's some merit to that. The argument that he's avoiding potential drama and insecurity is valid for him personally, but the way he's framing it might come off as judgmental. He's not considering her perspective or her autonomy in her relationships. It's his choice to date someone, but the reasoning might be based on outdated or sexist notions.\n\nSo, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his reasons are valid. Since he's setting his own boundaries, he's not in the wrong for choosing not to date her. However, the reasoning might be flawed or based on stereotypes. The question is about being in the wrong, not about whether his reasoning is sound. Since he's honest about his reasons and didn't force a relationship, he's not wrong for ending it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
