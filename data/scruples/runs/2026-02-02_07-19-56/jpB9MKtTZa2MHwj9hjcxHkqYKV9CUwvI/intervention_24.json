She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who ended a relationship because the girl had slept with many of his teammates and he didn't want to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy's reasons are two-fold: he doesn't date people who sleep with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and he doesn't want to date someone who seems to go after athletes because he might go pro. The girl was hurt, and a mutual friend called the guy sexist. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want others' thoughts.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to base a decision to not date someone on their sexual history and their association with his friends (teammates). \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, people have different boundaries. The author is being honest about his boundaries, which is important. However, the issue might be whether it's fair to judge someone's sexual history as a deal-breaker. Some might argue that it's his prerogative to set those boundaries, especially if it causes him discomfort. Others might say that it's sexist or judgmental to hold someone's past against them, especially in a society where such issues are increasingly seen as personal choices without bearing on the current relationship.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction calling him a sexist asshole suggests a possible bias. The author claims it's the same if the genders were reversed, but that might not be the case. If he's dating a man who slept with his teammates, it might not be the same due to societal double standards. That could be a point where his reasoning is seen as sexist.\n\nAlso, the girl's actions might be within her rights to have those relationships. The author's reasoning could be valid for himself, but the way he communicated it might have hurt her feelings. The fact that he didn't want to tell the whole truth but ended up confirming her suspicion might have made it more personal than necessary.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, setting personal boundaries isn't inherently wrong, but the judgment of others' sexual history can be problematic. The key is whether it's his right to have those boundaries or if it's discriminatory. Since relationships are subjective, it's hard to say he's in the wrong for prioritizing his own comfort. However, the societal context and potential for judgment might tip the scale in the other direction.\n\nConsidering all that, I think there's a balance. While he's being honest, using someone's sexual history as a deal-breaker could be seen as unfair. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because it's a judgmental stance that might not be respectful of her autonomy. But others might side with B, saying he's just setting his own boundaries. However, given the mutual friend's reaction and the potential for sexist undertones, leaning towards A makes sense.\n"
