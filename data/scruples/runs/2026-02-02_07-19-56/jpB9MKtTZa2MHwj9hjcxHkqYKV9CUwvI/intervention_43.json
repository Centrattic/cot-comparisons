She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history with his teammates.\n\nFirst, the main points from the author's reasoning: he doesn't date girls who have slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and he avoids dating girls who target athletes. He ended the relationship when she asked to date, admitting it was because she had slept with many of his teammates.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Personal boundaries are important. If someone has a boundary about dating people who've slept with their friends, that's their choice. But is it fair to judge someone based on their past sexual partners? In many discussions, people argue against double standards, especially regarding women's sexual history. The author mentions that if he were into guys and she were a guy, his reaction would be the same. That suggests he's not being sexist, but it's still a judgment about someone's sexual history which some might see as problematic.\n\nThe other person's reaction was hurt, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The author feels it's not fair because he's applying the same standard if the genders were reversed. However, societal norms often treat men and women differently in these scenarios. Men might get praised for having many partners, while women are stigmatized. But the author claims he's not sexist, so maybe he's trying to avoid that stigma.\n\nAlso, the second reason about dating a \"ball bunny\" (a term often used pejoratively for women who have many sexual partners, especially with athletes) might be based on stereotypes. The author is concerned about the reputation and potential insecurities, which are personal feelings but not necessarily justified.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, people should be allowed to have their past relationships without being judged in a current relationship. The author's reasoning is based on personal comfort and boundaries, which are valid, but they might also be seen as discriminatory if they're based on outdated or unfair standards.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to his personal boundaries, the judgment based on someone's sexual history, especially if it's a common thing among peers, might be considered unfair or hypocritical by others. So, the answer could be that he's not in the wrong, but his reasoning may be seen as problematic by some.\n"
