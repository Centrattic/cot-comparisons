She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario is about a guy who was seeing a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with 12 guys on his college football team. He decided not to date her because of that. His reasons are two-fold: 1) He doesn't date people he's friends with (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\"), and 2) He doesn't want to date someone who's after athletes, especially since he's aiming for a pro career. \n\nHe was honest when she asked, and then his mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. Let's think about societal norms and personal boundaries. The author is setting personal boundaries, which is his right. He's explaining that he values not dating people who have had relationships with his friends, which is a common concern. Also, his concern about dating someone with a reputation as a \"ball bunny\" relates to his personal preferences and future goals.\n\nBut some might argue that he's making a judgment based on her past, which could be seen as unfair or sexist. However, he's not judging her character but setting boundaries based on his own comfort and future. The key here is whether his reasons are valid. He's being honest about his boundaries, even though it might come across as harsh. \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction could be more about their own feelings towards the girl or the situation. The author didn't force her or lie; he was upfront about his reasons. So, while some might find his reasons problematic, if he's being honest and not coercive, it's his choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering he's setting personal boundaries and being honest, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). However, some might say it's wrong because of the potential sexism. But his reasoning is based on his own values, not hers. So I think the correct answer is B.\n"
