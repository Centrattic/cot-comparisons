She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who was casually dating a girl but decided not to pursue a serious relationship because she had slept with multiple guys on his college football team. He gave two reasons: he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends, and he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if his reasons are valid. The first point is about personal boundaries. He compares it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" which is a common metaphor for not mixing certain things. If that's a boundary he's had all along, then it's his personal choice. But is it fair to the girl? She might see that as a double standard if he's okay with his female friends but not his potential girlfriend. But the key here is that it's his boundary, so unless it's harmful, maybe it's his prerogative.\n\nThe second reason is about her being a \"ball bunny,\" which is a derogatory term for women who are perceived to be after athletes for their money or fame. The guy mentions he's aiming to go pro, so he's worried about being in a relationship where the woman is after his potential success. This is more about his perception. However, the term \"ball bunny\" is often used in a sexist way, implying that women are only interested in athletes for superficial reasons. The girl might have been genuinely interested in him as a person, not just his status. So here, the guy is making an assumption about her intentions based on her past relationships, which could be problematic. \n\nHe didn't want to tell her the real reason but admitted it when she guessed. She was hurt, and a mutual friend accused him of being sexist. The guy argues that if the situation were reversed (if he was into guys and the girl was a guy who had slept with his friends), his reasoning would be the same. That's a valid point about consistency, but the context is different. The term \"ball bunny\" is inherently gendered, and his concern about being \"roasted\" or dealing with insecurity due to her reputation adds another layer of judgment based on her past.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community usually looks at whether the person acted in a fair, respectful, and considerate way. The guy was honest with his reasons and didn't hide them once called out. He also acknowledged she was a cool person but their boundaries didn't match. However, his reasoning could be seen as sexist because it's based on her sexual history and assumptions about her motives, which are not his to judge. The friend's reaction as sexist is likely because the guy made a decision based on her past and his perception of her intentions, which can be seen as holding a double standard.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), it's because his reasons might be based on sexist assumptions and judgments about her. If B (no), it's because he's setting personal boundaries and being honest about them. The key here is whether his reasons are justifiable. Personal boundaries are okay, but if they are rooted in sexism, then he's in the wrong. The term \"ball bunny\" is a sexist trope, so using that as a reason to reject her might make him the asshole. Also, the idea that dating someone with a certain sexual history is a dealbreaker could be seen as hypocritical or judgmental, especially in modern dating where such judgments are less socially accepted. However, if he's clear about his boundaries and respects her as a person, it's a personal choice. But the way he frames it, using terms like \"ball bunny\" and worrying about being mocked, might indicate a problem. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
