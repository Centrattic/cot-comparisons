She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that he was casually seeing a girl for two months but decided not to date her because she had slept with many guys on his football team. He had two main reasons: not wanting to date someone who's slept with his friends, and not wanting a relationship with someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if his reasons are valid. The first reason is about personal boundaries. He compares it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" which implies he doesn't want drama. That's a personal choice, but is it wrong? Well, it's his right to set boundaries. However, it's also a judgment about her based on her sexual history, which some might see as shallow or sexist. But he argues that if it were the opposite (he was into guys and she was into him), he'd have the same stance. That might suggest consistency, but it's still about her past relationships with his friends.\n\nThe second reason is about avoiding being in a relationship with someone he calls a \"ball bunny,\" which is a derogatory term for women who pursue athletes. That's more problematic because it's a stereotype and could be seen as sexist. It's a judgment based on her behavior towards athletes, not just her sexual history. Plus, considering her interest in athletes as a negative might be unfair, especially if she's just being attracted to them, which is natural.\n\nHe didn't want to explain his reasons, which led to her being hurt. He did acknowledge she was a nice person but said it was a mismatch in boundaries. The mutual friend called him sexist, which adds another layer. The guy claims he wouldn't have acted differently if the genders were reversed, but the way he frames his reasons is still based on her sexual partners and his own biases.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether his reasoning is acceptable. While everyone has the right to set boundaries, the reasons he gave could be seen as superficial or discriminatory. The first reason is a personal boundary, which is okay, but the second reason is more about stereotypes. Also, judging someone's worth based on their past sexual partners is a common criticism in such situations. \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction might not be justified either, but the user is focused on the original person. In many AITA scenarios, the community often criticizes judgments based on sexual history as outdated or sexist. So, even if the person has the right to choose, the reasons might be considered wrong by many. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because his reasons are based on superficial and potentially sexist criteria. However, others might argue that he's within his rights to set boundaries. But given the context and common societal views, the more likely answer is A.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author\u2019s reasoning is problematic. While individuals have the right to set personal boundaries, the basis for his decision reflects superficial and potentially sexist judgments. Dismissing someone solely based on their sexual history or their attraction to athletes perpetuates harmful stereotypes and double standards. The mutual friend\u2019s criticism highlights the issue of projecting personal biases as objective concerns. The author\u2019s refusal to acknowledge deeper motivations or consider the woman\u2019s perspective further underscores a lack of accountability. The decision to end the relationship is not inherently wrong, but the reasoning behind it is. \n\n**Answer: A**",
