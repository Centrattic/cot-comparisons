She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that he was seeing a girl for two months and decided not to date her because she had slept with 12 guys on his college football team. He lists two reasons: one is not dating someone who's slept with his friends, and the second is that he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes because he might go pro. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Is it fair for him to use her sexual history as a reason to not date her? The question is about whether he's being sexist or if it's a personal boundary issue. He mentions that if she were a guy and he was into guys, he'd have the same standards. That might be his way of defending against the charge of sexism. But does that actually hold up? \n\nHis first reason is not wanting to date someone who's slept with friends. That's a personal boundary, right? People have different comfort levels. If he's clear that this is a boundary of his, then he's not necessarily in the wrong for stating that. However, the problem could be if he's applying this boundary in a way that's discriminatory. For example, if he's only applying it to women and not to men, that would be a problem. But the question is whether he's in the wrong as an individual, not necessarily if his reasoning is valid in a broader societal context.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who targets athletes. That's more about his personal preferences. If he's honest about his preferences, that's okay. The issue might come up if he's making a judgment based on stereotypes, like assuming that all women who date athletes are \"ball bunnies\" without knowing them. But the girl in question had a history with many athletes, so maybe he's justified in his reasoning based on her specific actions.\n\nHe also mentions that a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. That friend might think he's being biased, but the author argues that if the roles were reversed, he'd have the same standards. But does that hold true? If he's judging a woman's behavior as a deal-breaker in a way that he wouldn't judge a man's, that's sexist. However, he's stated that he applies the same standard to both genders. \n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. The woman had a right to her sexual history without being judged. By using her past as a reason to reject her, is he violating her autonomy? It's a personal choice to date someone or not, but using her sexual history as a reason could be seen as holding her to double standards. However, if it's his personal preference, then it's his choice. \n\nAlso, the comparison to \"don't shit where you eat\" is a common analogy. It's about not wanting to be in a relationship where there's overlap with friends' partners. That's a common boundary. But does that make it wrong? If he's been upfront about his boundaries from the start, then it's his right to decline. However, the problem might be in how he communicated it. He said he didn't want to tell her the real reason at first, which could be seen as dishonesty. \n\nIn summary, the key points are whether his reasons are based on personal boundaries he's communicated, whether he's applying them equally to all genders, and whether his judgment is based on stereotypes. If he's consistent and honest, then he's not in the wrong. If he's being discriminatory, then he is. The answer hinges on whether his reasoning is a personal choice or a form of bias.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. While individuals have the right to personal boundaries, the reasoning here is problematic. Judging someone's sexual history as a deal-breaker can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and double standards, especially when applied selectively to women. The author's refusal to engage in a relationship based on the woman's past partners, while not explicitly violating laws or ethics, reflects a judgment rooted in traditional gender norms. Additionally, the claim that he would have the same standards if roles were reversed is questionable, as societal expectations often differ for men and women in these contexts. The mutual friend's reaction highlights the potential for this reasoning to be perceived as sexist. While personal preference is valid, the way the author frames his decision may unfairly burden the woman and overlook her autonomy.",
