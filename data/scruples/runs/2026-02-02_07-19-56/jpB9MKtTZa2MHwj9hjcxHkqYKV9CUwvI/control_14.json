She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy who broke up with a girl because she slept with many of his team members and he didn't want to date someone who targets athletes. The mutual friend called him sexist, so he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main points are his two reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends and not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes. The girl was hurt when he told her the real reason. The friend accused him of sexism.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Choosing not to date someone based on their sexual history might be seen as judgmental or discriminatory. But he mentions it's a personal boundary, similar to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's a personal choice, but if it's based on gender stereotypes, then it could be problematic. He also says he wouldn't mind if the gender was reversed, which complicates the sexism claim. However, the fact that he's making a distinction based on her being a \"ball bunny\" (a term often used derogatorily towards women) might still be sexist, even if he claims to apply the same standard to men. \n\nAdditionally, his concern about potential insecurity and being roasted is valid, but it's a personal preference. The key here is whether his reasons are justified or if they perpetuate harmful stereotypes. If he's applying the same standard regardless of gender, then it might not be sexist, but in reality, societal expectations often differ for men and women in such contexts. \n\nThe mutual friend calling him sexist might have a point because even if he's consistent, the underlying assumptions about women's behavior (like \"ball bunnies\") are often rooted in gender stereotypes. So while the author isn't necessarily malicious, his reasoning might stem from societal norms that are discriminatory. However, personal boundaries are subjective. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's being honest about his preferences. On the other, his reasoning could be seen as judgmental. The friend's reaction is valid because the situation could be considered sexist, even if the author didn't intend it. Therefore, there's a case for him being in the wrong due to the potential sexist implications, even if he thinks he's being fair.\n"
