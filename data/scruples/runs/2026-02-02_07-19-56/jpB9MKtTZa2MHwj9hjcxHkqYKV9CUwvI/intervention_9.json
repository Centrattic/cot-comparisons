She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who was dating a girl for two months and then decided not to pursue a serious relationship because she had slept with multiple guys on his football team. He also mentions disliking the idea of dating someone who goes after athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons he gave. His first reason is about not dating someone who's slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's a personal boundary he's had. The second reason is about not wanting to be in a relationship with someone he sees as a \"ball bunny,\" especially since he has a chance to go pro. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, people have different values and boundaries. If he genuinely felt that her past relationships with his teammates would cause him unnecessary drama or discomfort, then choosing not to date her isn't inherently wrong. It's about his personal preferences.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of how he handled it. He didn't want to tell her the real reason initially, but when she asked, he confirmed it. The girl felt hurt, which is understandable. But he did clarify that it wasn't about her being a bad person\u2014it was a mismatch in boundaries. \n\nThe mutual friend called him sexist. The guy argues that if he were into guys and she was a guy sleeping with his friends, he'd feel the same. That might be a valid point about not being sexist, but it's worth considering if there's a double standard. Also, his comment about \"ball bunnies\" being a nightmare could imply a bias against women who are sexually active, which might be seen as problematic, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn relationships, everyone has different deal-breakers. If someone has a boundary they're not willing to cross, they're not necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to be in a relationship. However, the way he dismissed her and the potential for his reasoning to be based on societal expectations or stereotypes could affect the judgment.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer hinges on whether his reasons are personal boundaries versus harmful judgments. If it's the former, he's not in the wrong. If it's the latter, maybe he is. But based on the information given, it seems like he's following his own boundaries, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
