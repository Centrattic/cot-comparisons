She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history involving his college football teammates. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author mentions two main boundaries: not dating someone who's slept with his friends, and not dating someone who seems to target athletes. He also mentions the potential drama and insecurity if they dated.\n\nThe girl in question had slept with multiple teammates, which he found off-putting. He told her the truth, which hurt her feelings, and a friend accused him of being sexist. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author's reasons are personal boundaries. People have different standards for relationships, and as long as he's honest, it's his right to choose. However, there's a nuance here. By judging her based on her sexual history with his teammates, is that a form of sexism? The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which might indicate some societal bias against such judgments. \n\nBut the author argues that if he were a woman in a similar situation, his decision would be the same. That suggests he's not biased against her gender but against the specific context. The issue then becomes whether it's fair to have such a boundary. Some might say it's his choice, others might see it as outdated or judgmental.\n\nThe key point is that the author is being honest about his boundaries. He's not pressuring her to change, he's just deciding not to date her. Unless his reasons are based on harmful stereotypes or discrimination, he's acting within his rights. The problem is whether the reasoning is valid. If someone else had a similar history with his friends, would he react the same way? If yes, then it's a personal choice. If no, it might be biased.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's making a personal decision based on his values. However, others might criticize his reasoning as being influenced by societal norms or insecurity. But since he's honest and not imposing his standards on her, the answer leans towards not being in the wrong.\n"
