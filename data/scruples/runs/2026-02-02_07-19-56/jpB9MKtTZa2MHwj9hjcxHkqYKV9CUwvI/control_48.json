She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history. The situation is that they were casually dating for two months, and the girl had slept with several guys on the football team. The author has two main reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and not wanting to date someone who's after athletes, especially since he might go pro.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is making a judgment based on her sexual history, which is a common point of debate. In many modern contexts, people argue that someone's past relationships or sexual history shouldn't affect current dating decisions. However, personal boundaries and comfort levels are also important. The author's reasoning is about avoiding drama and not wanting to date someone they perceive as a \"ball bunny,\" which might be a stereotype.\n\nThe girl was hurt when he admitted it was about her sleeping with teammates. The mutual friend also called him sexist. I need to assess whether the author's reasons are valid or if they're being discriminatory. The author claims it's a boundary they've always had, which is their personal choice. However, using someone's sexual history as a deal-breaker can sometimes be seen as judgmental or hypocritical, especially if the same standard isn't applied to their own partners.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about \"ball bunnies\" might imply a double standard. If the roles were reversed and the girl was into guys who had relationships with her friends, would the author have the same issue? The author mentions they would have the same stance if genders were reversed, but that might not hold true in reality. The mutual friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions might be seen as sexist, even if they don't intend it to be.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about their boundaries. They didn't want to continue the relationship if it was going to cause them discomfort. It's their right to set personal limits. However, the question is whether it's wrong to base the decision on her past relationships, especially since she wasn't in a relationship with the author's teammates in a romantic sense\u2014they were friends, and the author's boundary is about not dating someone connected to friends.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at intent and whether the action was reasonable. The author is being honest, but the reason might be seen as judgmental. The girl might feel that her past is none of his business, especially if it's not affecting the current relationship. However, the author's concern about potential drama and insecurities is valid for their own peace of mind.\n\nSo, weighing these points: the author isn't in the wrong for having personal boundaries, but using someone's sexual history as a deal-breaker can be viewed as unfair or hypocritical. However, since the author is clear about their reasons and it's their choice who they date, it might not be \"asshole\" territory. The mutual friend's reaction might be overblown, but the author's reasoning could be seen as sexist stereotypes. Therefore, the answer might be AITA, but depending on perspective. The key is whether the author's reasons are valid. If it's about personal comfort and boundaries, they might not be wrong, but if it's a blanket judgment without considering her character, they might be in the wrong.\n"
