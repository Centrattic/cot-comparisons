She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he was seeing a girl for two months, but she's slept with 12 guys on his college football team. He decided not to date her because of that, giving two main reasons: not dating people who have slept with his friends and not wanting a relationship with someone who seems to target athletes. The girl got hurt, a mutual friend is upset, calling him sexist, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his reasoning. His first point is about not dating someone who's had relationships with his friends. That feels a bit like a personal boundary, but it's also a bit odd. If he's friends with those guys, maybe they're also his teammates, so she's sleeping with his friends and teammates. That could create drama, as he said. But is it fair to hold that against her? It might depend on the context. If she's part of the team's social circle, maybe she's just being social. But if he's friends with those guys, having a romantic partner who's slept with them could be awkward.\n\nSecond, he doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" scenario. That's a stereotype, and he's worried about her intentions. But he mentions that if the roles were reversed, he'd make the same choice, which he thinks makes it fair. However, the mutual friend is upset and calls him sexist. That's a strong accusation. Is it sexist to be concerned about a partner's sexual history? Or is it just a personal preference? There's a line between personal preferences and discriminatory behavior. If he's making a judgment based on her number of past partners, that could be seen as holding a double standard, especially if he wouldn't care about a male partner's similar history. But he says he wouldn't care if he were dating a guy who had slept with his friends. So maybe he's not sexist, but maybe the way he's phrasing it comes off as such.\n\nThe girl was hurt when he told her. He was honest but maybe could have been more sensitive. However, he did say he thought she was cool and it was a mismatch, which is reasonable. The mutual friend's anger might stem from thinking he's being sexist, but the friend might have their own feelings involved. The author is trying to avoid drama and potential insecurity, which is understandable. But is it fair to judge someone's worth based on their past relationships? People have different standards, but some might see this as judgmental.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. He's being honest about his boundaries, which is okay, but the issue is whether those boundaries are justified. If he's not in a relationship with those teammates, maybe their relationships don't interfere. But if he's close friends with them, it's a different story. Also, the number of partners might be irrelevant to the relationship's success. The key here is whether his reasons are valid and respectful. He's not forced to date anyone, so it's his choice. However, the way he's explaining it might come across as discriminatory, especially if others perceive it as sexist. But he's not making a blanket statement against women, just his own preferences. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but others might disagree depending on their views on personal boundaries and gender roles.\n"
