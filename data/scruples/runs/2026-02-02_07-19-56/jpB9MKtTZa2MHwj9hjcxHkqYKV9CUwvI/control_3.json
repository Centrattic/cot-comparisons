She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship.

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history and her relationships with his teammates.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was casually seeing a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with at least 12 guys on his college football team. When she asked to start dating, he declined, citing two main reasons: 1) He doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\"), and 2) He doesn't want to date someone who \"goes after athletes\" because he might go pro and wants to avoid being in a relationship with someone he sees as a \"ball bunny.\" \n\nHe told her the first reason, which upset her. A mutual friend who has feelings for her then called the author a sexist asshole. The author argues that if the genders were reversed (he was into guys and she was a guy), his decision would be the same. He also mentions not wanting the drama or potential insecurity from being in such a relationship.\n\nNow, considering whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are about personal boundaries and potential judgment based on someone's sexual history. \n\nIn many modern relationships, people advocate for not judging others based on their past partners. The author's first reason is about personal boundaries\u2014some people might find it uncomfortable or a conflict to date someone who's been with their friends. However, others might argue that it's a double standard or sexist to hold that boundary. \n\nThe second point about \"ball bunnies\" could be seen as a stereotype or a way to devalue women who are interested in athletes. The term itself is derogatory and might come off as dismissive of the woman's agency. The author's reasoning here could be seen as sexist, as it's making a judgment based on a woman's behavior rather than her character.\n\nThe friend's reaction calls him a sexist, which adds another layer. If the author would have the same issue regardless of gender, does that mitigate the sexism? Maybe, but the use of terms like \"ball bunny\" are inherently gendered and problematic. \n\nAlso, the woman's actions don't necessarily make her a \"ball bunny\"\u2014she might have slept with many people for various reasons, and it's not up to the author to judge that. His reasons seem more about his own comfort and social dynamics rather than the woman's behavior being objectively problematic.\n\nSo, while the author has a right to his boundaries, the way he's framed his reasons might cross into judgment based on stereotypes. The key is whether his reasons are about mutual respect and compatibility or about controlling behavior and societal stereotypes. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if someone has a personal boundary about not dating people who've been with their friends, that's one thing, but applying it in a way that's sexist or devaluing is another. The author's second reason seems more like a red flag for potential judgment based on a stereotype rather than a legitimate concern.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because his reasoning includes sexist assumptions and potentially harmful stereotypes, even if he's being honest about his boundaries.\n"
