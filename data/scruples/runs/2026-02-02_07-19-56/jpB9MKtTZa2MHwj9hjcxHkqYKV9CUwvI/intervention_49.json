She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not dating the girl because of her sexual history. The situation involves the girl sleeping with multiple teammates, and the author refusing to date her due to personal boundaries and concerns about her being a \"ball bunny.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal boundaries in relationships. The author's first reason is about not dating someone who's had sex with friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's a personal boundary, which is valid for some people. However, whether it's fair or not is subjective. Some might see it as a legitimate boundary, others might view it as judgmental or hypocritical, especially if the author has similar experiences but doesn't hold the same standards.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting a relationship with someone who's attracted to athletes. The author is concerned about being seen as a \"ball bunny,\" which might imply he's judging her motives. This could be seen as sexist if he's making assumptions about her intentions based on stereotypes about women and athletes. The mutual friend who called him an \"asshole\" might be reacting to this perceived sexism.\n\nAlso, the author didn't want to disclose the full reason initially but confirmed it when confronted. Honesty is important in relationships, so being upfront might have been better, even if it's uncomfortable. However, the girl was already hurt when he confirmed it, so maybe there's some fault in how he handled the conversation.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction suggests that some people see this as sexist. If the author's reasoning is based on stereotypes (like \"ball bunnies\" being a bad type of partner), that could be problematic. But if it's about his own personal preferences and boundaries, it's more about his own values. The author argues that if the roles were reversed (he was into guys and she was into him), he'd make the same decision, which he claims makes it not sexist. However, the comparison might not be perfect since the situations are different.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. The issue is more about morality and personal ethics. The question is whether the author's reasons are valid or if they perpetuate harmful stereotypes. If the author is making a judgment based on the number of partners and the context (teammates), some might argue that's his personal choice, but others might see it as unfair, especially if it's a double standard.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If he's standing by his boundaries without hurting others unnecessarily, some might support him. However, if his reasoning is rooted in sexist attitudes or double standards, then he could be at fault. The mutual friend's reaction and the potential for sexist assumptions make me lean towards the author being in the wrong. But others might side with his right to set personal boundaries.\n"
