She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy was casually seeing a girl for two months and then decided not to date her because she had slept with several guys on his football team. He gave two reasons: first, he doesn't date people who have slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" and second, he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes because he might go pro.\n\nHmm, the first reason is about his personal boundaries. He says he doesn't want the drama. Well, everyone has their own boundaries, right? If that's his line, he's within his right to not proceed. But then again, the girl's sexual history is her choice, and unless she was being non-consensual or something, it's her business. But he's not in the wrong for having that boundary. However, the fact that he's a football player and she's slept with teammates might add to the drama. Maybe he's avoiding potential team tensions, which is understandable.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date \"ball bunnies.\" Wait, that term \"ball bunny\" is a bit problematic. It's a stereotype that often targets women athletes or those interested in athletes as being promiscuous. He's making a judgment based on her dating history and her interest in athletes, which could be seen as sexist. The mutual friend called him sexist, and maybe that's valid. If he were a woman and the roles were reversed, would he be making the same judgment? He claims he would, but that's the key point. If he's applying the same standard regardless of gender, maybe it's not sexist. But the term \"ball bunny\" is inherently gendered and reinforces negative stereotypes. So that part might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nHe also mentions that if the girl had been a guy in his position, his answer would be the same. But the problem is that the judgment is based on gendered expectations. The mutual friend's reaction is likely because he's making a sexist assumption about the girl's behavior based on stereotypes. Also, the potential for being teased (\"chirps\") seems like it's more about his insecurity or the social dynamics of the football team rather than a valid reason to reject a relationship.\n\nIn terms of consent and personal choice, the girl's sexual history isn't something that makes her wrong. Unless there was some violation, it's her autonomy. So by rejecting her based on that, he's imposing his standards on her choices, which could be seen as unfair. The fact that he's a football player adds another layer because team dynamics can be very social and sensitive, leading to drama if they date. But that's more about his personal preferences than her wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the main issue is his use of gender-based judgments and stereotypes. If he's making a decision based on her being a \"ball bunny,\" which is a sexist label, then he's in the wrong. However, if his boundaries are purely about not wanting drama and he's applying them consistently regardless of gender, maybe not. But the way he's framing it, using terms like \"ball bunny\" and the mutual friend's reaction suggest that his reasoning has a sexist undertone. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the sexist implications, even if he's not outright discriminatory.\n"
