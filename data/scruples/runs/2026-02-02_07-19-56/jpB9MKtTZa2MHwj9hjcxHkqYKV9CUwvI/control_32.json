She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy was seeing a girl for two months and then decided not to date her because she had slept with 12 guys on his college football team. He gave two reasons: one, he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" and two, he doesn't want to date girls who go after athletes because he might go pro.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The guy is setting his personal boundaries, which is something everyone is entitled to do. He's not forcing anyone; he's just choosing not to pursue a relationship based on his own criteria. But then there's the other side: is it fair for him to judge her by her past relationships, especially if that's not something he would apply to himself in a same-sex situation? The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which makes me think people might see it as double standards. \n\nWait, the author mentions that if the roles were reversed and he was into guys, his answer would be the same. That's interesting. So he's saying it's not about gender but about the nature of the relationships. But does that hold up? If a guy had slept with a bunch of girls on his team, would he face the same judgment? Or is it that the problem is more about her targeting athletes rather than the number of partners? \n\nAlso, the girl's actions: she's with multiple teammates. If she's aware of the guy's position and still chose to be with them, maybe she's aware of the potential conflicts. But the guy's reasoning about avoiding drama and potential insecurity seems valid from his perspective. On the other hand, judging someone's past sexual history can be seen as hypocritical or judgmental, especially in a society that's moving towards more acceptance of people's past choices.\n\nAnother angle: the guy's concern about being a future professional athlete. If he's worried about being labeled a \"ball bunny\" or facing mockery, that's a personal concern. But does that justify not pursuing a relationship? It might be a personal choice, but is it fair to judge someone else's past based on that? \n\nThe mutual friend's reaction is also key. If other people see this as sexist, maybe there's a societal expectation that someone shouldn't judge a partner's past sexual activity. The author's defense about applying the same standard to himself if he were gay is a point, but does it address the core issue? It's possible that the real issue is the double standard in how people perceive men and women's sexual histories, but the author's reasoning is based on personal preferences rather than gender.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about personal choice. The guy isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily unethical by choosing not to date her. However, there's a social aspect where some might view it as unfair or judgmental. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for making a personal choice based on his boundaries. Since he's not harming her and it's about mutual consent, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that it's a form of hypocrisy or sexism if he's applying different standards.\n\nBut the author's point about not wanting to date someone who targets athletes is a personal boundary. If he's honest about that, it's his right. The problem might be that he's using a justification that could be seen as discriminatory, even if it's not his intention. So, depending on how one weighs personal choice versus societal expectations, the answer could swing either way. However, in terms of the question of being \"in the wrong,\" unless there's a direct harm or violation of agreed-upon norms in the relationship, it's more about personal choice.\n"
