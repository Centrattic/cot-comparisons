She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author was in a casual relationship with a girl who had slept with many of his teammates. He decided not to take it further, citing two main reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends, and not wanting a relationship with someone who targets athletes. The girl got hurt, and a mutual friend accused him of sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if his reasons are valid. The first point is about personal boundaries. People have different comfort levels regarding their partner's sexual history. Some might find it important, others not. The author compares it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" implying discomfort with a partner being in a space he's close to (his teammates). That's a personal choice, but is it wrong? Not necessarily, unless it's based on prejudice.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting a \"ball bunny,\" which can be a derogatory term implying someone only dates athletes for status or money. The author is worried about his professional future and potential insecurities. However, this might come off as assuming the girl's intentions are solely about his status as an athlete, which could be a stereotype. If he made that assumption without her confirming it, that's a problem.\n\nThe mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The author argues that if the roles were reversed, he'd still make the same choice. But that's a hypothetical. The issue here is that judging someone's sexual history as a dealbreaker can be seen as sexist, especially when it's a woman's history. There's an imbalance in societal expectations where men's sexual history is less scrutinized. By making her sexual history a dealbreaker, he's applying a standard that might not be applied to himself, which is a form of double standard.\n\nThe author's reasoning might be based on personal preferences, but acting on them without considering the implications can be problematic. The key is whether his actions are respecting the girl's autonomy. If she's being judged for her past relationships, that's a form of sexism. Also, the term \"ball bunny\" is a stereotype that can demean women who are seen as using athletes, which could be a projection on his part.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If his reasons are based on personal boundaries, that's his choice. But if those boundaries are rooted in sexist attitudes or double standards, then he might be in the wrong. The mutual friend's reaction suggests others see it as sexist. The author claims he's not sexist, but the core issue is the judgment based on her sexual history, which is a common area where sexism manifests.\n\nIn conclusion, while he has the right to his personal preferences, the reasons given can be seen as sexist and discriminatory. Therefore, the answer is A (he is in the wrong)."
