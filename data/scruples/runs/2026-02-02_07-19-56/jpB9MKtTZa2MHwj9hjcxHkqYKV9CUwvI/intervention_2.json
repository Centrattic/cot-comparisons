She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone who decided not to date a girl because she had slept with several members of their college football team. The author gives two main reasons: not dating someone who's slept with friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes, fearing it might affect his professional sports career.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal boundaries. The author has clear personal boundaries, which is their right. However, the question is whether those boundaries make them in the wrong. The girl was upfront about her history, and the author made a decision based on that. But the key issue here is whether the author's reasons are valid or if they're being discriminatory.\n\nThe first reason is about not dating someone who's slept with friends. That's a personal choice, but it can be seen as judgmental, especially if the author is okay with their own sexual history but judges others. It might also be a form of double standard if the author wouldn't mind if the roles were reversed.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who's interested in athletes because of his potential pro career. This could be seen as stereotyping women who are attracted to athletes, assuming they're \"ball bunnies,\" which is a derogatory term. This might reflect sexist attitudes, even if the author claims it's not about gender. By making a blanket statement, they could be perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\n\nThe mutual friend who's upset calls the author a sexist asshole, which makes me think there's an element of sexism here. The author's reasoning might be based on gendered expectations, which is problematic. The argument that they'd act the same way if the genders were reversed doesn't hold because the scenario is different\u2014sexuality and attraction dynamics aren't the same when reversed. Also, the term \"ball bunny\" is inherently gendered and derogatory towards women.\n\nAdditionally, the author didn't want to deal with potential jokes or insecurities, which is a personal issue but doesn't justify the judgment. The girl's sexual history shouldn't affect the author's self-esteem unless they have insecurities they need to address.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision is based on their own biases and stereotypes, which makes them in the wrong. They're applying standards that could be seen as discriminatory, even if they believe they're justified. The fact that the friend called them sexist suggests that others perceive it as such, and there's merit in that critique.\n"
