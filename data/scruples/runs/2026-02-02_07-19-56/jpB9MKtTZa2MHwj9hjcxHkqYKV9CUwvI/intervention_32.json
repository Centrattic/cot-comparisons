She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ended a potential relationship with a girl because she had slept with many of his teammates and he doesn't date women who have slept with his friends or those who go after athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author set clear boundaries: not dating someone who has slept with his friends and not dating someone who's interested in athletes. He communicated these when he said no. The girl asked directly if it was because of the teammates, and he confirmed. The mutual friend called him sexist. The author argues that if the roles were reversed, he'd have the same stance and that it's about avoiding drama and potential insecurities.\n\nNow, whether this makes him wrong. On one hand, he's being honest about his boundaries. People have different standards, and if this is his non-negotiable, he's not in the wrong for sticking to them. On the other hand, some might argue that judging someone based on their sexual history is sexist or that he should have been more considerate in his explanation. The mutual friend's reaction suggests others might see it as sexist, but the author defends his reasoning as being about mutual respect and avoiding conflict.\n\nI need to weigh personal autonomy versus societal norms. The author isn't forcing her to change; he's choosing not to date her based on his own criteria. As long as he's not pressuring her or treating her unfairly (like discriminating based on stereotypes), his decision is his own. The key is whether his reasoning is valid. If he's not being hypocritical (as he claims, if he were a woman and she was into men, same applies), then it's about personal preference. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
