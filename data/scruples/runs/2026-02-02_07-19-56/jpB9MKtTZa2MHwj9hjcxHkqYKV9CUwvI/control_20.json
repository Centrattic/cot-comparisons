She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not dating a girl because of her sexual history and her dating football teammates. The author had two main reasons: not wanting to date someone who slept with his friends and not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is being honest about his boundaries. He's not hiding his reasons, even though he initially didn't want to say them. He did explain it when she asked, so he's being truthful. But does that make him right or wrong? Well, it's about personal boundaries. People have different standards, and it's his choice to set those lines. However, there's also the issue of respecting her. By making a decision based on her past sexual partners, especially in a context where she's part of his team's environment, could that be seen as judgmental or even discriminatory?\n\nThen there's the mutual friend's reaction calling him sexist. Is that a valid reaction? If the author would have the same boundary regardless of gender, maybe the friend is right. The author claims he wouldn't care if the situation were reversed, but does that hold up? If the girl had been with other athletes and the author is an athlete, it's about mutual respect and boundaries. But is it fair to judge someone's past partners? That's a tricky point. Society is moving towards more acceptance, so using someone's sexual history as a dealbreaker might be seen as outdated or judgmental.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of relationships. If she's dating multiple teammates, does that make her a \"ball bunny\"? That term is derogatory and can be hurtful. The author's decision might stem from personal values, but labeling her in that way could be part of the problem. The mutual friend's anger could be because the author is contributing to a toxic environment for women in sports, perpetuating stereotypes.\n\nMoreover, the author is concerned about potential drama and being roasted. That's a personal comfort issue. It's his right to avoid situations that make him uncomfortable. However, if others are being judged for their dating choices, it can create a hostile environment. The key here is whether the author's decision is based on valid personal boundaries or on harmful stereotypes.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong in terms of personal choice and setting boundaries, but from a broader perspective, his reasoning might be seen as judgmental or sexist. The answer hinges on whether society views such personal boundaries as acceptable or not. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering that personal boundaries are valid unless they harm others, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But there's a counterargument about societal expectations and potential sexism.\n"
