She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThey were casually dating a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with twelve guys on their college football team. When she wanted to take it seriously, he said no because of two reasons: he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends, and he doesn't want a relationship where she's after athletes. The mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, and he's confused because he thinks if he were into guys, the same logic would apply. He also mentions the potential drama and being roasted, so he's looking for validation if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. The person set boundaries, which is okay, but the reasonings might be problematic. Let's break down his reasons:\n\n1. He doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends. The analogy is \"don't shit where you eat.\" This is a personal boundary, but is it fair? People have different standards. However, judging someone solely on their sexual history can be seen as judgmental or even discriminatory. It might be a form of double standard if he wouldn't mind if the roles were reversed (though he claims he would have the same reaction). But if it's a personal choice, maybe it's not the worst, but it could be seen as shallow.\n\n2. He's worried about dating a \"ball bunny\" because he might go pro. This could be a stereotype or prejudice against women who are interested in athletes. It's possible that he's generalizing all such women as only after the athletes for their success rather than the person themselves. This could be a form of sexism if he's assuming all women in that situation are like that, rather than judging the individual.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction as calling him a sexist asshole might be a valid point. If he's using her sexual history as a reason, that could be seen as holding her to a standard he wouldn't for a man. The \"if the roles were reversed\" argument is important here. If he were a woman and this was about a man's sexual history, would he make the same decision? If yes, maybe it's not sexist. But if he wouldn't, then it is.\n\nHe argues that if the genders were switched, his reasoning would be the same. But is that true? If a guy slept with many of his friends, would he date him? That's a key question. If he wouldn't, then his reasoning is sexist. If he would, then maybe not. The problem is that the way he's phrasing it now might imply a double standard.\n\nAlso, the idea of avoiding drama and potential insecurities is valid, but using her past as a reason could ignore her character. The woman in question is described as nice and attractive, so maybe the issue is more about societal expectations than the actual person.\n\nIn terms of ethics, being honest is important. He did tell her the reason after being confronted, which is fair. But making a decision based on her past relationships without considering her current feelings or the context might be judgmental. Also, the term \"ball bunny\" is a derogatory term that can dehumanize women and imply they're only interested in athletes for superficial reasons. Using such terms reflects a negative stereotype.\n\nSo, putting it all together: If his reasons are based on personal boundaries and he's consistent in applying those boundaries regardless of gender, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's applying a different standard to women than men or using stereotypes, then he might be in the wrong. The mutual friend's reaction might be valid if the reasoning is indeed sexist. The key is whether his decision is based on a valid personal boundary or a harmful stereotype. Since he claims the same standard would apply if genders were reversed, but we can't know for sure unless he's consistent, the answer hinges on that. If he's treating both genders equally, then it's a personal choice. If not, then it's wrong. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given the context, there's a case to be made that he's enforcing a double standard, especially considering the use of a derogatory term and the stereotypes involved. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because the reasoning could be based on sexist assumptions rather than the actual person's character.\n"
