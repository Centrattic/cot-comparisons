She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history with his college football teammates. The author's reasons are about boundaries and not wanting a relationship that could lead to drama or being seen as a \"ball bunny.\" \n\nFirst, the author mentions a personal boundary: not dating someone who's slept with his friends. That's a personal choice, but is it wrong? It might come off as judgmental or hypocritical if he's not consistent. He also says he doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes, which he calls his \"worst nightmare.\" That seems like a personal preference, but using someone's sexual history as a dealbreaker could be problematic.\n\nThe girl was hurt when he rejected her, and a mutual friend called him sexist. The author argues that if the genders were reversed, he'd feel the same. But the issue here is that he's making a judgment based on her sexual history, which is a classic example of sexism. Even if he's honest, it's still a biased reason to reject someone. The fact that she's been with teammates is one thing, but the number (12) might not be relevant unless there's infidelity involved. The author is projecting his own insecurities onto her, which isn't fair to her.\n\nAlso, the mutual friend's reaction suggests that others might see this as sexist. The author's reasoning is based on stereotypes about women who date athletes. He's avoiding potential drama, but that's more about his own comfort than her actions. So, while he's being honest, the underlying reasons are problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's letting his personal biases and insecurities dictate his decision in a way that's discriminatory.\n"
