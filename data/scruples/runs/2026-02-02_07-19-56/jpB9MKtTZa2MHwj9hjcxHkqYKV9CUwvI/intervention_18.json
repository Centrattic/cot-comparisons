She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The key points are that he was seeing a girl for two months, she had slept with 12 guys from his college football team, and he decided not to date her because of that. His reasons were two-fold: not wanting to date someone who's slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and not wanting a relationship with someone who \"goes after athletes\" because he might go pro. The girl was hurt, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if his reasoning is valid. He's stating personal boundaries, which is generally okay. People have the right to set their own criteria for relationships. However, the way he framed it might be problematic. Saying he doesn't date girls who slept with his friends could be seen as a double standard if he were a woman in this scenario. Also, judging someone based on their sexual history, especially in a society where there's movement towards more acceptance and less stigma around sex, might be viewed as hypocritical or sexist, even if he claims it's about boundaries. \n\nThe second reason, avoiding \"ball bunnies,\" could be seen as stereotyping women who are interested in athletes. This might come off as sexist because he's making assumptions about her intentions based on her past relationships. Even if his own preferences are clear, dismissing someone for that reason could be seen as unfair or biased.\n\nHe also didn't want to deal with potential insecurity or jokes from others, which is a personal choice, but using that as a justification might not hold up if others see it as him being insecure or not respecting her autonomy. The mutual friend's reaction is another point\u2014calling him a sexist asshole might be an overreaction, but there's merit if his reasons are based on stereotypes rather than actual issues with the girl's behavior towards him.\n\nSo, while he's not necessarily \"in the wrong\" in a legal or ethical sense for not wanting to date her, his reasoning might be considered sexist or judgmental, especially if it's based on outdated norms or stereotypes. The key here is whether his reasons are valid personal boundaries or if they're discriminatory. Since he's applying his own standards, it's a personal choice, but the way he's framing it (especially the part about avoiding \"ball bunnies\") could be seen as him being the asshole for making snap judgments based on her past without considering her character beyond that.\n"
