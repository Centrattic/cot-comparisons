She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's breaking things off with a girl he was casually dating because she's slept with many of his teammates and he doesn't want to date someone he perceives as a \"ball bunny.\" He's being called a sexist asshole by a mutual friend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The guy cites two main reasons: his boundary about not dating someone who's slept with his friends, and not wanting a relationship with someone chasing athletes. The girl was hurt when he revealed the first reason, and the friend is upset, calling him sexist.\n\nIs it wrong to have personal boundaries? People have different values and comfort levels. If he's clear that he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends, that's his choice. However, the way he handled it might be an issue. He didn't want to tell her the real reason at first but then confirmed it when she asked, which could have been more sensitive.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone associated with athletes. That could be seen as a personal preference but might also imply a stereotype or judgment about women who are interested in athletes. The friend's reaction is that this is sexist because if the roles were reversed, the guy wouldn't be judged the same way. That's a valid point. The guy argues that if the girl were a guy, his reaction would be the same, but in reality, the situation isn't symmetrical. Men and women are often judged differently when it comes to their romantic histories.\n\nAlso, the potential for insecurity and team dynamics is a practical concern. If they were in a relationship, it could lead to tension with teammates, which he's trying to avoid. But is that a fair reason to end a relationship? It's a personal boundary, but it might also be a form of gatekeeping or double standards.\n\nThe key here is whether the guy's reasoning is justified. He's being honest about his boundaries, but the friend's accusation of sexism is worth considering. If he's applying a different standard based on gender, that's problematic. However, he claims he would apply the same standard if the genders were swapped. That part is debatable because societal expectations often differ for men and women in such contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, while the guy has the right to set his own boundaries, the reasons he's using might be based on stereotypes or double standards. The mutual friend's reaction highlights the potential for sexism in his reasoning, even if he doesn't intend it. So, there's a case to be made that he's in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
