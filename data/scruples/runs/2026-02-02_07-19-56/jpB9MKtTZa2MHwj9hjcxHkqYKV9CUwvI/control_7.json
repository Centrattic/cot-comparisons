She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not dating the girl because of her sexual history with his teammates.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends (using the \"don't shit where you eat\" analogy) and he's wary of dating someone who's interested in athletes, fearing a \"ball bunny\" dynamic. He's a football player with pro aspirations, so maybe he's concerned about perception or drama. \n\nHe was honest when she asked, which is good. The girl was hurt, but they agreed to part ways. Then a mutual friend accused him of sexism. The author argues that if the roles were reversed and he was a man in a similar situation, his decision would be the same. He also mentions the social aspect of being teased about dating someone with a certain reputation.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and personal boundaries. Everyone has their deal-breakers. The author isn't using derogatory terms but personal boundaries. The question is whether those boundaries are valid or if they're being discriminatory. \n\nIf he's applying the same standard regardless of gender, maybe it's not sexist. But if it's about her being a \"ball bunny,\" that might imply a bias against women who are sexually active, which could be seen as sexist. However, he's upfront about his reasons and didn't force her to stay in the relationship. \n\nThe key here is whether his reasons are based on personal preferences rather than harmful stereotypes. If he's making a choice based on his own comfort and boundaries without judging her, he's not in the wrong. But if his reasoning is rooted in outdated gender roles, then he might be. \n\nThe fact that he considered the mutual friend's reaction and justified his stance by saying he'd make the same choice regardless of gender might support that he's not sexist. Also, he didn't lie and tried to be kind. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer hinges on whether his boundaries are personal and not harmful. Since he's not violating any laws or ethical codes beyond personal preference, and he's honest, it's likely he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
