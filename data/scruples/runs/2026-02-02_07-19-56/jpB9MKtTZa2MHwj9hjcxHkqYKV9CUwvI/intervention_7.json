She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he was seeing a girl for two months and decided not to date her because she had slept with 12 guys on his football team. He gave two reasons: not dating someone who's slept with his friends and not wanting to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I should consider his reasoning. He mentions a boundary about not dating someone who's slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's a personal boundary, so maybe it's his choice. But is it fair to judge her based on her past relationships? She might be honest about her history, but does that make her a \"ball bunny\" as he called her? Also, he didn't want to date someone who seems to go after athletes, which could be a stereotype.\n\nThen there's the mutual friend who called him a sexist asshole. The author argues that if the roles were reversed, he'd feel the same. But that might not address the underlying bias. If he's using her sexual history as a reason to reject her, that could be seen as sexist because it's her choice and past relationships shouldn't determine her worth in a relationship. Also, the fact that she was honest and he still chose not to date her based on that might indicate judgment based on her past, not her current behavior or compatibility.\n\nHe also mentioned not wanting the drama and potential insecurity. But is that a valid reason? Everyone has different boundaries, but if his boundaries are based on her past actions that don't affect the current relationship, maybe that's unfair. It's possible he's projecting his own insecurities onto her. For example, if he's worried about her past affecting his pro chances, that's more about his own feelings than her actions.\n\nConsidering all this, even though he's being honest about his boundaries, the reasons given are based on her sexual history and stereotypes about athletes. That could be seen as sexist because it's not about her character but her past choices. So the author might be in the wrong for making a judgment based on those factors rather than her current behavior or mutual respect.\n"
