She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not dating the girl because of her sexual history and her connections to the football team. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the two main reasons given. The first is that he doesn't date girls who've slept with his friends. That's a personal boundary, so maybe it's his right to set that. But is it fair to the girl? She might not have known that was a dealbreaker for him. Also, the comparison to \"don't shit where you eat\" could imply a double standard, but he's explaining his own boundaries.\n\nThe second reason is about her dating athletes, fearing she's a \"ball bunny.\" That seems more like a stereotype. He's worried about her intentions based on her past, which might be unfair. The mutual friend called him sexist, so there's a perspective that he's making a judgment based on gender. But he argues that if the genders were reversed, he'd still have the same stance, which complicates that point.\n\nHe didn't want to tell her the real reasons, but when she guessed correctly, he confirmed it. She was hurt, which suggests that his rejection might have been a bit abrupt. However, he did clarify that he thought she was a cool person, so it's about compatibility, not just dislike.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries. But if the reason is based on stereotypes or could be considered discriminatory, then maybe he's in the wrong. The key points are whether his reasons are legitimate and if they unfairly target the girl. \n\nIf his boundaries are personal and not based on prejudice, then he's not wrong. But if he's making assumptions about her character based on her history, that's a problem. The fact that he's a football player might mean that his team's dynamics are important to him, so avoiding drama is understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's setting his own boundaries, even if others might criticize them. But there's a nuance here about potential sexism. However, the mutual friend's reaction might be overreacting. The answer depends on whether the reasons are personal and non-discriminatory. Since he framed it as his personal boundaries and not a judgment on her character, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
