She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who declined to date a girl because she had slept with multiple guys on his college football team. The guy gives two main reasons: his boundary about not dating someone who's slept with his friends, and his aversion to dating someone who seems to target athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The guy is making a personal choice based on his own boundaries. That part is his right. People have different values and deal-breakers. However, the issue might be in how he communicated it. He didn't initially tell her the real reason but admitted to it when she guessed. The mutual friend called him sexist, which might imply that there's a perception of double standards. If he would react the same way if the situation were reversed with genders, then maybe it's not sexist. But societal norms often judge women more harshly for their sexual history compared to men, so even if he's consistent, his reasoning could be influenced by societal biases rather than the woman's character.\n\nAlso, the girl's actions don't inherently harm him unless he's uncomfortable. She's not doing anything illegal or unethical; personal choices about relationships are usually personal. So, while he's not obligated to date her, his reasoning might be based on prejudice. The mutual friend's anger suggests that others see his reaction as unfair. The question is whether his reasons are valid enough to exonerate him from being wrong. Since he's making a choice that's his right, but the way it's framed could be seen as discriminatory, it's a bit of a gray area. But since he's not forcing his opinion on others and is honest (even if he was a bit evasive at first), maybe he's not in the wrong. So leaning towards B, but need to be cautious. The mutual friend's accusation of sexism is a point against him. However, the guy claims he'd have the same standard if roles were reversed, which might mitigate that. Overall, I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because he's acting on personal boundaries, even if others disagree.\n"
