She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history. The scenario involves a guy who was casually dating a girl but decided against a serious relationship after learning she had slept with multiple teammates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the author's reasoning. His first reason is about not dating someone who's had relationships with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" The second reason is about avoiding relationships with people who target athletes, fearing it's a \"ball bunny\" situation. \n\nNow, looking at societal norms and ethics. People have different boundaries, and it's generally acceptable to have personal reasons for declining a relationship. However, the question is whether those reasons are justified or discriminatory. The author's first reason is about personal boundaries, which is a common stance many people have. The second reason might be seen as problematic because it's a stereotype against women who are attracted to athletes, which could be considered sexist.\n\nThe mutual friend called him a sexist asshole, which adds another layer. The friend's anger might stem from perceiving the author's judgment based on the girl's sexual history rather than her character. The author argues that his reasoning is the same regardless of gender, but the scenario is specific to a female in a male-dominated environment (football team), which might imply a bias.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives: There's no law against having personal preferences in dating. However, if the behavior is based on harmful stereotypes or prejudices, it could be ethically questionable. The author is using the girl's sexual history as a deal-breaker, which can be seen as judgmental. Society is increasingly moving towards valuing people's choices and not judging them for their past relationships or sexual history.\n\nAlso, the author's concern about being roasted or having insecurities might reflect his own biases rather than an objective reason. The girl's actions with teammates don't inherently affect his ability to have a relationship with her unless he's projecting his own insecurities onto the situation.\n\nConsidering consent and autonomy: The girl had the right to sleep with whomever she chose, and the author is making a decision based on that, which is his right. However, judging someone for their sexual history can perpetuate stigma and double standards, especially when it's common but often criticized for women more than men in many societies.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction might be valid if the author's reasoning is based on sexist assumptions. By saying he wouldn't date someone based on their partners if it were a man, but in reality, the context here is different because it's a female in a male team setting. That could indicate a gendered double standard.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to set his own boundaries, his reasons might be ethically questionable due to potential sexism and judgment based on stereotypes. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for acting on those biases.\n"
