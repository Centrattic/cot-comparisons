She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they were casually seeing a girl for two months, but then they declined to go into a serious relationship because she had slept with 12 guys from their college football team. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for that decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the two main reasons the author gave. The first is about boundaries\u2014comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" implying that sleeping with friends creates drama. The second reason is about not wanting to date someone who goes after athletes, especially since the author is aiming to go pro and is concerned about being called a \"ball bunny.\"\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, is it wrong to have such boundaries? Well, people have different values and preferences in relationships. If the author is comfortable setting a boundary that they don't date people who've slept with their friends, that's their right. But the problem might be how that boundary is applied. The fact that she slept with 12 guys on the team\u2014does that automatically disqualify her for the author, or is it a personal choice based on his feelings?\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who's a \"ball bunny.\" But if the girl was dating athletes before the author even met her, and the author is an athlete himself, then maybe she's just interested in dating athletes, which isn't necessarily the girl's fault unless she was being deceitful. The author might have personal reservations about being in a relationship where they feel like they're being chosen over others, but is that a valid reason to refuse a relationship? It's a bit of a red flag if the author is more concerned about their teammates' reactions (the \"roasted\" part) than the girl's feelings or the relationship itself.\n\nAlso, the mutual friend who got angry at the author might think he's being sexist. Is the author being sexist here? If the same criteria applied to a guy, would the friend still be upset? The author says they'd give the same answer if the genders were reversed, but in reality, people might react differently. However, gender bias is a consideration here. The author is making a judgment based on the girl's sexual history, which could be seen as unfair since the girl's past relationships are her own business and don't directly affect the current relationship unless she's being unfaithful or not transparent.\n\nAnother angle: the author was in a casual relationship with her, so maybe the girl's history wasn't a factor until she wanted to take it further. The author might feel uncomfortable moving from casual to serious because of the existing relationships, but the girl might not have known about that boundary. Is it the author's responsibility to communicate that earlier? If they had known from the start, maybe they should have addressed it. But they were in a casual phase, so perhaps the boundary became important later.\n\nThe author's concern about their own potential insecurity and the team's reactions could be valid, but it's also about their own emotional state rather than the girl's actions. The girl isn't doing anything that's necessarily harmful unless the author's team found out and it caused actual problems. Since they were in a casual relationship, maybe the author's decision is just about their own comfort level.\n\nIn terms of general principles, everyone has the right to set their own relationship boundaries. However, making a decision based on someone's past sexual partners can be seen as judgmental, especially if it's a large number. The question is whether that's a fair or justifiable reason. Some might argue that it's a personal choice, while others might see it as limiting the girl's autonomy in her relationships.\n\nThe mutual friend's reaction might stem from the perception that the author is holding the girl to a standard that's not applied to himself or others. If the author is an athlete, perhaps the team has a different dynamic where such relationships are more common or accepted. The friend might believe the author is being hypocritical or unfair by rejecting the girl for something that's not her fault and that he should accept it as part of the college athlete culture.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not necessarily in the wrong if they are honest about their boundaries. However, if the boundary is based on outdated or sexist assumptions about women's sexual behavior, that could be problematic. The key is whether the author's reasons are valid for them personally or if they are imposing unnecessary judgment. Since the author was upfront about their reasoning and the girl understood it's a boundary issue, it's more about personal choice. But the question is whether that boundary is a justifiable one. If the author is focusing on his own insecurities rather than the girl's actions, he might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if it's a genuine boundary that he's always had, then it's his right to choose not to date her. The mutual friend's anger could be misplaced if the author is just being honest, but maybe the friend felt the author was being overly critical without considering the girl's perspective.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the boundary is reasonable and how the situation is framed. The author's reasons are personal and about their comfort, so unless he's being discriminatory, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the boundary is a reaction to the girl's choices rather than her actions affecting their relationship, that's where the debate lies. The fact that the author is an athlete and the girl's history with other athletes might be part of a broader cultural issue where athletes might feel their relationships are under more scrutiny. The mutual friend's anger toward the author for being a \"sexist asshole\" suggests that the friend might not support such a boundary, but the author's own justification is about personal boundaries and not wanting to deal with potential drama or insecurities.\n\nIn conclusion, if the author is being honest and setting clear boundaries without being discriminatory, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the boundary is based on unfair stereotypes or double standards, then he might be. Since the author compared it to a same-sex scenario and said he'd act the same, maybe he's not being sexist, but it's still a judgment on the girl's past. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his boundaries, but others might disagree based on different values.\n"
