She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author ending a relationship with a girl who had slept with many of his teammates.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a casual relationship with the girl for two months. He decided not to take it seriously because she'd slept with 12 guys on his college football team. His reasons are: 1) He doesn't date people who've slept with his friends, and 2) He doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes, as he has a chance of going pro.\n\nHe didn't want to hurt her feelings, but when she guessed the reason, he confirmed it. She was hurt, and a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. The author argues that if he were into guys and the girl was a guy, he'd still make the same choice. Also, he's concerned about being teased and potential insecurity.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So, is the author in the wrong (A) or not (B)?\n\nLet me consider the ethics here. Making a decision based on someone's sexual history can be problematic. It might be a personal preference, but can it be considered sexist? The author's first point is about not dating someone who slept with his friends. Is that a reasonable boundary? Maybe he's uncomfortable with the idea of being in a relationship with someone he's friends with other people he's been intimate with. That could be a personal choice, but it's also a bit of a social judgment.\n\nThe second reason is about not wanting to date someone who targets athletes because of his career. That's another personal preference. However, there's a double standard here. If the girl was into athletes, but the author is into her, it's a mutual attraction. But if the author is making a judgment based on her past relationships with athletes, is that fair? He might be making assumptions about her intentions.\n\nThe friend calling him sexist: is that justified? If the author is dismissing her based on her past relationships, that could be seen as sexist because it's judging her for something that's none of his business. However, if he's stating it's a boundary he's set for himself, it's more about personal preferences rather than a judgment on her. But the line between personal boundaries and prejudice can be thin.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that if the scenario were reversed (he were into guys and she were a guy), he'd still make the same choice. That suggests he's not basing it on gender but on the situation. However, the fact that he's judging her sexual history at all might still be problematic, as it's a personal choice she makes.\n\nIn relationships, people have different values and boundaries. If the author is honest and upfront, even if it's a reason that others might criticize, it's his choice. But if he's making a judgment that's harmful or discriminatory, then he could be in the wrong. The key here is whether his reasoning is a personal preference or a biased judgment.\n\nThe girl was hurt, which is expected in breakups. The mutual friend's reaction might be because the author judged her based on her sexuality, which can be seen as unfair. However, the author's own stance is that he's setting clear boundaries, which is his right. The question is whether those boundaries are reasonable or not.\n\nIn summary, while the author is making a personal choice based on his preferences, there's an argument that judging someone's past sexual relationships is a form of prejudice. Therefore, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) if the judgment is seen as sexist, or B (not in the wrong) if it's a personal boundary. The line is blurry, but many might argue that such judgments are problematic, hence A.\n"
