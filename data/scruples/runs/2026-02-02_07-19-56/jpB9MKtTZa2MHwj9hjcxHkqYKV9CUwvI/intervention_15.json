She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was casually dating a girl for two months and then decided not to date her seriously because she had slept with 12 guys from his college football team. The main reasons given are that he doesn't date people who have slept with his friends (comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat\") and he doesn't want to date someone who pursues athletes, as he has a chance to go pro.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's decision is based on personal boundaries, which is understandable. However, the question is whether that makes him the asshole. The girl in question hasn't done anything illegal or necessarily harmful; she's being honest about her sexual history. The author's reasons might reflect personal biases. The first point about not dating someone who slept with friends could be seen as judgmental or restrictive. The second reason about \"ball bunnies\" might carry a negative stereotype, implying that women who are attracted to athletes are not serious or are only interested in the athlete's status, which could be sexist.\n\nThe friend who called the author a sexist asshole might be right in pointing out that the author is setting a double standard. If the roles were reversed and the girl had similar preferences, would the author handle it the same way? The author claims he would, but that might not address underlying biases. Also, the author didn't want to explain the real reasons, which could be a way to avoid taking responsibility for his own prejudices.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is clear about his boundaries and communicated them, even if he didn't share the full reasoning. The girl was hurt, but it's a mutual decision to part ways. The author isn't forcing the relationship; he's choosing not to pursue it based on his values. However, the issue is whether his reasons are valid or if they perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people have different standards for relationships. But when those standards involve making judgments about someone's past without them doing anything wrong, it can be seen as problematic. The author's stance might be seen as more about his own comfort and external pressures (like being roasted by others) rather than the girl's actions towards him. The fact that his friend reacted negatively as sexist suggests that his reasoning could be viewed as such.\n\nSo, balancing personal choice with potential judgmental behavior. The key here is whether the author's reasons are based on valid personal boundaries or if they're discriminatory. The answer hinges on whether setting such boundaries is acceptable or if it's an example of the asshole behavior described in the AITA context.\n"
