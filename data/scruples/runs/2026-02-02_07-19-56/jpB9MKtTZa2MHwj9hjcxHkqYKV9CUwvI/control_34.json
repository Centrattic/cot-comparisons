She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he was casually seeing a girl for two months, and then he decided not to date her because she had slept with a bunch of guys on his football team. He gave two reasons: first, he doesn't date people who have slept with his friends, comparing it to \"don't shit where you eat,\" and second, he doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes because he might go pro and doesn't want a \"ball bunny.\" \n\nHmm. First, I need to consider if his reasons are valid. The first reason is about his personal boundaries. He says he doesn't want unnecessary drama. But is that a fair reason? Well, people have different boundaries, so maybe it's his prerogative to set that. However, is it acceptable to judge someone's past based on their sexual history? It's a bit of a sensitive topic. Some might argue that her past doesn't affect his current relationship, unless it's something that directly impacts their relationship now. \n\nThe second reason is about her being attracted to athletes. He's worried she's a \"ball bunny,\" which might be a stereotype. Maybe he's making an assumption here. Just because she's been with athletes doesn't mean she's only interested in them for their status. It might be a personal bias on his part. \n\nHe also mentions that a mutual friend called him a sexist asshole. That's a strong accusation. Is there a double standard here? He says if the roles were reversed and he was into guys, his answer would be the same. But in reality, when people make decisions based on a partner's sexual history, it often comes from a place of judgment or insecurity. The comparison to \"don't shit where you eat\" is interesting. It's like he's avoiding something he considers unclean or uncomfortable. \n\nAnother angle: consent and respect. The girl was being honest about her past, and he was the one who ended it. But by not dating her because of her past actions that don't involve him, is he respecting her autonomy? It's her life, and unless she's doing something harmful, her past relationships are her own. \n\nThe mutual friend's anger suggests that some people find his reasoning sexist. The friend might be arguing that judging someone's worth based on their sexual history is unfair. The author's defense that he would have the same stance if the roles were reversed might not hold water because if he were a woman in this scenario, the reasoning would still be about her past actions. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether his actions were unjust. He's allowed to have personal boundaries, but if those boundaries are based on discriminatory or sexist views, then he might be in the wrong. The key is whether his reasons are valid personal preferences or harmful judgments. \n\nSo, AITA? The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because his reasons might be based on stereotypes and judgment of her past, which isn't his business. But B (not in the wrong) could argue it's his right to set boundaries. However, societal expectations often frown upon judging others' past sexual behavior, especially when it doesn't affect the relationship. The mutual friend's reaction and the potential sexism in his reasoning suggest that A might be the answer. But it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the community often sides with personal choice in boundaries, but if the reasoning is sexist, then it's a problem. The term \"ball bunny\" is a stereotype, so that part is definitely a red flag. His first reason is about avoiding drama, which is valid, but the second is more about her intentions, which he's assuming without clear evidence. \n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards A because the reasons given have elements that could be considered sexist or judgmental, especially the \"ball bunny\" part. He's making a decision based on her past actions that don't directly affect their current relationship, which could be seen as unfair.\n"
