She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the author was casually dating a girl for two months. She's nice and attractive, but she's slept with 12 guys on his college football team. He refused to take it seriously because he has boundaries against dating someone who's slept with his friends and also doesn't want to date someone who goes after athletes. When she asked, he said yes, it was about her sleeping with teammates. She got hurt, they parted ways, and a mutual friend accused him of being sexist. The author is confused because he thinks if roles were reversed, he'd make the same choice.\n\nI need to decide if he's in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. \n\n1. **Personal Boundaries**: The author states that he doesn't date people who've slept with his friends. He compares it to \"don't shit where you eat.\" That's his personal choice, right? People have different boundaries, and as long as he's honest, it's his right to decide who he dates. But does that make him sexist? If he had the same standards regardless of gender, maybe not. But the mutual friend called him sexist, implying maybe the issue is with her being a woman and his judgment about her behavior.\n\n2. **Preferences vs. Prejudice**: He doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes because of his pro football aspirations. That's a personal preference. However, if he's judging her based on stereotypes (like \"ball bunnies\") rather than her actual character, it might be problematic. The question is whether his reasons are valid or if they stem from assumptions about women.\n\n3. **Honesty and Communication**: He didn't initially want to tell her his reasons but ended up confirming her suspicion. While he was honest in the end, maybe he could have been more empathetic. However, she asked directly, so he answered. He also tried to be kind, saying she's cool but it's a mismatch.\n\n4. **Friend's Reaction**: The mutual friend's anger suggests that society might view this as sexist, but the author argues that if the genders were reversed, his stance would be the same. That's a point in his favor if he's being consistent, but maybe the friend thought it's different because it's a woman.\n\n5. **Potential for Drama**: He mentions avoiding unnecessary drama and insecurities. These are valid concerns for him personally. However, using someone's past relationships (which are none of his business unless they're ongoing) as a deal-breaker could be seen as holding her to a standard that's not fair, especially if he wouldn't hold a male partner to the same.\n\n6. **Stereotyping**: The term \"ball bunny\" is a stereotype, which can be derogatory. Using such a term might contribute to the perception of sexism. His reasoning about her targeting athletes could be based on a stereotype rather than her actual actions.\n\n7. **Consistency**: If he's applying the same standards to men and women, then it's his preference. But if he's applying different standards (e.g., if he wouldn't judge a male partner for sleeping with female athletes), then it could be sexist.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on personal boundaries and preferences. However, the way he frames his reasons and the stereotypes he uses might make it seem like he's in the wrong from a societal perspective, even if he's consistent in his standards. The mutual friend's reaction and the potential for his reasoning to be based on stereotypes (rather than her actual behavior) could mean he's overstepping. On the other hand, he's being honest about his limits, which is his right. But the key issue is whether his standards are fair or biased. Given that the question is whether he's in the wrong, if his reasons are based on prejudice or unrealistic expectations, then he might be in the wrong. But if it's just his personal preferences, he's not. The line between personal choice and prejudice is thin here.\n"
