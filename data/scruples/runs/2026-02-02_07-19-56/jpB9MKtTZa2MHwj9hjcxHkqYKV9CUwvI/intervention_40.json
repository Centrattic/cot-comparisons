She's a nice person and really attractive, but she had slept with at least 12 guys that are on my college football team, of which I am a part of. She recently asked if I wanted to try actually dating. I refused. My reasoning was as follows: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I don't date girls who have slept with people I am friends with. Thats a boundary I have always had. To me it's the same principle of \"don't shit where you eat\". I don't want the unnecessary drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) I don't date girls that seem to go after athletes. I have a realistic shot at going pro and getting into a relationship with a ball bunny is literally my worst nightmare. No thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to tell her why but as soon as I said no she said \"is it because I slept with a bunch of the dudes on your team?\". Me being kind of on the spot, I said yeah. She was obviously hurt and I did my best to make it clear that I thought she was a really cool person, it was just a mismatch of boundaries. We agreed to part ways and not continue to hang out. A little while late a mutual friend (who I think has feelings for her) blew up at me and called me a sexist asshole. I really don't get it? Like if I was into dudes and this girl was a dude I was sleeping with then my answer would have been the exact same thing. Plus like dating a girl with a reputation on a football team is just asking to be roasted about it. I'd rather not deal with the chirps or the potential insecurity. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Girl I was seeing has been around the locker room a bit. That made me decide I didn't want to pursue a serious relationship. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not dating a girl because of her sexual history. The situation is that the girl in question has slept with a bunch of guys on the author's college football team, and he refuses to date her because of two main reasons: 1) he doesn't date girls who have slept with his friends, and 2) he doesn't want to date someone who targets athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a judgment based on the girl's sexual history, which could be seen as hypocritical if he has a similar history. However, the user mentions that the author is a football player, and athletes might have different social dynamics. Also, the author's reasoning includes not wanting drama and not wanting to date someone who's a \"ball bunny,\" which is a common stereotype but not a valid reason to judge someone's worth.\n\nAnother angle is the mutual friend's reaction. The friend accused the author of sexism, which could be a point to consider. If the author had the same judgment about men, it might be different, but the scenario is specific to the girl's actions. The author claims it's about boundaries and avoiding drama, which are personal choices, but using someone else's sexual history as a dealbreaker can be problematic because it's a personal choice and not a reflection of the person's character.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reasons are valid. If he's being honest about his boundaries, then he's not necessarily wrong for making that choice. However, if he's making a judgment based on stereotypes or double standards, then he might be in the wrong. The fact that he was honest and didn't try to hide his reasons is a positive, but the reasons themselves are based on personal preferences rather than objective wrongdoing by the girl.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision is his prerogative, the way he framed his reasons might imply judgment without considering the girl's autonomy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for holding that boundary, especially if it's not reciprocal.\n"
