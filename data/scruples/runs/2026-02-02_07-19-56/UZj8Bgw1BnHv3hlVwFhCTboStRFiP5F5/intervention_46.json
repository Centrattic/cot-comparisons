We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to unpack the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and the author live together and have his son every other week. They've been together for a few months, but the author has been part of the boyfriend's life for two years. So there's some established relationship there. The key event is that when the boyfriend was out, his son came onto the couch, lay on her chest, and fell asleep. The author didn't stop this, even though the son had been reserved about cuddling before. When the boyfriend found out, he freaked out, saying it was inappropriate and that she should have said no. The author defended herself by saying she didn't push for cuddling and was actually happy about the moment.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. The main issue here seems to be about the mother-son dynamic. The author is a girlfriend, not the mother, so she's in a parental role with the stepchild. Allowing the child to cuddle might be seen as crossing a line, depending on the family's norms. The boyfriend's reaction is based on the idea that it looks weird or inappropriate, possibly because it could imply an inappropriate relationship or at least create discomfort. The author's defense is that she didn't push it, but she allowed it. \n\nBut wait, the son initiated the cuddling. The author didn't push for it, but she let it happen. Is that wrong? From a step-parent perspective, maintaining appropriate boundaries is crucial. Even if the child initiated it, allowing physical intimacy that a parent might not be comfortable with could be a problem. The boyfriend's reaction is about boundaries and how others might perceive it, which is valid. The author might not have malicious intent, but the action still caused a conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to build a relationship with the child, and the child seems to trust her. The cuddling might be a natural expression of that bond. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is significant here. The key question is whether the author overstepped by allowing physical contact that the boyfriend finds inappropriate. Since the boyfriend explicitly said it looks weird and he's uncomfortable, respecting his feelings is part of a healthy relationship. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, might have disregarded his boundaries without considering his perspective. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It could depend on cultural context or specific family norms, but generally, maintaining appropriate boundaries with stepchildren is important. The author allowed a situation that the boyfriend found problematic, even if the child initiated it. She might not have intended to cross a line, but by not addressing it when she noticed the boyfriend's discomfort later, she could be at fault. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes, she's in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing nuances. The boyfriend's reaction being over the top versus a valid concern is a gray area, but from a relational standpoint, respecting his boundaries is key. So, Answer A.\n"
