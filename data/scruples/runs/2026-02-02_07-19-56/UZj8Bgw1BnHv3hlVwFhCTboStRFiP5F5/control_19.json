We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author allowing the boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her while the boyfriend was away. The boyfriend later got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and her boyfriend live together and have the boy every other week. She's been part of his life for two years. The son was sitting on the floor, then crawled up to the couch with her. He's been reserved about cuddling with her, and she didn't push it. She let him stay until the boyfriend came home. The boyfriend is upset, thinking it's inappropriate and \"looks weird.\"\n\nSo, key points: the son initiated the cuddling, the author didn't push for it, and she allowed it naturally. The boyfriend is upset about the appearance of it. Is the author in the wrong? Well, the son is a child, and the author is in a relationship with the father. Letting a child cuddle for comfort seems normal. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity. However, the author didn't do anything to harm the child or overstep. She respected the son's boundaries by not pushing for the cuddle. The main issue is the boyfriend's perception of impropriety. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, actions vs. perceptions matter. The author's action was a natural response to the child's need for comfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about how it looks rather than any wrongdoing. Unless there's a history of inappropriate behavior, the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
