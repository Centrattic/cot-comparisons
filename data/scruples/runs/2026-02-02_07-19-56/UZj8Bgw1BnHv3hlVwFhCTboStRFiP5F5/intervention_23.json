We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a boyfriend's son cuddling and falling asleep with the author. The author and her boyfriend live together and have the son every other week. She's been in his life for two years. The boyfriend got upset when the son cuddled with her, saying it looked weird and inappropriate, and she's asking if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The author is in a committed relationship with the boyfriend, which implies a certain level of trust and boundaries. The boyfriend's son is part of their shared life, and they're responsible for his care. The issue here is about physical boundaries between the partner and the child.\n\nCuddling is a form of affection that can be appropriate for children, especially when they're feeling safe or need comfort. If the son approached her and she allowed it, maybe she didn't overstep if she was just being a caring presence. However, the boyfriend is now upset because he finds it inappropriate. This could be due to personal values, cultural norms, or just how he feels about such interactions.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't initiate it; the son did. She was lying on the couch, and he came to her. She allowed it without pushing for closeness. So, her action might be seen as a natural response to a child seeking comfort. However, the boyfriend's reaction is valid if he's uncomfortable with the physical closeness, even if it's platonic. The key is whether the author's actions crossed a line that the boyfriend might have expected her to respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction might be overprotective or based on jealousy, even if he's not in an official parenting role. But the son is his child, so he might have a say in how his child interacts with others, especially the partner. The question is about whether the author should have said no. If the boyfriend is the parent, he might feel responsible for setting those boundaries, even if the other parent in the relationship is okay with it.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author didn't push for closeness and the son initiated it could mean she wasn't being inappropriate. But she might not have considered the boyfriend's potential feelings about the situation. Maybe she should have discussed boundaries about physical interactions with the child beforehand. But since the son is used to her being around and they spend time together every other week, maybe the cuddling isn't unusual.\n\nAnother angle: allowing a child to cuddle is usually okay, but if the boyfriend is the parent, he might have concerns about others being too affectionate. It's possible he wants to maintain certain boundaries to avoid any misinterpretation. The author might not be in the wrong if the interaction was innocent and the child was just seeking comfort. However, if the boyfriend's rules are part of their co-parenting agreement, then the author might be expected to follow them.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the action was within the boundaries both agreed upon. Since the boyfriend is the parent and he's upset, maybe the author should have anticipated that. But if the son is comfortable with her and it's a rare occurrence, it might not be the author's fault. The main point is that the boyfriend is now upset, and the author didn't know the boundaries were that strict. So, maybe she's not in the wrong, but there's a need for better communication moving forward.\n"
