We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a relationship with a boyfriend who has a son. They live together, and they have the son every other week. The boyfriend was out for a few hours, and during that time, the son came into the author's space. The author was on the couch, and the son crawled up and fell asleep on her. The boyfriend later got upset about it, thinking it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been part of the boyfriend's life for two years, which probably means they have some level of trust and familiarity. The son is with them every other week, so this is a regular arrangement. The author mentions that the son has been reserved about cuddling, so she didn't push it. She allowed the cuddling because the son initiated it, and she felt happy about it. That seems like a natural response when a child wants comfort.\n\nNow, the boyfriend got upset when he came back. He initially freaked out, then backtracked, saying it looked weird and inappropriate. The key here is whether the author did something wrong. The son initiated the cuddling, and the author allowed it. From a child's perspective, seeking comfort from someone they know and trust is normal, especially if they're close to their parent's partner. The author didn't push for the cuddling; it was the child's choice. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort or a misinterpretation of the situation. If the author was in a close relationship with the child, this kind of interaction is typical. However, the boyfriend might have boundaries he didn't communicate. But the question is, was the author wrong? The action was allowing the child to cuddle after the child initiated it. Unless there's a history of inappropriate behavior or specific boundaries the author was aware of, she wasn't in the wrong. The boyfriend should have communicated his concerns better instead of reacting negatively after the fact. \n\nAlso, the author didn't do anything to encourage the child beyond what was natural. The child might have felt safe and comfortable with the author, which is a good thing. The boyfriend's issue seems more about perception rather than actual wrongdoing. The author's response to let the child stay until he woke up wasn't harmful. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the child initiated the interaction, and she allowed it without overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction is about his own discomfort rather than the author's actions being inappropriate.\n"
