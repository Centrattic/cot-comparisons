We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle with her while the boyfriend was away. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The boyfriend and the author live together and have been in a relationship for a while, but they've only been living together for a few months. The son is 2 years old, and the author has been present in the boyfriend's life for two years. The incident happened when the boyfriend was out for a few hours. The son was on the couch with the author, and after some time, he crawled up and fell asleep with his head on her chest. The author let him stay until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend then got upset, saying it was inappropriate and that she should have said no.\n\nThe author is asking if she's at fault. The user initially thought she might be wrong but is unsure. So, what are the key points here? \n\nFirst, the son was a child. Letting a child of that age cuddle and fall asleep with an adult might not be inherently inappropriate, especially if the child was being affectionate. However, the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt uncomfortable or that it cross a line. \n\nBut wait, the boy was 2 years old. At that age, children often seek comfort from adults they're close to. If the author was acting as a caregiver or a stepmother figure, it's common for children to show affection that way. However, the boyfriend's concern might be about the appearance of something inappropriate. Maybe he's worried about how it looks, especially if they're not married or if there are legal or social boundaries they need to consider. \n\nBut the author is in a relationship with the father, so she's a part of the child's life. The issue here is consent and boundaries. The son initiated the cuddling, and the author allowed it. But was the author supposed to set boundaries even if the child didn't have any bad intentions? The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own discomfort or societal norms, not the child's actions. \n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's reaction. He \"freaked out\" and later backtracked when asked if he was accusing her of something. That might indicate his own insecurities or jealousy, rather than a genuine wrongdoing by the author. If the author was okay with it and the child was okay with it, maybe the issue is the boyfriend's overreaction. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the son was reserved in showing affection before, so allowing this cuddling might be a positive sign for the child's comfort level. But maybe the boyfriend's concern is about setting a precedent or how it looks if the child is in the care of someone else. \n\nHowever, the key here is whether the author did something wrong. Since the child is young and the cuddling was a natural form of affection, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the boyfriend felt it was inappropriate, maybe she should have respected his boundaries earlier, but since he wasn't present, she had no way of knowing. \n\nWait, but the author is already in a relationship with the father, so she's part of the child's life. Allowing the child to cuddle isn't necessarily wrong. Maybe the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own feelings or lack of communication about boundaries. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a difference between a child showing affection and an adult. A 2-year-old's behavior is different. So the author isn't at fault here. The boyfriend's issue seems more about his own discomfort or lack of communication. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
