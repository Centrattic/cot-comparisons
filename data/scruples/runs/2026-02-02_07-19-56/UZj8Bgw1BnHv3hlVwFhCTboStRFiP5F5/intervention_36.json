We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's with her boyfriend, they live together, and she's been part of his life for two years. They have his son every other week. The boyfriend left for a few hours, and his son was watching TV with her. She was on the couch, and the son was on the floor but then came up to lay on her chest and fell asleep. She let him stay until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend got upset, saying it was inappropriate and weird, and even accused her of something, but then backed off to just saying it looks bad and she should have said no.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The son is a child, so boundaries with minors are important. The boyfriend might be protective of his son and concerned about how others might perceive the situation. But the son initiated the cuddling and fell asleep. The author didn't push it; she allowed it because the child was comfortable. However, the boyfriend is upset that she didn't stop it. \n\nBut wait, the son is in their care every other week. The author has been present in his life for two years, so she's a regular part of his life. The son is reserved with her, so he's not someone she's overly familiar with. When the son initiates cuddling, maybe she felt it was okay since he did it. But the boyfriend's reaction is that it looks inappropriate. Is there a cultural or societal norm here? Letting a child sleep with an unrelated adult, even a partner's child, might be seen as crossing a line in some people's eyes. But others might see it as a natural response when a child is tired and seeks comfort.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction seems a bit harsh. He \"freaked out\" and later backtracked. Maybe his main concern is about perception. He's worried about how others might view the situation, or he feels uncomfortable with his son being close to his partner. But if the author is in a committed relationship, why is this an issue? The son is his responsibility, so the boyfriend might feel responsible for setting boundaries. However, the author didn't initiate the cuddling; the child did. She could have refused, but she allowed it because the child was comfortable.\n\nBut does allowing a child to cuddle and fall asleep on you count as being in the wrong? Maybe not if the intention was good and there was no misconduct. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid because he's the parent. The author might not have considered his feelings here. Even if the intention was innocent, respecting the boyfriend's boundaries as the parent is important. She might have overstepped by not checking with him first or by not stopping it when he wasn't there. But since he wasn't present, maybe she thought it was okay. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent should set the rules for their child's interactions, especially with others. The author allowed an action that the parent later disapproved of, even if the child initiated it. So in a way, she might have been wrong not to adhere to the boyfriend's unspoken expectations regarding his son's interactions. But if the boyfriend didn't specify any boundaries beforehand, maybe it's his fault for not communicating. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the boyfriend had set clear boundaries that the son shouldn't be alone with her, then she would be wrong. But since he didn't, and she allowed the son to cuddle because he initiated it, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, she should consider the parent's feelings and perhaps not let the child be in a position that the parent might find uncomfortable. \n\nHmm. I think the key points are: the son initiated the cuddling, the author didn't push it, but the parent later feels it was inappropriate. The author might not be in the wrong if the cuddling was innocent and the parent is being overly sensitive. But if the parent's concerns are about protecting his son's boundaries and perception, then maybe the author should have respected that. But since the parent wasn't there, maybe she couldn't have known. \n\nI'm leaning towards the answer being B (Not in the wrong) because the author didn't force the interaction; the child did it. But there's also a responsibility to consider the parent's feelings. However, without prior communication about boundaries, it's hard to say she's at fault. So maybe B is the right choice.\n"
