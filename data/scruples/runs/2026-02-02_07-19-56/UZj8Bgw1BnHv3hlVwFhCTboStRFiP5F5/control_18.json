We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for letting the boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, have the boy every other week. The boyfriend wasn't home for a few hours. The son moved from the floor to the couch to lie on her chest and fall asleep. The author didn't push for physical contact, just allowed it. The boyfriend got upset, saying it looked inappropriate.\n\nSo, the main points here are about boundaries, consent, and the boyfriend's reaction. The author didn't initiate the cuddling; the child did. She allowed it, which might be normal for a step-parent or caregiver. But the boyfriend feels it's inappropriate. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, she didn't force the situation. The child approached her. She didn't act inappropriately. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about discomfort with the situation, maybe jealousy or concerns about how it looks. However, the key is whether the author did something wrong. Since the child initiated and she didn't encourage anything beyond what the child wanted, she's probably not in the wrong. The issue might be more about the boyfriend's feelings and communication. She should have discussed it with him if there were boundaries, but since he wasn't present, maybe she wasn't wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
