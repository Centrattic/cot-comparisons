We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a relationship with a boyfriend, they live together, and they have his son every other week. The boyfriend was out, and the son and author were on the couch. The son crawled up and fell asleep with his head on her chest. When the boyfriend came back, he freaked out, calling it inappropriate and weird.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the boyfriend have been together for two years, living together for a few months. The son is 2 years old? Wait, the age isn't specified, but the fact that they have him every other week suggests maybe he's a child in the care of both the boyfriend and the author. If the son is a minor, then the situation might be about boundaries between a partner and their partner's child. \n\nThe key issue here is whether allowing a child to sleep in such a close physical position is inappropriate. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks it looks weird and inappropriate. The author didn't push for it; the child initiated it. The author is asking if she's at fault.\n\nNow, the possible angles: from a legal standpoint, if the child is a minor, any form of inappropriate touching could be a concern, but here it's a child falling asleep on someone. However, from a social or relational standpoint, a boyfriend might feel uncomfortable with his partner being in bed or on the couch with his son in a close position. There's a potential for jealousy or concerns about boundaries. \n\nBut the child was the one who crawled up and fell asleep. The author didn't initiate it. If the child is young, say under 10, it's more about a parent's concern about how the situation looks. However, if the child is older, maybe a teenager, that's different, but the scenario doesn't specify. \n\nIn most cases, unless there's a specific policy or cultural context where this is a big no-no, it's common for children to cuddle with people they trust. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort or perception rather than any actual harm. The author didn't force the child; she allowed him to stay until the boyfriend came back. \n\nBut the boyfriend is the parent, so he might have the right to set boundaries regarding his child's interactions. Even if the author didn't do anything wrong, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. However, if the author knew it would upset him, maybe she should have considered that. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if she allowed it without the parent's approval, perhaps there's a slight misstep, but the child initiated it. So maybe she's not at fault. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but she might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No."
