We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle with her and fall asleep. The scenario is that the boy was on the floor, then crawled up to the couch with the author. She allowed him to lie with his head on her chest, and he fell asleep. The boyfriend later got upset, saying it looked inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and her boyfriend live together and have the boy every other week. They've been together for a few months, but the author has been in the boy's life for two years. The boy is described as being reserved with cuddling, so the author didn't push him. The key points here are the age of the child, the relationship dynamics, and cultural norms.\n\nIf the boy is a minor, allowing him to cuddle like that could potentially be seen as problematic, depending on local laws and societal standards. In many places, there are strict guidelines about adult-child physical interactions to prevent abuse and exploitation. Even if the intentions are innocent, the situation might be misinterpreted, especially by others or the boyfriend's family.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about perception and potential appearance of impropriety. He might be concerned about how others might view the situation, even if there's no actual wrongdoing. The author allowed the child to stay in a position that could be seen as too intimate. While the author might not have pushed the child, allowing it to happen could still be problematic, especially since the boyfriend felt the need to address it.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions that the child was reserved and that she didn't push the issue. If the child initiated the cuddling and she didn't encourage it but allowed it passively, maybe there's a different angle. But the key is that she didn't stop it. In situations involving minors, even passive allowance can be an issue, depending on the context and the child's age.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's concern. His reaction, while maybe overzealous, is about protecting his child's well-being and boundaries. The author should consider his perspective, even if the situation seemed innocent. Communication is key here. The author might have misunderstood the appropriateness of the physical contact, not realizing how it could be perceived.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some might see it as sweet or innocent, others as inappropriate. The boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's the parent, and he's responsible for his child's boundaries. The author needs to respect that, even if she feels it was harmless.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author allowed a minor to have an intimate interaction with her, which could be seen as crossing a boundary from the boyfriend's perspective. Even if the intentions were good, the situation might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
