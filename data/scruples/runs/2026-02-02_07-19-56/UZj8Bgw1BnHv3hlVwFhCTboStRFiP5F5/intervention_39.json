We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle with her and fall asleep while the boyfriend was away. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend and the author live together, and they have the son every other week. The boyfriend wasn't home for a few hours, so the son and author were alone. The son crawled onto the couch with her, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author didn't push the son away and let it happen until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend then got upset, saying it was inappropriate and weird, and accused the author of not saying no.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, she might see the cuddling as a natural, comforting thing, especially since the son was reserved before. She didn't push it, and it happened when the boyfriend wasn't there. She felt happy about it, maybe seeing it as a bonding moment. \n\nOn the boyfriend's side, he might feel protective of his son and worried about the dynamic between his son and the relationship partner. He could be uncomfortable with the idea of his son having such physical closeness with someone other than family. It's possible he's concerned about the impression it might make or potential misunderstandings. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the situation seems to be about differing opinions on appropriateness. The author didn't force the child; the child initiated the cuddling. The mother figure (author) allowed it, which could be seen as affectionate. However, the boyfriend's reaction suggests he values boundaries in such situations. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author didn't do anything illegal or harmful. The issue is about personal boundaries and communication. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own feelings than any actual wrongdoing by the author. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She acted in a way that was kind and accepting of the child's needs, and the boyfriend's discomfort is his own issue to address, possibly through communication. The key point is that the author didn't overstep by allowing a child to seek comfort, especially in a situation where the parent was away.\n"
