We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her. The boyfriend got upset, thinking it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They live together and have the boy every other week. The author has been part of his life for two years. The situation happened when the boyfriend was out. The son initiated the cuddling after being reserved about it. The author didn't push it but let it happen. The boyfriend later freaked out, saying it looked weird and inappropriate, but then backtracked when asked if he was accusing her of something.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The son approached her, and she allowed it. Since the boy is a minor, there's a line about appropriate behavior. However, the author didn't initiate the cuddling; she let it happen. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort or projection rather than the son's actions. The author didn't cross any boundaries, as she respected the son's initiative and didn't push for more. The boyfriend's accusation might stem from insecurity or misunderstanding. In most cases, allowing a child to cuddle unless there's explicit concern about inappropriate behavior wouldn't make the adult at fault. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own feelings rather than the author's actions. So, the answer would be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
