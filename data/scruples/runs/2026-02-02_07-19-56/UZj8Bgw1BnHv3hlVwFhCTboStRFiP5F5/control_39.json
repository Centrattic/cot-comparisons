We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle with her. The situation is that the boyfriend got upset after his son fell asleep on her chest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend and the author live together and have the son every other week. They've been together for a few months, but she's been part of his life longer. The son is usually reserved with her, so when he initiated the cuddling, she let him stay. The boyfriend later got upset, saying it looked weird or inappropriate.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and the boyfriend's reaction. The author didn't push the child; the child came to her. She was lying on the couch, and the son crawled up. She allowed it but didn't initiate it. The boyfriend is upset about the appearance of it. \n\nI need to think about what's appropriate. If the son is a child, then cuddling with an adult is normal, especially if the child seeks comfort. The author didn't do anything inappropriate. The boyfriend's reaction might be based on his own insecurities or overprotectiveness. But is she wrong? Probably not. She respected the child's need for comfort and didn't force it. The real issue might be the boyfriend's lack of trust or communication. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is the problem, not her allowing the child to cuddle when the child initiated it.\n"
