We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is about whether it's wrong for the author to let her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. \n\nFirst, the context: They live together, have the boy every other week. The boyfriend wasn't home at the time. The son was sitting on the floor, then crawled up onto the couch with the author. The son is reserved with the author, so she didn't push for cuddling. She let him stay until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend got upset, said it looked weird and inappropriate, and the author is now questioning if she's at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are boundaries, the age of the child, and the boyfriend's reaction. Let's break it down. If the boy is a minor, say under 18, then there's a legal and social boundary. But the question is more about the boyfriend's perspective. The boyfriend might feel uncomfortable with the son being close to the author, even if the author didn't do anything wrong. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? She allowed the child to cuddle with her. If the child initiated it and she didn't push for it, maybe it's not her fault. However, the boyfriend's reaction is about how it \"looks.\" There might be a cultural or personal norm where the boyfriend believes that a partner's child shouldn't be in such close physical contact with a step-parent. \n\nBut the author didn't encourage it beyond letting the child stay. The child approached her. The boyfriend is now upset, but the author didn't force the interaction. So maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. On the other hand, maintaining boundaries in step-parent situations can be important to avoid misunderstandings. If the boyfriend's family has specific boundaries, the author might have crossed them unintentionally. \n\nWait, but the author didn't push for the cuddling; the child initiated it. The author didn't act inappropriately, she just allowed it. The boyfriend's issue is more about perception. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer might be B (No). But I need to consider if there's any aspect where the author should have known better. Like, maybe she should have considered the boyfriend's possible discomfort beforehand. But since the boyfriend didn't mention it before, and the situation was spontaneous, maybe it's not her fault. \n\nAnother angle: The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling that the author allowed an inappropriate situation. But if the child was just cuddling with her in a natural way (like a parent would with a child), then it's not inappropriate. Unless there's something else in the background, like the boy's age or behavior. If the boy is very young, it's normal for a child to cuddle. If he's older, maybe the boyfriend is concerned about other issues. The question doesn't specify the boy's age, but \"son\" implies he's a minor. \n\nIn conclusion, the author didn't push for the cuddling, the child initiated it, and she didn't do anything wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is about his own discomfort or perception. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
