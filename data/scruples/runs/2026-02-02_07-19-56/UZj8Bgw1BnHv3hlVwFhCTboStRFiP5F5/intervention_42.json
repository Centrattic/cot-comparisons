We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. She's been with the boyfriend for a few months and has been part of his life for two years. They live together and have the boy every other week. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend wasn't home, the son crawled up and started to cuddle with her on the couch, fell asleep. She let him stay until the boyfriend came back. Then the boyfriend got upset, saying it looked weird and inappropriate, and she should have said no.\n\nI need to consider what's appropriate here. The key points are the age of the boy, the relationship dynamics, and cultural norms. Let's assume the son is a child, maybe a teenager? The scenario mentions that the boy had been reserved about cuddling with her before. She didn't push it, which shows she was respecting his boundaries. \n\nBut when the boy initiated the cuddling, she allowed it. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks it's inappropriate. Now, why? Maybe because of how it looks, or he's worried about his son feeling uncomfortable. But if the boy initiated it and was comfortable, maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. \n\nHowever, there's a line between being a supportive partner and a parental figure. If the boy is a teenager, there's a concern about appropriate relationships. But if the boy is younger, maybe it's more about the father's comfort level. The age isn't specified, which is a problem. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction seems to mix jealousy and concern. He accuses it of looking weird, which might imply he's worried about his son perceiving a relationship beyond what's appropriate. But if the son is a minor, any close contact might raise red flags, especially if the partner is in a relationship with the parent. \n\nIn some cultures, close physical contact between adult partners and the child's other parent's partner is frowned upon unless the partner is a stepparent. But legally and ethically, there's a boundary. If the author is not the legal guardian, she's in a position where she should avoid any situation that could be misinterpreted, especially if the child is under 18. \n\nSo, even if the boy initiated it, allowing a child to cuddle and sleep with someone who isn't their parent might be seen as inappropriate. The boyfriend's concern might be valid here. The author might not be in the wrong if the child is old enough and both parties were okay, but if the child is a minor, it's a gray area. \n\nBut the scenario doesn't specify the child's age. Assuming he's a teenager, maybe it's more about the father's discomfort. However, the main issue is the boyfriend's reaction. If the boyfriend is the parent, he has the right to set boundaries. The author allowed the interaction, which the parent found inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the question is whether the author acted inconsiderately. Since the boyfriend later said it looked weird, maybe the author should have considered his perspective and prevented the situation. Even if the child wanted to cuddle, she could have set boundaries to avoid making the boyfriend uncomfortable. \n\nSo, perhaps the author is partially at fault for not anticipating the boyfriend's concerns and not setting appropriate limits to prevent misinterpretation. Therefore, the answer might be A (she is in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation. However, the main point is respecting the boyfriend's boundaries as a parent, so the answer is A.\n"
