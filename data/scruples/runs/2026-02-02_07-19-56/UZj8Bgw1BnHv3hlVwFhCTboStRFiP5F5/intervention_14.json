We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend's son cuddling with her and falling asleep, and then the boyfriend getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The boyfriend and the author live together and have the boy every other week. They've been together for a few months, but the author has been in the boyfriend's life for two years. The incident happened when the boyfriend was out; the son was sitting on the floor, then crawled up on the couch and laid on the author's chest. The author let him sleep there until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend got upset, saying it was inappropriate and that she should have said no. The author is confused because the boy was already showing some affection but was reserved, and she didn't push for it.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: the child initiated the cuddling, she didn't push it, and she was happy about the affection since the boy had been reserved. She didn't have ill intentions. The boy is a child, so cuddling with a caregiver or someone in a parental role might be common. The author is part of the household, living with the boyfriend and being present in his life for two years. The boyfriend is the one who later freaked out, which seems like an overreaction. The author didn't do anything to harm the boy or the relationship; she just allowed a natural, affectionate moment from the child. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or jealousy, especially if they're in a new relationship and he's not used to her being close with his son. But the author's actions were not manipulative or inappropriate. \n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective: he might feel that allowing his son to cuddle with the author could lead to misunderstandings or affect the boy's perception of boundaries. However, the boy is a child, and such affection is normal in a family setting. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about control or trust issues rather than the actual situation. If the author is a step-parent figure, a certain level of affection is expected. The key point is whether the author overstepped. Since the boy initiated it and the author didn't push for it, it seems reasonable. The boyfriend's anger without a valid reason (like the child being harmed) could indicate his own problems rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering all this, the author didn't do anything wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here. The author allowed a natural, affectionate gesture from the child, which is part of building a bond. The boyfriend's jealousy or insecurity is not the author's fault. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
