I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author allowed their boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with them while the boyfriend was out. The boyfriend got upset about it later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend and the author live together and have the son every other week. The author has been in the boyfriend's life for two years. The son was on the floor first, then crawled up to the couch. The author let him stay, and the boyfriend got upset, saying it looked weird and inappropriate. The author didn't push the son for affection but was okay with it.\n\nNow, the key points here. Is it inappropriate for a stepparent figure to cuddle with a child? It can be a gray area. On one hand, physical affection is normal, but there are boundaries to avoid any perception of impropriety, especially with children. The boyfriend's reaction is about it looking weird, not necessarily accusing the author of wrongdoing. However, the author's action might have crossed a line from the boyfriend's perspective, even if it wasn't intentional.\n\nBut then, the son initiated the cuddling. The author didn't push it. The boyfriend's son was reserved, so maybe the child felt comfortable. However, the boyfriend might feel uncomfortable with the child being that close to his partner, even if it's innocent. The author's responsibility here might be to respect the boyfriend's boundaries, even if they don't fully understand them.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the context is that the boyfriend later freaked out, which might indicate that his boundaries were not communicated beforehand. If the author wasn't aware that the boyfriend was uncomfortable with such interactions, they couldn't have known to avoid it. However, as a partner, the author might be expected to consider the boyfriend's potential sensitivities, especially regarding his child.\n\nBut in many cases, unless there's a prior agreement or known issue, allowing a child to cuddle isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about perception and personal discomfort rather than any actual misconduct. The author didn't act with malice; they were okay with the child's affection. The boyfriend's anger might be unwarranted if the situation was innocent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic, and the situation might be a case of miscommunication. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
