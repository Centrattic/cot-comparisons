We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's son cuddling and falling asleep with them. The boyfriend got upset, saying it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The couple lives together, and they have the boyfriend's son every other week. They've been together for a few months, but the author has been part of his life for two years. So, the son is used to the author's presence.\n\nThe son was on the floor initially, then crawled up onto the couch with the author, laying his head on her chest and falling asleep. The author didn't push the child away and let this happen until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend then freaked out, thinking it was inappropriate. The author didn't push the child for affection, and the child was reserved with her before. \n\nNow, considering boundaries between step-parents and step-children, in many cultures and legal systems, there are clear boundaries to prevent emotional or physical overstepping. The key points here are consent and appropriateness. The son initiated the cuddling, but the author allowed it. However, the boyfriend is the parent, so he might feel protective and concerned about how the situation could be perceived. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the child was a minor, and the author is in a relationship with the parent. Even if the child initiated it, allowing a child to cuddle and fall asleep in such an intimate position could be seen as crossing a line, depending on the context. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but his concern is about the appropriateness of the situation. The author didn't push the child, but she allowed the cuddling. \n\nIn some cases, even if both parties are comfortable, there's a potential for misinterpretation, especially in a blended family. The parent might feel that their partner is overstepping parental boundaries. However, the situation is more about the child seeking comfort, which could be natural. But since the author is in a relationship with the father, there's a need for caution to maintain appropriate boundaries to avoid any misunderstandings. \n\nSo, the answer here might be A (the author is in the wrong) because allowing a child to have such close physical contact, even if initiated by the child, could be seen as inappropriate in the context of the parent's relationship with the author. The parent's reaction, while perhaps overly emotional, is based on legitimate concerns about boundaries. Therefore, the author might have overstepped, even if unintentionally.\n"
