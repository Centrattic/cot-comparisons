We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The situation is that they live together, and the boy comes every other week. The boyfriend got upset, saying it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with the boy's father. The boy is a minor, so boundaries are important. Allowing a child to cuddle with someone, especially when the parent is not present, might raise concerns about appropriate behavior, even if the author didn't have bad intentions.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about it looking weird or inappropriate. The key points here might be consent from the parent and the perception of the situation. Even if the author didn't mean anything wrong, the parent might feel that the line was crossed, especially if it's a recurring thing or if there's a lack of clear boundaries.\n\nHowever, the son initiated the cuddling, and the author didn't push him to do it. She allowed it because the child was being affectionate, but she didn't force it. The boyfriend's frustration might stem from not being consulted or from feeling that the situation could be misinterpreted, even if the author's intentions were good.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author's actions might not be malicious, but the parent has a right to set boundaries for his child, especially regarding interactions with their partner. The fact that the boyfriend later backtracked but still felt it was inappropriate suggests that there's a breach of trust or unspoken rules on his part. The author might not be in the wrong, but she could have better communicated with her partner beforehand to set expectations, especially since they live together and the child is a regular presence in their home.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because there's no indication of malicious intent, and the child initiated the action. But the boyfriend's perspective is valid in terms of wanting to set boundaries. However, the author's actions alone don't necessarily make her at fault unless there was prior agreement to avoid such situations.\n"
