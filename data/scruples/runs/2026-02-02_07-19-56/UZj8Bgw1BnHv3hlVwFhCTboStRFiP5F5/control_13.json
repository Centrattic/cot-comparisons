We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her. They live together and have the kid every other week. The situation happened when the boyfriend was out. The boy crawled onto the couch with her, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. She let him stay until the boyfriend came back. Then the boyfriend got upset, thinking it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with the boy's father, and they're cohabiting. The boy is used to her presence, having been around for two years. The boy initiated the cuddling, which she allowed. The father is upset about it, saying it looks weird and inappropriate. She didn't push for the cuddling; the boy did, and she let it happen. \n\nNow, the key points: Was the author in the wrong? From a general perspective, allowing a child to cuddle and sleep with an adult in the same household, especially when the parent is absent, might be seen as crossing a boundary. However, the context matters. The boy initiated it, and the author didn't encourage it. The father is upset about the appearance, which might be more about his own feelings than an actual wrongdoing by the author. \n\nBut then, from a safety and appropriateness angle, especially in a co-parenting situation, there might be unspoken rules. The father could feel that even if the author didn't have ill intentions, allowing a child to sleep on an adult in that way could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of the actual relationship. However, the author's actions were likely comforting to the child, and she didn't force anything. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on perception rather than actual misconduct. The author didn't do anything that's a clear boundary violation, especially if the boy initiated it. The main issue is the boyfriend's discomfort with how it appears. In such cases, communication is key. But the question is whether the author was wrong. If she didn't act inappropriately and allowed a child to be comforted, it's probably not her fault. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own insecurities or overprotectiveness. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). She allowed a child to seek comfort, which is natural, and there's no indication she acted inappropriately. The boyfriend's reaction is his issue, not her wrongdoing.\n"
