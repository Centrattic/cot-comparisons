We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The situation is that the boyfriend got upset because he thought it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and her boyfriend live together, and they have his son every other week. She's been part of his life for two years, so there's some established relationship. The son was on the couch with her, head on her chest, and she let him sleep there until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend later freaked out, saying it looked weird and inappropriate, and she didn't push it, just let it happen without resistance.\n\nNow, I have to think about boundaries. The key question is whether the author overstepped by allowing the child to be in that physical position. The boyfriend's reaction is that it's inappropriate, but the author didn't push the child to do it. The child initiated crawling up, so she might have just let him be. \n\nBut from the boyfriend's perspective, he could feel protective, especially if he's the father. Maybe he's concerned about how others might perceive the situation, or he has strict boundaries about physical interactions between his partner and his child. Even if the author didn't have any intentions, the father's feelings matter here because he's the parent. So, maybe the author should have considered his potential discomfort and set a boundary beforehand, even if the child initiated it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't push it. The child came to her. She might have been trying to be kind and comforting to the child. The problem is that the father didn't communicate his boundaries clearly before this happened. If he had discussed his expectations about physical interactions between his son and his partner earlier, the author could have respected that. But since he didn't, maybe it's not entirely her fault.\n\nBut in relationships, especially when it comes to children, it's important to establish boundaries. The fact that the boyfriend didn't communicate this before and then reacted negatively after might indicate that the author isn't entirely wrong. However, maybe she should have anticipated his possible discomfort and not allowed the situation to escalate, even if it was the child's idea. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be in the wrong because the child initiated the interaction, and she didn't push it. However, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the father didn't set clear boundaries beforehand, maybe she's not the one at fault. Alternatively, she should have respected potential parental boundaries regardless of the child's initiative. Hmm. I'm leaning towards not at fault because she didn't force the interaction, but the father's reaction could be about his feelings rather than her actions. So answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
