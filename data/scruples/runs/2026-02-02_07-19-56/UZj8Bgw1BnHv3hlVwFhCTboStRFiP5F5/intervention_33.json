We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend got upset when the author allowed his son to cuddle and fall asleep with her while he was out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with the boy's father and they live together. They have the son every other week, so they have some regular contact. The son initiated crawling up to the author, and she let him stay. The father is upset, thinking it's inappropriate.\n\nThe key points to consider: Was the author being inappropriate? The son initiated, and the author didn't push for it. The father's reaction seems to be about boundaries, maybe feeling that the son's behavior crossed a line. The author's actions were passive\u2014just allowing the son to stay. But maybe the father is right to be concerned about the perception, especially in a co-parenting situation. \n\nBut on the other hand, the son was on the couch with the author, and the author didn't take advantage. The father was out for a few hours. If the son was comfortable and the author didn't encourage anything beyond what the son did, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, maybe the father has a right to set boundaries with his son and the author should have respected that by not allowing the cuddling.\n\nAnother angle: The father might be protective of his son and want to maintain certain boundaries between his son and his girlfriend. Even if the author didn't do anything wrong, allowing the son to cuddle could be seen as overstepping. But if the father didn't set rules about such interactions beforehand, maybe it's not entirely the author's fault.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if she didn't initiate it and just allowed it naturally. But maybe the father is right to be upset because of the potential for misunderstanding or inappropriateness. However, the situation doesn't show any malicious intent from the author. She was happy the son was comfortable but respected his boundaries otherwise. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she didn't push the interaction and it was a natural, passive situation. The father should have communicated his expectations earlier. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
