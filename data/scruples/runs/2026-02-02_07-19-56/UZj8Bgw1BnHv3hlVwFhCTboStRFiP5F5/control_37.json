We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's in a live-in relationship with her boyfriend, allowed his son to cuddle with her and fall asleep on the couch. The boyfriend got upset when he returned, thinking it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend's son was with them every other week, and the author had been part of his life for two years. The son initiated the cuddling by crawling up to her. She let him stay there until the boyfriend came back. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nThe author didn't push the child or initiate the cuddling. The child approached her, so it might be a natural affectionate gesture from the child. However, the boyfriend feels it was inappropriate. His reaction could stem from personal boundaries or feelings about how his son interacts with his partner. But is the author at fault here?\n\nI should consider if there were any prior agreements or discussions about boundaries with the boyfriend's son. If there were none, the author might not be in the wrong for allowing a child's natural affection. Also, the boyfriend's accusation of \"looks weird and inappropriate\" might be more about his feelings rather than the actual action. The author didn't do anything inappropriate on her own; the child's action was innocent.\n\nBut maybe the boyfriend was uncomfortable with his son being close to her in a way he didn't like. However, since the author was already part of their lives for a while and the child was comfortable, it's a common situation. The main issue is communication between the couple. The author might not be in the wrong, but perhaps the boyfriend needs to communicate his boundaries better. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author didn't do anything wrong, especially since the child initiated it and there was no prior indication of such boundaries.\n"
