We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting the boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The situation is that the boy was on the floor, then crawled up on the couch with her. She didn't push it, and he fell asleep. The boyfriend got upset when he came back, saying it's inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and her boyfriend live together and have the son every other week. She's been part of his life for two years. The son is probably a teenager or younger, as they're doing activities like watching TV and cuddling. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nThe author didn't push the situation; the boy initiated moving closer and fell asleep. She seems to be comfortable with physical affection but respects his boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from his own feelings about his son's interactions or cultural norms. However, the son was in their care, and the author allowed a comforting interaction that the boy initiated. \n\nFrom a typical perspective, allowing a child to cuddle and fall asleep on someone they trust, especially under supervision, is usually seen as a normal and comforting act. The boyfriend's outburst seems more about his own discomfort or misinterpretation rather than the author doing something wrong. The author didn't force the situation, so it's more about the boyfriend's feelings than her actions being wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong. The key factors are consent from the child, no forced interaction, and the context of a caregiving situation. The boyfriend's issue is with how it looks, but unless there was a prior agreement against such interactions, the author isn't at fault.\n"
