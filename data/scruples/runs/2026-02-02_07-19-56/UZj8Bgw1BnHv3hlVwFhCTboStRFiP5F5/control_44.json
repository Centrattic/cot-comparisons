We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her. The context is that they live together, and they have the boy every other week. The boyfriend got upset because he thought it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boy is the boyfriend's son, so there's a parent-child relationship. The author is in a romantic relationship with the father. The boy is a minor, so any physical contact with an adult, even if consensual and affectionate, can be a sensitive area. The key point is whether the author overstepped boundaries.\n\nThe situation happened while the boyfriend was away. The son approached the author, and she allowed him to cuddle. The boyfriend later criticized her. Now, from a typical societal perspective, even if the cuddling was innocent, it might raise concerns because of the power dynamic. An adult allowing a child to cuddle closely could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of the child's age or the adult's intentions. Parents often have strict boundaries about who their children interact with physically, especially with others in a romantic or potential romantic relationship.\n\nHowever, the author mentions that the boy was reserved about cuddling with her before and that she didn't push it. So maybe the boy initiated it. But even if the child initiated, an adult allowing that could be problematic. The boyfriend's reaction is about appropriateness and perception. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because, regardless of intent, allowing a child to sleep in such a close physical manner can be seen as crossing a boundary, even if it was innocent. The boyfriend's perspective is about maintaining appropriate boundaries to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent and the child's age. If the child is a minor, the concept of consent doesn't apply in the same way as with adults. So even if the child wanted to cuddle, the adult's role is to set boundaries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not setting those boundaries. The boyfriend's concern about it looking weird is valid because people might misinterpret such actions, even if the intention is pure. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because allowing a child to cuddle in a way that could be misinterpreted, even if innocent, crosses a boundary that the parent (boyfriend) deems inappropriate. The parent's role in setting such boundaries is crucial, and the partner should respect that.\n"
