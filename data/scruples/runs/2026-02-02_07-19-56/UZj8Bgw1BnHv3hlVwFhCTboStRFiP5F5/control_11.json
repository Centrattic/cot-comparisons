We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle with her. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they live together and have the boy every other week. The boyfriend was out for a few hours, so the author was alone with the kid. The boy crawled onto the couch with her, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author didn't push the kid away and let him stay until her boyfriend came back. Then the boyfriend got upset, saying it was inappropriate and weird, even backtracking from accusing her of something else.\n\nHmm. So what's the issue here? The boyfriend is upset about the cuddling. Is that a reasonable reaction? Well, the son is his child, so maybe the boyfriend is protective. But is the author doing something wrong? She mentions the son is reserved with her, so she didn't push. The son initiated the cuddling, and she let him stay. The key here is consent and boundaries.\n\nThe author didn't initiate the cuddling; the child did. She allowed it, but since the child was with her, maybe she thought it was okay. However, the boyfriend feels it's inappropriate. But is that his overprotectiveness or is there a real issue? The son is a minor, so the author isn't in a romantic or sexual relationship with him. The cuddling was a natural, affectionate action from the child, and allowing a child to sleep on someone can be normal, especially if they feel comfortable. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about trust and how it might look, but unless there's a history of issues, the author isn't doing anything wrong. She didn't do anything to the child; she let him be close, which is typical for a caring adult. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
