We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The boyfriend got upset, thinking it was inappropriate. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. They live together, and the boy is with them every other week. The author mentions that the son is usually reserved about cuddling, so she didn't push him. He came over on his own and fell asleep.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems based on perception\u2014he says it looks weird and inappropriate. But the author didn't do anything to encourage the son; she was just lying on the couch. The son initiated the physical contact, and she allowed it. \n\nI should think about the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with the father and is a step-parent figure. Allowing a child to snuggle and sleep on the couch with a step-parent isn't inherently wrong, especially if there's no ulterior motive. The boyfriend's anger might be more about how it appears rather than the action itself. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal norm the boyfriend is adhering to. However, the author didn't act inappropriately; she was comfortable with the child's affection. The key points are consent and context. Since the son is 2 years old, cuddling is a normal, innocent activity. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial accusation might have been harsh, but when the author asked if he was accusing her, he backtracked. That suggests maybe he was more upset about the perception than any real wrongdoing. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the author didn't do anything wrong. The child initiated the contact, and she allowed it without pushing. The boyfriend's reaction is about his own insecurities or how it might look, but the action itself isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
