We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend's son cuddled with her and fell asleep while the boyfriend was away. The boyfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a live-in relationship with her boyfriend, and they have his son every other week. The son initiated the cuddling, crawling up to her on the couch. The author didn't push him away, let him stay until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend then called it inappropriate and weird.\n\nHmm. The key points are consent and boundaries. The son approached her, so maybe he felt comfortable. The author didn't push him, just allowed it. But the boyfriend is upset because of how it might look. But why would letting a child cuddle with you be inappropriate? Unless there's a specific reason the boyfriend is uncomfortable, like maybe past experiences or cultural norms.\n\nWait, the author mentions that the son had been reserved about cuddling with her before, so this was a sign of him feeling safe. Allowing that could be seen as nurturing. But the boyfriend's reaction is about perception\u2014maybe he's worried about the appearance of impropriety. But a child falling asleep on someone else's chest isn't inherently wrong. Unless there's an actual relationship between the adult and the child beyond being a step-parent, it's a natural bonding moment.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. Even if the action itself isn't wrong, the boyfriend felt it was inappropriate. So maybe the issue is about respecting his boundaries and not engaging in behavior that he finds uncomfortable. The author didn't ask his son to cuddle, but allowed it. If the boyfriend had previously set clear boundaries about such interactions, then maybe the author should have been more cautious. But the scenario doesn't mention that. It seems like the son initiated, and the author didn't push back.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might not be in the wrong if the interaction was innocent and the son initiated it. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort rather than the author's actions being objectively wrong. However, if the boyfriend feels it's a boundary they should maintain, maybe the author should consider his feelings. But the question is whether she is in the wrong, not whether she should consider his feelings.\n\nSo, based on the information given, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
