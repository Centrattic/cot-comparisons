We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The situation is about whether the author (a woman) did something wrong by allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her while the boyfriend was away. The boyfriend later got upset about it, thinking it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend and the author live together and have the son every other week. The son was on the couch with her during TV time. The son crawled up and laid his head on her chest, and she let him stay until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend reacted negatively, saying it looked weird and inappropriate.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. To determine this, I need to think about typical boundaries in such situations. The son is a minor, and the author is in a relationship with his father. Allowing a child to cuddle can be seen as natural, especially if the child is seeking comfort. However, the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt it was inappropriate, possibly due to concerns about perceptions or boundaries between the adult and the child.\n\nBut is there any wrongdoing on the author's part? The key points are: the child initiated the cuddling, the author didn't push it, and she allowed it because the child was reserved. The boyfriend's son is in their care, so the author might have been trying to be affectionate. However, the boyfriend's concern is about how it might look. Legally, unless there's an explicit boundary discussed beforehand, it's hard to say the author is in the wrong. But in terms of relationship dynamics, maybe the boyfriend felt the action overstepped an unspoken boundary. However, without prior agreement that such actions are off-limits, the author might not be at fault. The reaction might stem from insecurity or miscommunication. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to consider if there's a reason to side with A. The author didn't force the situation, and the child was allowed to be close. Unless there's a legal or explicit rule broken, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his feelings than the action itself. So, the answer is B.\n"
