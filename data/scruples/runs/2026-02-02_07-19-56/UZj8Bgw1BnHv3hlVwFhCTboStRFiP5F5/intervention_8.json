We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her. The situation is that the boyfriend and the author live together, and they have his son every other week. The son crawled onto the couch with the author, lay on her chest, and fell asleep. The boyfriend got upset about it, thinking it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend and the author have been in a relationship for two years and live together now. The son is 2 years old? Wait, no, the user didn't specify the son's age. The user just said \"his son,\" so maybe the age is important. However, the original post doesn't mention the son's age. Wait, the user's question is the same as the AITA post. Let me check again.\n\nIn the post, the author mentions that the son has been \"reserved as far as cuddling and such with me,\" so maybe the son is a bit older, maybe a teenager or a young adult? Because if it's a young child, like a toddler, cuddling with an adult in the same household might not be as big of an issue, but if it's an older child, maybe it's more sensitive.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's reaction. He called it inappropriate, said it looks weird, and that the author should have told the son no. The author's defense is that the son came to her, and she didn't push for physical contact. She felt happy about it but didn't initiate it.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The answer should be A or B.\n\nIn terms of social norms, if it's a young child, like a toddler or a preschooler, it's common for kids to cuddle with adults, especially if they're in a shared living space. However, if the son is older, say a teenager, then it's more about boundaries and appropriateness. The boyfriend's concern might be about how it looks to others or about setting a boundary between the author and his son.\n\nThe author's actions were to allow the cuddling but not to initiate it. She didn't push the son, but allowed it because the son approached her. The boyfriend is upset, which could stem from his own insecurities or concerns about how others might perceive the situation. However, the author's responsibility is to her partner's feelings and to set appropriate boundaries in their household.\n\nIf the son is a minor and it's a common, innocent interaction, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the son is older and the interaction could be seen as crossing a line, the author might be at fault for not establishing clear boundaries. However, the post doesn't specify the son's age, so we have to assume it's a minor child, maybe a child who's used to being around the partner's new partner.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intentions and the context. If the author didn't have malicious intent and it was a natural interaction between a child and a trusted adult in a shared living space, then she might be justified. However, the boyfriend's reaction suggests that he has specific boundaries that the author didn't consider or communicate with him about beforehand.\n\nThe question is whether allowing a child from her boyfriend's life to cuddle with her in their home is inappropriate. If the son is a child, it's common for family members or close family friends to have such interactions. But if the boyfriend is uncomfortable with it, then the author should have respected his boundaries. However, the boyfriend's reaction could be over the top if the situation is harmless.\n\nBut since the author is in a relationship with the father, and the son is part of their shared life, maybe the author isn't at fault. However, the boyfriend's reaction might be about his own feelings of jealousy or not wanting his son to form a close bond with his girlfriend. Alternatively, it could be about societal norms or fears of inappropriate relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, without knowing the son's age, it's a bit tricky. But if it's a minor child, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the boyfriend explicitly has boundaries about such interactions, even with a minor, the author might have a responsibility to respect that. Since the author didn't know the son was reserved about cuddling, but allowed it because the son initiated, it's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the author should have anticipated the boyfriend's discomfort and avoided the situation. If the boyfriend didn't communicate his boundaries clearly, the author might not be at fault. But if the boyfriend had prior concerns, then she should have been more cautious.\n"
