We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the woman allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle with her while the boyfriend was out. The boyfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend and the woman live together, and they have custody of his son every other week. The woman has been part of his life for two years. When the boyfriend was away, the son crawled onto the couch with her and fell asleep. She let him stay until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend got upset, called it inappropriate, and she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nI should consider cultural norms and boundaries. Cuddling between an adult and a child can be sensitive, especially if the child is not their own. The boyfriend might feel protective of his son, and even if there's no malicious intent, allowing physical closeness might make him uncomfortable. However, the woman's intention was likely comforting the child, and the son initiated the cuddling, not her. She didn't push it; she let him stay until the dad came back.\n\nOn the other hand, boundaries are important in such situations. The boyfriend might have specific expectations about how his son interacts with his partner. Even if the woman meant no harm, not considering his potential discomfort could be a misstep. The key here is communication. If the boyfriend hadn't discussed his boundaries beforehand, the woman might not be entirely at fault. But once he expressed his concerns, she should respect that in the future.\n\nThe question is whether she was in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether her actions crossed the boyfriend's boundaries. Since the situation happened once and the boyfriend was upset after, it's possible that she didn't know his limits. However, allowing a child to cuddle in such a way could be seen as crossing a line if the boyfriend is uncomfortable. But the child initiated it, which complicates things.\n\nIn many cases, people might see the woman as not at fault because she was responding to the child's natural behavior. But others might argue that she should have set boundaries to prevent the situation from happening. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she didn't force the interaction and the child initiated it. However, if the boyfriend had previously discussed boundaries and she ignored them, then she would be at fault. The scenario doesn't mention prior discussions, so it's a bit ambiguous. Considering that the boyfriend was upset after the fact and she asked if he was accusing her of something, it's possible that she's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
