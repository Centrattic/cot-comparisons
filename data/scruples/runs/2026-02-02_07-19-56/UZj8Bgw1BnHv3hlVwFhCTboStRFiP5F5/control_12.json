We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend got upset when she allowed his son to cuddle and fall asleep with her while the boyfriend was out. The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the age of the son, and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend live together and have his son every other week. They've been together for two years, but only living together for a few months. The son crawled onto the couch and fell asleep on her. The boyfriend later got upset, thinking it was inappropriate.\n\nI need to consider if allowing the child to cuddle with her is wrong. If the son is a minor, like maybe a teenager or younger, then it's about boundaries. The author didn't push for physical contact, and the son initiated it. Letting a child fall asleep on you, especially in a parental figure role, could be seen as a natural gesture. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also important. He might feel protective or uncomfortable with physical intimacy between his girlfriend and his son.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if the son is a child, allowing him to cuddle isn't inherently wrong. Parents often allow children to be affectionate. However, the boyfriend's perspective is about how it might look to others or possible misinterpretations. The author didn't act in a way that suggests impropriety; she let the child stay until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend's freak out might be overreaching, but the author should consider his feelings in the future. However, in most contexts, allowing a child to cuddle isn't wrong unless there's a specific reason to avoid it. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
