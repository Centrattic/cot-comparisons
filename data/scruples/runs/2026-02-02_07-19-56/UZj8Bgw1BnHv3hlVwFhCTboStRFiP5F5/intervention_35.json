We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The situation is that the boyfriend got upset later about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and her boyfriend live together, and she's been part of his life for two years. They have his son every other week. The boy is probably a teenager or younger, given the situation. The author was on the couch, the son was on the floor, then moved up to her. She didn't push the boy, and he was reserved before. She let him stay until the boyfriend came back.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset, saying it's inappropriate. The question is whether the author did something wrong. From the description, the author didn't initiate the cuddling; the son did. She allowed it but didn't push him. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own feelings about boundaries, not necessarily the author acting inappropriately. \n\nBut maybe the boyfriend feels protective of his son and is uncomfortable with another adult being so physically close. However, if the son initiated and the author didn't overstep, maybe she's not at fault. The key points are consent and intent. The author didn't force the situation; she responded to the son's actions. Since the son was sleeping, there's no indication of impropriety from the author's side. The boyfriend's reaction might be about trust or his own insecurities rather than the author's actions. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because she allowed a natural, non-threatening interaction initiated by the son, and there's no evidence of misconduct from her side.\n"
