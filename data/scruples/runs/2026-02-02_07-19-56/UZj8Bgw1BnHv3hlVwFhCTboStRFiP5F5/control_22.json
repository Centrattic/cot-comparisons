We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about allowing the boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep on her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend and the author live together, and they have his son every other week. The boyfriend was out when the son cuddled with the author. The boyfriend later got upset, saying it was inappropriate.\n\nThe key points to consider: Was the cuddling inappropriate? The son approached her, and she allowed it. The author mentions the boy was reserved about cuddling and she didn't push it. She felt happy about it, which might suggest it was a genuine moment of comfort. The boyfriend is upset, but maybe he's overreacting. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, she didn't initiate it; the child did. She didn't push the child, just allowed it. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort or perception of how it looks rather than any wrongdoing by the author. Unless there's a prior agreement that such things should be avoided, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, there's a step-parent dynamic here. Even though she might not be the legal parent, allowing a child to cuddle in that way might be seen as crossing boundaries by some people. But the context is that the boy was comfortable, and she was just letting him be. The boyfriend's issue is more about appearance and what others might think. \n\nAlso, the author didn't do anything that could be considered inappropriate. Letting a child sleep on your chest isn't wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be from his own insecurities or fears. The author didn't violate any laws or ethical standards here. So the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
