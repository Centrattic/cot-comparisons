We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about allowing the boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman is in a relationship with the boyfriend, and they live together. They have his son every other week. The son approached her on the couch, crawled up, and fell asleep. She didn't push him away and let him stay until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend was upset, called it inappropriate, and she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries between stepparents and stepchildren, cultural norms, the age of the child, and the boyfriend's feelings. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, I need to consider if her actions were inappropriate regardless of the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nI should think about typical family dynamics. In many modern families, step-parents and stepchildren can have close, affectionate relationships. However, there's often a line to avoid actions that might be seen as overstepping, especially if the biological parent is uncomfortable. The son was two years in their lives, so maybe the woman has a bond with the child. Allowing cuddling isn't inherently wrong, but the boyfriend's reaction is important. But does that make the woman at fault?\n\nThe son initiated the cuddling by crawling up. The woman didn't push him away. If she's been in the child's life for two years, maybe it's a natural progression. However, the boyfriend's discomfort might stem from protecting his son's boundaries or his own feelings. But is the woman at fault for allowing it? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIf the child is of an age where physical boundaries are important, then maybe the woman should consider that. However, if the child is young, say a teenager, then it's different. The scenario doesn't specify the child's age, which is a key factor. Without knowing the age, it's hard to judge, but generally, allowing a child to cuddle could be seen as affectionate but might cross a line if the biological parent is uncomfortable. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often considers intentions and the other person's feelings. The woman didn't push the child to cuddle; the child initiated it. She didn't do it to be inappropriate. However, the boyfriend's reaction is valid, but does that make her wrong? Maybe not. The answer could be B, not in the wrong, because she didn't force the interaction, and if the child felt comfortable, it might be natural. But if the boyfriend's rules are clear, then maybe she should have respected that. But since the scenario says the boyfriend freaked out after she allowed it, and the woman didn't push it, her actions might be seen as okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the boyfriend is overreacting, but the question is about the author's wrongness. Without knowing the child's age and the prior boundaries, but given that the woman didn't push it and the child initiated, it's more likely that she isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
