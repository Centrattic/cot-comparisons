We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep.

I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and his son live with the author, and they have him every other week. That might mean there's a regular arrangement. The boyfriend was out for a few hours, so the son was with the author. The son crawled up on the couch, laid with his head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author felt happy about it since the boy has been reserved with her before. She let him stay until the boyfriend came back. Then the boyfriend got upset, saying it looked weird and inappropriate, though he didn't outright accuse her of misconduct.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author allowed the child to cuddle with her. The boyfriend is upset about it. But the author didn't push for physical contact; the child initiated it. She let him stay but didn't push it. The boyfriend's reaction is about it looking inappropriate rather than the act itself. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the child initiated the cuddling and she allowed it without forcing, maybe it's natural. Kids often seek comfort from any trusted adult. However, the boyfriend's perspective is important. If he has specific boundaries about how his son interacts with his partner, even in his absence, the author might have overstepped if she was aware of those boundaries beforehand. \n\nBut the scenario says the author didn't push it and the boy was reserved before. Also, she let him stay until the boyfriend returned. It seems like she wasn't the instigator. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the situation could be misinterpreted, but the author's actions were likely just comforting the child. Unless there were prior agreements about such interactions, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be overprotective or a matter of personal boundaries, but the act itself isn't inherently wrong. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
