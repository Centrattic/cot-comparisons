We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, have the boy every other week. The boyfriend was out, the son crawled onto the couch with the author, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author didn't push the boy away and let him stay until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend got upset, saying it was inappropriate and weird, implying the author should have said no.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boundaries between the author and the boyfriend's son. The son is a child, and the author is in a relationship with his father. The act of cuddling and the father's reaction are central.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, when a parent is uncomfortable with their partner being close to their child in a certain way, even if the interaction seems innocent, the parent's feelings need to be respected. The father might feel that any physical closeness between the partner and his child could be misinterpreted, especially if they live together. It's important to consider the father's perspective, as he's the parent and may have concerns about perceived impropriety or potential misunderstandings.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were not necessarily malicious. She allowed the child to cuddle, which is a natural, affectionate gesture. The son initiated the contact, and the author didn't push it. She might have been trying to bond with the child, which is common for step-parents. But the issue here is about communication and respecting the boyfriend's boundaries.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could stem from his own values or past experiences. He might have boundaries about physical contact between his partner and his child, especially when he's not present. Even if the author didn't have any improper intentions, the father's feelings are valid. In relationships, especially involving step-parenting, it's crucial to align on boundaries and communicate them to avoid such conflicts.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped. While her actions were likely well-meaning, the father's discomfort indicates that she might have crossed a line he didn't communicate clearly beforehand. Even if the cuddling was innocent, the father's perspective matters here because he's the parent. The author should have considered his potential discomfort and maybe set a boundary or discussed it beforehand. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), not because she had bad intentions, but because she didn't consider the parent's feelings and boundaries in this situation.\n"
