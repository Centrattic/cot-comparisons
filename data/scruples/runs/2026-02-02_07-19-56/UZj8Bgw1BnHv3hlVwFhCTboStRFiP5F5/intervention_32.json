We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for letting their boyfriend's son cuddle with them and fall asleep. The boyfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend and the author live together and have his son every other week. They've been in a relationship for a few months, but the author has been part of his life for two years. The situation in question happened when the boyfriend was out. The son, who has been reserved with the author regarding physical affection, crawled onto the couch and laid his head on her chest before falling asleep. The author let him stay, and the boyfriend later got upset, thinking it looked inappropriate.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the son initiated the physical contact, he's been reserved before, and the author didn't push it. The boyfriend is upset about the perceived inappropriateness. Now, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nI need to evaluate from different angles. From a social standpoint, allowing a child to cuddle and fall asleep on someone else's chest could be seen as normal, especially if the child is comfortable with it. However, the boyfriend's reaction might stem from concerns about boundaries, especially since he's the parent. He might worry about the child's well-being or how others might perceive the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the cuddling. The son did, and the author allowed it. Since the child is in their care, the parent might have specific expectations about how others interact with his child. The key here is whether the author overstepped by not setting a boundary, even if the child initiated it. But the author says they were happy about it since the child is usually reserved, and they didn't push for it. \n\nLegally and ethically, unless there's a history of inappropriate behavior, allowing a child to have affectionate contact isn't inherently wrong. However, in relationships, trust and boundaries can vary. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own discomfort or trust issues rather than the action itself. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person at fault is the one who overreacts. The boyfriend's \"freaking out\" might be the bigger issue here, especially if the author acted within reasonable bounds. The author didn't encourage the child to cuddle but allowed it when initiated. \n\nSo, the author's actions seem okay, and the boyfriend's reaction might be the problem. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
