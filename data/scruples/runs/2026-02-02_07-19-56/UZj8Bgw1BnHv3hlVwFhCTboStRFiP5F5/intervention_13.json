We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The situation says they live together, have the boy every other week. The boyfriend was out for a few hours when this happened. The son was on the floor first, then crawled up to the couch and laid his head on her chest, falling asleep. She let him stay until the boyfriend came back. The boyfriend got upset, said it was inappropriate and looked weird.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is in a relationship with the boy's father, so she's a partner. The son is 2 years in her life, so maybe there's a bond. The boy was reserved about cuddling, so the fact that he initiated this might be positive. She didn't push him, just allowed it when he came to her. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about it looking weird. But why? The boy was asleep, so there's no active interaction. The author didn't do anything inappropriate; she just let him stay. She didn't push for physical contact. Maybe the boyfriend is uncomfortable with someone else being that close to his son, especially when he's not there. That could be insecurity or overprotectiveness. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing on the author's part? She didn't violate any boundaries the boy set\u2014he approached her. She respected his need for space before. The situation was a natural progression where the child felt comfortable. The boyfriend's issue is more about perception rather than actual action. The author didn't do anything to harm or take advantage. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his feelings rather than the author's actions.\n"
