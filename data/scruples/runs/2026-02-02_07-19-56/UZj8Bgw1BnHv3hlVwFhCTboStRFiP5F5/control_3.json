We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see.\n\nThe situation is that the author, who's in a live-in relationship with her boyfriend, had his son every other week. The boyfriend was out for a few hours, and the son crawled up on the couch with her, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author allowed this and was happy about it since the kid had been reserved but sometimes hugs. When the boyfriend came back, he freaked out about it being inappropriate, but then backtracked when she asked if he was accusing her of something, saying it just looked weird and she should have said no.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author and her boyfriend have been together for two years and live together now. The son is staying with them every other week. The author didn't push the child for physical contact, so she was respecting his boundaries. The child initiated the cuddling and fell asleep. The author didn't take advantage; she let him stay until the boyfriend returned.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset because he thinks it's inappropriate. However, his reaction seems more about how it looked rather than the child's actions. The author didn't do anything to encourage or force the child. Cuddling with a child in a family setting, especially when the child is tired and the parent is absent temporarily, might be a normal comforting behavior. The key here is that the author is part of the child's life and the boyfriend might be feeling jealous or concerned about boundaries. But the author's action was consensual and comforting. The boyfriend's initial accusation might be unfair, especially since the child didn't do anything wrong. The author's choice to let the child rest is reasonable, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own feelings than the child's actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
