We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her while the boyfriend was away. \n\nFirst, the key points: The boyfriend and the author live together, they have custody of his son every other week. The boyfriend was out for a few hours. The son was on the couch, head on her chest, fell asleep. The boyfriend got upset when he came back, saying it was inappropriate and that she should've said no.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider the dynamics here. \n\nThe author mentions that the son has been reserved in showing affection with her, so this cuddling is a positive development. She didn't push for it; he initiated. She allowed it because he seemed to be seeking comfort. However, the boyfriend is upset because he finds it inappropriate. \n\nFrom a step-parent or caregiver perspective, showing affection to a child is generally acceptable, unless there's a specific boundary. But the boyfriend is uncomfortable with the perceived closeness. The question is whether allowing the child to cuddle is wrong. \n\nIn many cases, physical affection between a caregiver and a child is normal, especially when the child is seeking comfort. However, the boyfriend might feel that it's crossing a line. The problem here is the boyfriend's reaction rather than the author's action. The author didn't initiate it; the child did. She allowed it without pushing boundaries. \n\nBut maybe the boyfriend feels that the physical closeness is too intimate for a step-parent or that the situation could be misinterpreted. However, the scenario describes a child falling asleep on someone he's been around for two years. It's a natural response for a child to seek comfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own insecurities or boundaries that weren't clearly communicated beforehand. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she didn't encourage the behavior beyond allowing it, and the child initiated it, it's hard to say she's at fault. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his feelings than the act itself. Unless there were prior explicit rules about physical contact with his son, the author wasn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
