We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her while the boyfriend was away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend and the author live together and have the son every other week. The boyfriend was out for a few hours, and during that time, the son, who's been reserved with the author, decided to crawl up on the couch and lay on her chest, falling asleep. The author didn't push the child away and let it happen until the boyfriend returned.\n\nThe boyfriend later freaked out, saying it was inappropriate. The author is confused because the child was the one who initiated the cuddling, and she didn't push it. She even mentions that the child has been reserved with her, so she didn't want to overstep. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on perception\u2014saying it looks weird or inappropriate.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The key points here are about boundaries, intentions, and cultural or personal beliefs. In many cultures, allowing a child to cuddle with an adult can be seen as a natural expression of comfort and affection, especially if the child is in a family setting. However, some people might have different views based on their upbringing or personal boundaries.\n\nThe boyfriend's concern might stem from jealousy or fear that others could misinterpret the situation. But the author didn't encourage the cuddling beyond what the child initiated. She didn't take advantage; she simply allowed the child to rest. The fact that the child initiated the cuddling and the author didn't push it suggests she wasn't trying to cross boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own feelings of insecurity or fear of appearance rather than the actual situation's impropriety.\n\nAnother angle is the child's age and understanding. If the child is young, cuddling with an adult in a family-like setting might not be inappropriate. However, if the child is older, there could be different considerations. The scenario doesn't specify the child's age, but the fact that the child was able to initiate the cuddle and the author allowed it suggests it's within a typical sibling or close adult-child relationship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author didn't force the situation. She was in a position where the child approached her. The boyfriend might need to communicate his boundaries more clearly to his son if he's uncomfortable with such interactions. The author's actions were not malicious; she was providing comfort to a child who sought it. So, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be the issue here, not the author's actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She acted appropriately by allowing the child to find comfort and didn't overstep by initiating any contact. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own perceptions rather than any wrongdoing by the author.\n"
