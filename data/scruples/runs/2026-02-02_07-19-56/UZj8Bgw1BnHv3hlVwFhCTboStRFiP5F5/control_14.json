We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her while the boyfriend was away. The boyfriend got upset and thought it looked inappropriate.\n\nFirst, the context: They live together and have the son every other week. The boyfriend wasn't home for a few hours. The son initiated the cuddling, moving from the floor to the couch with the author. She didn't push him away and let him stay until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend later freaked out, saying it was inappropriate.\n\nNow, the key points here. The son is a child, and the situation happened in the presence of the author's live-in boyfriend. The boyfriend is the father, so there's a parent-child relationship. The author is in a romantic relationship with the father. The act of cuddling between a child and an adult can be sensitive, especially in a stepparent or partner-in-charge dynamic.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, physical affection between adults and children is common, like hugging or sleeping together for comfort. But when it comes to boundaries, especially when the adult is in a romantic relationship with the parent, it can be a gray area. The boyfriend's reaction might be based on feeling that the line was crossed, even if the author didn't have any inappropriate intentions.\n\nHowever, the son initiated the cuddling. The author didn't push it. She allowed the child to be close, possibly out of comfort. But maybe the boyfriend felt that as a non-biological parent, the author shouldn't be in that physical space with the child, especially when they're living together. There's also the aspect of how actions might be perceived. Even if there's no wrongdoing, the appearance can matter in such relationships.\n\nBut the author didn't do anything to initiate the cuddling. The son moved closer on his own. The author didn't refuse, which could be seen as passive acceptance. However, since the boyfriend later felt it was a problem, the question is about whether the author should have set a boundary earlier, even if the son approached her.\n\nOn one hand, the author might not be at fault because the child was naturally seeking comfort. On the other hand, the boyfriend's feelings and the potential for misunderstanding might make the author responsible for not addressing the situation. The answer depends on whether the action was a breach of the boyfriend's expectations and if the author should have considered those boundaries beforehand.\n\nIn many cases, step-parents are advised to maintain certain boundaries to avoid conflicts in the parent's relationship. Allowing close physical contact might not be appropriate even if well-intended. The author might be in the wrong because she didn't consider the boyfriend's potential discomfort, even if he didn't communicate it initially. The answer could be A, but I need to check if the action itself was wrong regardless of intent. Since the boyfriend is the father, the author's role as a partner might require her to be more cautious about physical interactions with the child to avoid any perception of impropriety. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
