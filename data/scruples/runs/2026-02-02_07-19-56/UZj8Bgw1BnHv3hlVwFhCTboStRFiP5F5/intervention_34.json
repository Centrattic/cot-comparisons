We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's boyfriend got upset when the author allowed his son to cuddle and fall asleep with her while the boyfriend was away. The key points to consider are the nature of the interaction, the boyfriend's perspective, and whether the author overstepped any boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the boy initiated the cuddling by crawling up to the couch where she was lying. The author didn't push for it; she was just lying on the couch. The boy was sitting on the floor first, then moved closer. The author didn't encourage it beyond letting him stay once he initiated. She let him sleep until the boyfriend returned. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is based on it being inappropriate or weird. But from the author's side, she was trying to be affectionate with the child, and the child was the one who wanted to cuddle. The author didn't act inappropriately, and the action itself seems like a natural expression of comfort between a child and someone they trust. The boyfriend's concern might stem from not wanting any perceived impropriety, but the situation seems innocent. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or personal boundary that the author didn't consider. The boyfriend might have specific expectations about how his son interacts with others, especially someone who's not a parent. The author's role as a partner might include respecting the boyfriend's boundaries around his son's interactions. If the author knew the boyfriend had reservations about such physical affection, maybe she should have been more cautious. But the author says she's been present in his life for two years and the boy has been reserved about cuddling, so she didn't push it. She allowed the boy's initiative, which seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that allowing the son to cuddle with the author without his presence could be misinterpreted by others. But the context is that the boyfriend was away for a few hours, and the child initiated the cuddling. The author didn't do anything to encourage it beyond passive acceptance. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? The action itself seems innocent, and the boyfriend's reaction might be overprotective or based on his own discomfort. However, the boyfriend is the parent, and maybe the author should have considered his feelings more, even if the action wasn't wrong. But since the child initiated it and the author didn't push, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The situation is about a child seeking comfort, and the author letting him do so without overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own feelings than the author's actions being truly inappropriate.\n"
