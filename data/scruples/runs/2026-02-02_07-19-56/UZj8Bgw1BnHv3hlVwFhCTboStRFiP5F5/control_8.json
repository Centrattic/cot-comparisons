We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend getting upset because she let his son cuddle with her and fall asleep while he was out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend and the author live together and have the boy every other week. The author has been part of his life for two years. The incident happened when the boyfriend was out for a few hours. The son was watching TV with the author. He started on the floor, then moved to the couch and fell asleep on her chest. The boyfriend came back and was upset, thinking it's inappropriate. The author is confused because the son has hugged her before but been reserved otherwise. She didn't push it and let him stay until he woke up. The boyfriend then accused it of being weird and inappropriate, and the author is now asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the son initiated the cuddling, the author didn't push for it, she was comfortable with it, and the boyfriend is upset about it. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, allowing a child to cuddle and fall asleep on someone else, especially when it's the parent's child, can be seen as normal and comforting. The author didn't force the situation; the child came to her. It's a common scenario where a child feels safe and comfortable with someone. However, the boyfriend's reaction is based on the perception that it's inappropriate, perhaps due to concerns about boundaries or how others might perceive it. But the author didn't do anything wrong by letting the child be with her, especially since the child initiated it and it's a natural behavior for a child to seek comfort.\n\nThe boyfriend's issue might stem from his own insecurities or overprotectiveness. However, the author's actions don't seem malicious or inappropriate. She respected the child's autonomy by letting him come to her and didn't push for cuddling. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
