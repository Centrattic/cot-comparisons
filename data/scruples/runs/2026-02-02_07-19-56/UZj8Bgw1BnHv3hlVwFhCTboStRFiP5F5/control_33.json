We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle with her and fall asleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend and his son live with the author. They've been together a few months, but she's been part of his life for two years. The son was with them every other week. The boyfriend left for a few hours, and the son came to the couch, crawled up, and fell asleep on her. The boyfriend got upset when he came back, saying it was inappropriate.\n\nNow, the key points here. The son is a minor, and the author is in a relationship with his father. The situation involves physical contact between an adult and a child, which can be sensitive. The boyfriend is upset, thinking it's inappropriate, but the author didn't push for it; the child initiated it. \n\nI need to consider the context. The son has been reserved with cuddling, so this might be a sign of trust. However, the boyfriend's concern might be about boundaries. The author didn't push the child, just allowed it. But from the boyfriend's perspective, even if the child initiated, allowing it could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAlso, the age of the son isn't mentioned here. If the child is very young, like a toddler, maybe it's more innocent. But if he's older, maybe the boyfriend is more sensitive. \n\nThe author's intention was positive, but boundaries in co-parenting situations can be tricky. The boyfriend might feel that as a partner, she should maintain certain boundaries with his son to avoid any appearance of impropriety. The author didn't act inappropriately, but the situation might have been misinterpreted. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the child initiated and the author allowed it without pushing, maybe not. But the boyfriend's reaction suggests he feels it's a boundary issue. Since the author didn't force anything and the child was already in her care, maybe she's not at fault. But depending on cultural or personal norms, it could vary. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the answer often depends on whether the person acted with malicious intent or crossed a clear line. Here, the author didn't do that, so the answer might be B. However, the boyfriend's perspective is valid in terms of maintaining boundaries. But the author's action was passive, allowing something the child initiated. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because she didn't push for the cuddling, and the child initiated it. But there's a need for better communication about boundaries between the couple. The boyfriend's reaction might be about his own insecurities or concerns, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
