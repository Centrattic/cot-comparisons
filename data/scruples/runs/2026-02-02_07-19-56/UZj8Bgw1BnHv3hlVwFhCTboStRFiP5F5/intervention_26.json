We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The boyfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author and her boyfriend live together, and they have his son every other week. The son was watching TV, and he crawled onto the couch to lie on her chest and fell asleep. The boyfriend was out at the time. When he came back, he freaked out, saying it was inappropriate. The author was okay with it because the kid initiated it, and she didn't push for more.\n\nNow, the key points here are the dynamics between the author, the boyfriend, and the son. The son is a child, so the boyfriend might be protective. But the author is in a relationship with the father, so there's an expectation of boundaries. Even if the child initiated the cuddling, allowing it could be seen as crossing a line from the boyfriend's perspective. He might feel uncomfortable with his son being physically close to his girlfriend, especially in a way that's intimate. \n\nHowever, the author didn't force the interaction. The child came to her, and she allowed it without pushing. She might not have realized the sensitivity of the situation. But from the boyfriend's point of view, he might see it as inappropriate because it could potentially lead to misunderstandings or make the child feel uncomfortable in the future. \n\nAlso, considering social norms, there's an expectation to maintain certain boundaries with stepchildren. Even if the intentions are good, the boyfriend's reaction might be valid because he's the parent, and he has the final say in what he's comfortable with. The author might not be aware of this, but respecting his boundaries is important in their relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the boyfriend clearly communicated his discomfort before, then the author might be at fault for not respecting that. But if this was the first time and there was no prior discussion, maybe the author didn't know. However, since they've been together for two years, the expectation might be that she's aware of his boundaries. \n\nIn this case, the boyfriend's reaction is about feeling that the interaction was inappropriate, even if the author didn't have bad intentions. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because she allowed the interaction without considering the boyfriend's possible discomfort, even if unintentionally.\n"
