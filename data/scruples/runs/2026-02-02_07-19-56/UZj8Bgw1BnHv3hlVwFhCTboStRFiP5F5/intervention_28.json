We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and his girlfriend who are living together and take care of his son every other week. The boyfriend was out, and his son, who's been a bit reserved with the girlfriend, ended up cuddling and falling asleep on her. The boyfriend later got upset, saying it was inappropriate and that the girlfriend should have told the son no. The user thinks the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong, but they're curious about my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The key points here are the age of the boy, the relationship dynamics, and the boyfriend's level of discomfort. The scenario doesn't mention the son's age, which is crucial. If the boy is a young child, like under 10, cuddling is a normal and affectionate gesture, and it's common for children to seek comfort from caregivers. However, if the boy is a teenager, the situation might be more complicated and could touch on boundaries that the boyfriend is concerned about. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is important. He \"freaked out\" and said it looked \"weird and inappropriate.\" That suggests he felt there was something off about the situation. The girlfriend mentions the boy had been reserved about cuddling, so maybe this was a special moment for him. She didn't push for physical contact, which is a good sign. However, allowing a child of any age to fall asleep on her in that position might raise red flags for the boyfriend, especially if the child is older. \n\nIf the son is a young child, the girlfriend's actions are innocent and nurturing. But if he's older, the boyfriend might perceive it as overstepping boundaries. The lack of age information makes this tricky. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own insecurities or perceptions rather than any explicit wrongdoing by the girlfriend. The girlfriend didn't initiate the cuddling and allowed it naturally, which isn't inherently wrong. \n\nHowever, considering the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel that the girlfriend should have set boundaries to avoid any appearance of impropriety, especially if the son is a teenager. The girlfriend didn't do anything to prevent the cuddling, so while her intentions were good, she might have been careless about how it could be perceived. \n\nBut in most cases, especially with younger kids, this isn't a big issue. The boyfriend's reaction could be overblown or based on his own jealousy or discomfort with the situation. The girlfriend didn't cross any lines, so unless there's more context about the son's age and the boyfriend's specific concerns, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer leans towards the girlfriend not being in the wrong (B), especially if the son is a younger child. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own feelings rather than any actual wrongdoing by the girlfriend. The key missing piece is the son's age, but given the information, the girlfriend's actions seem acceptable.\n"
