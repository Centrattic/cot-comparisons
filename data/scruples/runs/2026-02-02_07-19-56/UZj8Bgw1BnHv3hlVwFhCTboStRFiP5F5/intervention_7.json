We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle with her while the boyfriend was away. The boyfriend got upset about it, thinking it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend and his son have a custody arrangement where the son is with them every other week. They've been living together for a few months, and the author has been part of the boyfriend's life for two years. The son is described as being reserved with the author, so the cuddling is a new development.\n\nThe key points are: the son initiated the cuddling by crawling onto the couch, the author didn't push for it, and she was okay with it. The boyfriend later freaked out, thinking it looked bad. The author didn't push the son to cuddle; he did it on his own. She didn't do anything to encourage inappropriate behavior beyond allowing a natural, affectionate moment between a child and someone they're comfortable with.\n\nFrom a child's perspective, cuddling with a trusted adult is normal. If the author had a close relationship with the child, which seems to be the case, then allowing the child to fall asleep on her chest could be seen as a comforting gesture. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or overprotectiveness rather than the action itself being wrong. The author didn't act in a way that would suggest any impropriety; she just allowed a moment of comfort between a child and a caregiver.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's feelings are valid in the sense that boundaries between adults and their partners' children can be tricky. But in this case, the author wasn't initiating anything; the child did. The author's response was to let the child be comfortable, which isn't necessarily wrong. The boyfriend might need to communicate his concerns better, but the author's action was in response to the child's initiative, not hers. So, probably not in the wrong.\n"
