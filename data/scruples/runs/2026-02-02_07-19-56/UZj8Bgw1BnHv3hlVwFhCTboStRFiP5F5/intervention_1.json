We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for allowing their boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with them. The situation is that the boyfriend got upset about it, saying it looks weird and inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and their boyfriend live together and have the boy every other week. The author has been part of the boyfriend's life for two years. The incident happened when the boyfriend was out; the son crawled up to the author, laid on their chest, and fell asleep. The author allowed it because the son is usually reserved with them and they don't push for physical contact. \n\nThe boyfriend later freaked out, thinking it was inappropriate. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let me break it down. Is there any indication that the author encouraged or initiated this beyond what was appropriate? The son approached them, so maybe it was the child's action. The author allowed it but didn't push. However, allowing a stepchild to cuddle in that way might be seen as inappropriate by some standards, even if the child initiated it. The boyfriend's reaction is about how it looks, which could be a valid concern. In many custody situations, boundaries are important to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Even if the author's intentions are good, the situation could be misinterpreted, especially if they're living together and sharing custody.\n\nBut then again, the child was already in their care every other week. Maybe the author felt comfortable with the child, and the cuddling was a natural expression of the child's need for comfort. The key here is the boyfriend's perspective. He might be overreacting, but his feelings are valid in the sense that he's the parent and responsible for the child. The author might need to consider his concerns, even if they disagree.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? From a strict perspective, if the boyfriend is the parent, the author might be overstepping by allowing physical affection without consulting the parent. But since the author didn't initiate it and allowed the child's natural behavior, maybe it's not their fault. However, they should have considered the parent's possible feelings and perhaps set boundaries to prevent such situations in the future. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they could be seen as inconsiderate of the parent's wishes.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author didn't initiate it and allowed the child's natural behavior, but they should have been more mindful of the parent's perspective. However, the boyfriend's reaction might be excessive. But given that the boyfriend is the parent, the author's actions could be seen as contributing to a situation that the parent finds uncomfortable. Maybe the answer is A (Yes), because even if the child initiated, the author allowed it without considering the parent's feelings. But I'm a bit torn here. The key is whether the author should have known better. If the boyfriend had previously expressed boundaries, then yes. But in this case, the author didn't push it, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The correct answer might be B.\n"
