We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author letting her boyfriend's son cuddle with her while the boyfriend was away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend and the author live together and take turns having the son every other week. The son is 2 years old, but wait, the original question doesn't specify the child's age. Wait, actually, in the original scenario, the user mentions that the boyfriend and she have the son every other week. Wait, but the user's boyfriend has a son. Wait, maybe the son's age is a key factor here. Wait, actually, the original question doesn't mention the son's age, but the user's boyfriend was out for a few hours. Hmm. Maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, in the original scenario, the user says the son \"crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep.\" If the son is a small child, say under 10 years old, then it's a different situation compared to a teenager. But the user mentions that the son has been \"reserved as far as cuddling and such with me,\" which might suggest the child is old enough to be shy but not in the toddler stage. Wait, the original question doesn't specify the son's age. Hmm, that's a problem. The absence of age information could be crucial. Oh, but the user's boyfriend is the father, so the son's age is important to determine appropriateness.\n\nAssuming the son is a young child, say under 10, then letting him cuddle and fall asleep on her chest might not be a big issue. However, the boyfriend is upset because he thinks it's inappropriate. The key here is whether the boyfriend's reaction is justified. The author didn't push the child to cuddle, she allowed it when the child initiated. The boyfriend is upset because it \"looks weird and inappropriate,\" which could be his own insecurities or overprotectiveness. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal boundary here. The boyfriend might feel that even if the author didn't do anything wrong, allowing the child to cuddle like that when he's not present could lead to misunderstandings. However, the author didn't do anything inappropriate, just allowed the child to be comforted. If the child initiated, the author didn't push it, and the situation was innocent, then the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be the issue here, not the author's action.\n\nWait, but if the son is older, say a teenager, then allowing him to cuddle and fall asleep on her chest would be problematic. But the original scenario doesn't specify age. However, the user mentions that the son has been \"reserved as far as cuddling and such with me,\" which could imply a younger child who is shy but now felt comfortable enough to cuddle. So perhaps the son is a small child, and the boyfriend is overreacting. The author's action was to let the child be comforted, which is normal. So the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
