We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her. The situation is that they live together, and the son is with them every other week. The boyfriend came back and got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with the boy's father, and she's been involved in his life for two years. The son crawled onto the couch with her, and she let him sleep there. The boyfriend is upset, thinking it's inappropriate. But the author didn't initiate it; she just allowed it. \n\nI should think about boundaries in step-parent relationships. Usually, step-parents don't engage in physical affection that could be seen as too intimate with the child, but cuddling and sleeping together might be a gray area. However, the key here is that the boy initiated the cuddling, and the author didn't force it. She also didn't push for it. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about how it looked rather than the action itself.\n\nThe boyfriend's accusation of it being \"inappropriate\" might stem from his own insecurities or societal norms about boundaries. The author didn't do anything that crossed into inappropriate territory; she simply responded to the child's need for comfort. Since the child was already in a reserved state with her and this was a natural progression, it's more about the boyfriend's perception.\n\nAlso, the fact that she didn't push for cuddling but allowed it when the child initiated suggests she respected his boundaries. The boyfriend's freak out might be overreacting. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. She acted appropriately given the situation, and the main issue is the boyfriend's reaction, not her actions.\n"
