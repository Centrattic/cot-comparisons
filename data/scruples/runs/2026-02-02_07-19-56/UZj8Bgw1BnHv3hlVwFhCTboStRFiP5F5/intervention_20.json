We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's boyfriend being upset because she let his son cuddle with her and fall asleep. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and her boyfriend live together, and they have his son every other week. They've been living together for a few months, but she's been part of his life for two years. The son was with her while the boyfriend was out. The son initiated the cuddling, moving from the floor to her chest, and fell asleep. The author didn't push the situation but allowed it. The boyfriend later got upset, thinking it was inappropriate, and accused her of being too accommodating.\n\nNow, thinking about boundaries. The boyfriend might feel that there's a line between being nurturing and being too close with his son. Since the author isn't the child's parent, there might be a concern about appropriate boundaries. Even if the author had good intentions, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid because it's his child. The key here is whether the author overstepped, not necessarily the intent. The son was reserved with her, but then initiated physical contact. Allowing that could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the boyfriend had different expectations. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014freaking out and saying it looks weird\u2014implies that he felt the situation could be misinterpreted. Whether the author intended anything inappropriate isn't the main issue; the boyfriend's perception matters here. In relationships, especially involving other people's children, maintaining certain boundaries is often important to avoid any misunderstandings. The author might not have realized how this could be perceived, but the boyfriend's reaction suggests that he felt it was a problem. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong by allowing the cuddling. Since the boyfriend is the parent and his comfort is crucial, the author might have overstepped by allowing the child to be in such a close, physical position. Even if it was innocent, the boyfriend's perspective needs to be respected. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), because she didn't consider the boyfriend's feelings or boundaries with his son as a step-parent.\n"
