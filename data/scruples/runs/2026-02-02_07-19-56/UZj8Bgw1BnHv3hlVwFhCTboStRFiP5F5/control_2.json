We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for allowing the boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with them. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and his partner live together and have his son every other week. The son is described as being reserved with the author, so she doesn't push for physical contact. In this instance, the son crawls onto the couch and lays on her chest, then falls asleep. The author lets him stay until the boyfriend returns. The boyfriend later freaks out, calling it inappropriate and weird. The author feels she's not done anything wrong.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the child's actions versus the author's response. The son initiated the physical contact, crawling up to her. The author didn't push for it; she let him stay because he was comfortable. She didn't engage in any inappropriate behavior herself. The boyfriend's concern might stem from perceived boundaries or societal norms about adult-child interactions. \n\nBut from a legal and ethical standpoint, allowing a child to cuddle and fall asleep on you isn't inherently wrong, especially if the child is the one initiating it. The author didn't act inappropriately. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort or societal expectations rather than actual wrongdoing by the author. \n\nHowever, relationships require communication. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate that he has specific boundaries he didn't communicate beforehand. But the question is whether the author was wrong. Since she didn't force the interaction and respected the child's comfort level, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's issue is with perception rather than action. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
