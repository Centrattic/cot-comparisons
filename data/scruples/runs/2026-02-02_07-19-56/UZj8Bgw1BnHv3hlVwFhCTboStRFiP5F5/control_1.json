      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The situation is about the author letting their boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with them. The boyfriend got upset about it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and their boyfriend live together, and they have his son every other week. The son is 2 years old? Wait, the timeline says they've been present in his life for 2 years, but the current living arrangement is a few months. The son is probably older than 2, but the exact age isn't specified here. Wait, the user didn't mention the son's age. Hmm, maybe that's important. If the son is a child, like maybe 5 or 6, then cuddling on the couch might be more innocent. If he's a teenager, that's different. But the original post doesn't specify. \n\nThe author mentions that the son is usually reserved about cuddling with them. So this was a first time, and the author allowed it. The boyfriend got upset, thinking it's inappropriate. The author didn't push for it; they allowed it when the child initiated. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, if a child is comfortable enough to cuddle with someone, especially when they're in a caregiving role (like a step-parent or partner of a parent), it might be normal. The key here is whether the author crossed any boundaries the boyfriend set. The boyfriend is the parent, so he might have specific rules about how others interact with his child. \n\nBut the author didn't push for the cuddling; the child initiated it. The author didn't encourage or force it. So maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the boyfriend's perspective is that it's inappropriate for someone in a dating relationship with the parent to be in a close physical position with the child. That could be a cultural or personal boundary issue. \n\nIn many cases, parents might not want their partner to be too physically affectionate with their children unless it's appropriate. But if the partner is living with the parent and is part of the household, some physical affection might be expected. The situation here is that the author allowed a spontaneous moment where the child felt comfortable, which might be natural. \n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is about it being inappropriate. Maybe he feels it's too close, or he's uncomfortable with the step-parent dynamic. The author didn't do anything to provoke it; the child started it. So the author might not be in the wrong. However, if there were prior agreements about boundaries with the child, then the author might have breached those. But the post doesn't mention any prior rules. \n\nAnother angle: the author is in a committed relationship with the parent. If the child is used to a certain dynamic and starts to form an attachment, it's okay unless it's overstepping. The parent's discomfort might stem from personal feelings or fears. The author's action was to allow the child to be affectionate, which wasn't pushed but accepted. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they didn't initiate it, and the child's action was natural. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own feelings and boundaries, which might not place the author at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
