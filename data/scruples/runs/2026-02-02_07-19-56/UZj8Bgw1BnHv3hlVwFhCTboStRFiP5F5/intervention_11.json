We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle with her and fall asleep. The boyfriend got upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend and the author live together and have the son every other week. They've been living together for a few months, but the author has been part of his life for two years. The situation happened while the boyfriend was out. The son approached the author and wanted to cuddle, which the author allowed. The boyfriend later reacted negatively, saying it looked weird and inappropriate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did something wrong. From an outsider's perspective, it seems like the son initiated the cuddling, and the author didn't push it. She let him stay until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend's concern might stem from wanting to maintain boundaries between his partner and his child. However, the author didn't force the situation; the child initiated it. \n\nIn terms of appropriateness, if there's no history of inappropriate behavior and the author wasn't trying to overstep, it's hard to see how she's at fault. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own discomfort or overprotectiveness rather than the author's actions. The key here is intent. The author didn't encourage the child to cuddle, she just allowed it passively. \n\nBut I should also think about cultural or personal boundaries. Some people might find it odd for a partner to be that close to the boyfriend's child without the child being their own. However, since the author is in a committed relationship with the father, maybe the boyfriend's reaction is unwarranted. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend feels that his son should maintain a certain level of distance with his girlfriend, even if it's just cuddling, he might have a valid concern. But the author didn't push for the cuddling; she let it happen naturally. The child initiated it, and the author didn't refuse. \n\nI think the main issue here is the boyfriend's reaction rather than the author's actions. Unless there's a prior agreement about boundaries with the child, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She allowed a natural, comforting interaction without overstepping. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
