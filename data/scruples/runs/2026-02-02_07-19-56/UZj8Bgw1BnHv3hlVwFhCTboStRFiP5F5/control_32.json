We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author allowed her boyfriend's son to cuddle with her and fall asleep. The boyfriend got upset, saying it was inappropriate and looked weird.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They live together and have the boy every other week. The boy is used to the author being around, and they've been in each other's lives for two years. The son initiated the cuddling, crawling onto the couch with her. The author didn't push it, just let him stay. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is key here. He's upset about the situation, but the author didn't do it on purpose to make him uncomfortable. The son was already present, and the author allowed a natural, affectionate gesture. The boy was probably feeling safe and comfortable with her. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's perspective might be influenced by societal norms or personal boundaries. But was the author wrong? She didn't instigate it; the child did. She let him stay because he was showing affection. Unless there's a prior agreement that clearly prohibits such interactions, it's hard to say she's at fault. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about how it looked rather than any actual harm done. \n\nAlso, considering that they live together and the boy is part of their shared life, the author might have a valid point in wanting to be affectionate with him. The key question is whether there were any established boundaries. If there were none, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction could be about jealousy or discomfort, but that doesn't mean the author did something wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. The situation is more about the boyfriend's personal feelings rather than the author violating a clear boundary.\n"
