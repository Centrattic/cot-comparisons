We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The situation is that the boyfriend got upset and said it was inappropriate. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend and author live together and have the boy every other week. They've been together a few months, but the author has known the boyfriend for two years. The incident happened when the boyfriend was out, and the son came to the couch. The son crawled onto the couch with the author, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author didn't push him away and let him stay until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend then freaked out, saying it was inappropriate and that the author should have said no. However, when asked if he was accusing her of something, he backtracked and said it just looked weird.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author allowed the child to cuddle with her, which the boyfriend found inappropriate. The question is whether she was wrong. \n\nI should consider child safety and boundaries. Letting a child sleep on someone isn't inherently wrong, especially if they're comfortable. However, the boyfriend's reaction might stem from concern about how it appears, even if he's not accusing her of misconduct. The author might have overstepped if she was in a position that could be misinterpreted, especially since they're not married and she's in a relationship with the father. But since the son initiated the cuddling, and the author didn't push for it, maybe she's not at fault. However, the boyfriend's feelings matter too. Even if the author didn't do anything wrong, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and maybe the author should have considered his perspective. But was it wrong on her part? Or is the boyfriend being overly sensitive? \n\nAnother angle: the child was with them every other week, so the author is part of the child's life. The child might seek comfort from her. However, the boyfriend's reaction could indicate a lack of trust, which is a relationship issue. The author might not be wrong, but maybe she should have discussed boundaries with the boyfriend beforehand. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend's main issue is perception (it looking weird), but there's no actual harm or intent on her part, then maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if allowing the child to sleep in such a position could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if unintentionally, then maybe she is. But given that the child initiated it and the author didn't push him away, it's more about the boyfriend's insecurity or jealousy. The author isn't forcing the situation; she's letting the child be comfortable. So, probably not her fault. The answer would be B.\n"
