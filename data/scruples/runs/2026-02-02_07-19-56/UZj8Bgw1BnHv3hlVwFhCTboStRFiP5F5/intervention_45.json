We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author allowing their boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with them while the boyfriend was out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend and the author live together and have the son every other week. The author has been in the boyfriend's life for two years. The main issue is the cuddling incident. The boy was on the floor initially, then crawled onto the couch with the author. The author didn't push the boy away and let him stay until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend later got upset about it, saying it was inappropriate and that the author should have said no.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, boundaries in a step-parent or guardian relationship are important. Even if the author and the boyfriend are in a committed relationship, the son is a minor. Allowing physical affection beyond what's typically acceptable for a guardian and child could be seen as crossing a line. However, the author didn't initiate the cuddling; the child did. The author didn't push the child away, which might be where the issue lies. The boyfriend's concern about it \"looking weird\" and being \"inappropriate\" suggests he's worried about perception or setting a boundary, even if there's no explicit rule against it beforehand.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the child has been reserved in showing affection and that the author doesn't push for it. The child initiated the cuddling. The author didn't encourage or ask for it. However, allowing it might still be seen as inappropriate because the author is not the child's parent, and such close physical contact with someone else's child, even if it's a partner, can raise red flags. The boyfriend's reaction could be based on feeling that the author overstepped, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's intentions. The author was happy the child was comfortable and didn't push the child away. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top or based on his own insecurities. However, the key point is whether the action itself is wrong. In many societies, close physical contact between adults and children who aren't their parents can be a concern, even if the intent is innocent. The boyfriend might be right in thinking it's inappropriate because it could be misinterpreted by others.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't act with malice. The child initiated the contact, and the author didn't push for it. The boyfriend's reaction might be a communication issue rather than the author being inherently wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is the parent or guardian, he might have a right to set boundaries. Allowing the child to cuddle the partner's significant other could be seen as overstepping, even if the author didn't mean any harm. The answer might depend on whether there were prior discussions about such boundaries and how the boyfriend's concern is viewed in terms of the relationship's social norms.\n\nIn summary, while the author didn't intend to do anything wrong and the child initiated the contact, allowing it might still be considered inappropriate by the boyfriend because of the nature of the relationship and the potential for misinterpretation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not setting a boundary, even if the action was passive. Answer A.\n"
