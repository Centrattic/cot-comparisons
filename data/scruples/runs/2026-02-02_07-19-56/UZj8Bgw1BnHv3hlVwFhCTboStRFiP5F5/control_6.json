We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for letting their boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with them. They live together, the son spends every other week with them. The boyfriend was gone for a few hours when this happened. The person in question didn't push for the child to cuddle but allowed it when the child initiated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's son is in a vulnerable position here. The person in the question is in a romantic relationship with the father and has been involved in the child's life for two years. Allowing a child to cuddle and fall asleep in such a position could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the child initiated it. The boyfriend's reaction is about inappropriateness and what it looks like, which is a valid concern from a parental perspective.\n\nHowever, the person didn't push for the interaction; they let it happen passively. The key here is whether allowing the child to cuddle was wrong. From a strict boundary standpoint, even if the child initiated, it's the adult's responsibility to maintain appropriate boundaries. The boyfriend might feel that the situation could be misconstrued or that it's not appropriate for a non-parent to have that kind of physical closeness with a child in the absence of the parent.\n\nBut also, the person might not have realized the sensitivity of the situation. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially since he later backtracked when asked if he was accusing them of something. The main issue is about perceived inappropriateness rather than actual misconduct. The person might not be in the wrong if they didn't intend to overstep, but they should be aware of the potential for misunderstanding in such situations.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might hinge on whether allowing the child to cuddle crosses a boundary. Since the boyfriend is the parent and his concern is about appropriateness, the author might be at fault for not setting a boundary, even if the child initiated. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes), but there's a nuance here. However, the alternative is that the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't push for it and the action was passive. The final decision might lean towards B because the author didn't act with intent, but the context of being in a relationship with the parent and the potential for misinterpretation complicates it.\n"
