We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend left for a few hours, and his son and the author were at home. The son ended up cuddling with the author on the couch and falling asleep. The boyfriend came back upset, saying it's inappropriate. The author is asking if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the dynamics here. The author and the boyfriend have been together for two years and live together, so they're in a committed relationship. The son is part of the boyfriend's life, and they have custody every other week. The son is probably a child, so maybe around a certain age\u2014maybe a teenager or younger? The question is about boundaries between a girlfriend and her boyfriend's child.\n\nThe boyfriend's main issue is that the son cuddled with the author. He thinks it's inappropriate and that it \"looks weird.\" The author didn't push for it; the son came up to her voluntarily. She allowed it but didn't initiate anything. She was comfortable with the hug, but the son was reserved before. Now, the boyfriend is upset because he feels it's wrong.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, if the boyfriend has boundaries with his son and the author is supposed to respect those, then maybe she crossed a line. But if the son approached her and was comfortable, and she allowed it without initiating, maybe it's not her fault. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own feelings about the situation rather than any explicit rules they had set before. If there were no prior boundaries discussed about how the author interacts with his son, then maybe the boyfriend is being overly sensitive. However, in a relationship, especially involving another person's child, respecting the parent's boundaries is important. The author might have overstepped even if she didn't mean to. The fact that the boyfriend is upset and feels it's inappropriate might mean she should have been more cautious, even if the son initiated. So, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she didn't push the child, and the child initiated the cuddling. But maybe the boyfriend's boundaries need to be respected regardless. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's intention wasn't to do anything wrong. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
