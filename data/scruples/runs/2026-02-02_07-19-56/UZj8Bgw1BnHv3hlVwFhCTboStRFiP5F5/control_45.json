We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her.\n\nFirst, the context: They live together, have the son every other week. The boyfriend was out, and the son climbed on the couch with her, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. She didn't push the kid away and let him stay until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend later got upset, thinking it was inappropriate.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The son was already comfortable hugging her but had been reserved about cuddling. She didn't push for physical contact, so the kid initiated it. She allowed it because he was trying to be close, which might be natural for a child. The boyfriend's issue seems to be about how it looks, not the actual action. But the key here is whether the author overstepped boundaries. \n\nSince the child initiated the contact and she didn't encourage it beyond what the child wanted, it seems she was being nurturing. However, maybe the boyfriend felt it was crossing a line between step-parent and step-child. But in many cases, forming a bond with a stepchild is normal. The problem here might be the boyfriend's discomfort with how it looked, especially if there's a history of tension or if the boyfriend is protective. \n\nBut the author didn't do anything to encourage the child; she just allowed the natural interaction. The main issue is the boyfriend's reaction. So, is the author wrong? If the child approached her and she didn't push it, then no. Unless there were specific boundaries set beforehand that she violated. Since the scenario doesn't mention any prior restrictions, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
