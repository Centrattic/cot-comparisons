We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author allowing their boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her while the boyfriend was away. The boyfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend and the author live together, and they have custody of his son every other week. The son is described as being reserved with the author, so this cuddling might be an exception. The author didn't push for it; the son initiated it. She was okay with it and let him stay until the boyfriend returned. The boyfriend then criticized her for it, saying it looked weird and inappropriate.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. Let's break down the key points. The son crawled up and initiated the cuddling. The author allowed it but didn't encourage it. The boyfriend is upset about the perceived inappropriateness. \n\nFrom a boundaries perspective, the boyfriend might feel that there's a line between being affectionate and being too close. However, the son was a child, and cuddling with a trusted adult might not be inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction could stem from personal discomfort or jealousy, not necessarily the author's wrongdoing. If the author didn't act on any inappropriate intentions and allowed it because the child was being affectionate, she might not be at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend had a history of setting boundaries with the child's interactions, and the author ignored those, then she might be in the wrong. But there's no mention of prior boundaries here. The key is whether the author crossed a line she wasn't aware of. Since the son initiated it and she was okay with it without overstepping, maybe she's not at fault. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own feelings than her actions. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
