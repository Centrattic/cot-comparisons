We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep on her. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and the author live together and have the son every other week. The son is with them for a few hours while the boyfriend is out. The son crawled onto the couch with her, head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author didn't push the interaction; she let it happen naturally. The boyfriend got upset, saying it looked inappropriate and that she should have said no.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she's trying to be a caring partner and co-parent. The son is reserved with her, so this might have been a moment of trust. But the boyfriend is upset about the perceived boundaries. Now, the key points here are about boundaries in a co-parenting situation and how different people view appropriateness.\n\nLegally and in terms of child safety, there's no indication of any wrongdoing here. The son initiated the cuddling, and she didn't encourage it beyond allowing it. The boyfriend's concern might stem from his own discomfort or societal norms about boundaries between adults and children, especially in a blended family. However, allowing a child to seek comfort from a trusted adult is generally normal. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own feelings than any actual harm. The author didn't push for the interaction; she let it happen naturally. So, it's more about communication between the couple rather than the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
