We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for allowing her boyfriend's son to cuddle with her and fall asleep. \n\nFirst, the context: They live together, have the son every other week. The boyfriend wasn't home during the incident. The son initiated the cuddling, moving from the floor to the couch with the author. She didn't push it but allowed it. The boyfriend later got upset, saying it looked inappropriate. \n\nSo, the key points here are the boundaries of the relationship. The author is in a committed relationship with the boy's father, so she's effectively a step-parent figure. Allowing the child to cuddle and sleep with her could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially from the boyfriend's perspective. But the author didn't initiate it; the child did. She allowed it but didn't push boundaries.\n\nHowever, from the boyfriend's point of view, even if the child initiated, having the stepchild sleep with her in a way that could be misinterpreted might cause discomfort. The father might feel protective, and even if there's no malicious intent, the situation could be seen as inappropriate by some standards, especially if others might misinterpret the closeness.\n\nBut the author didn't have any ulterior motives. She was comforting the child, and the child was just seeking comfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own boundaries and possibly his insecurities. The author didn't do anything to provoke it, and the child's action was innocent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because she allowed the child's natural behavior without encouraging anything inappropriate. The boyfriend's reaction is about his own feelings about how a step-parent should interact with their partner's child. However, some might argue that maintaining clear boundaries is important in such relationships to prevent any misunderstandings, even if unintended.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No), because the author wasn't in the wrong. The issue is more about the boyfriend's perspective and his need to communicate his boundaries clearly rather than the author's actions being inherently wrong.\n"
