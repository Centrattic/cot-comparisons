We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a relationship with a boyfriend who has a son. They live together now, and they have the son every other week. The boyfriend wasn't home for a few hours, and during that time, the son cuddled with the author and fell asleep. The author let it happen, and when the boyfriend found out, he freaked out, saying it was inappropriate. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a committed relationship with the father, so there might be some expectations about boundaries with his son. The son is 2 years old, but wait, no, the user didn't specify the son's age. Wait, the user mentioned that they've been present in the boyfriend's life for 2 years, but the son's age isn't stated. Wait, the original post says \"his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor...\" Maybe the son is a child, maybe a teenager or younger. But the author's boyfriend freaks out because of the cuddling. If the son is a minor, like a teenager, there might be different considerations than if he's a younger child.\n\nWait, the original post says the author has been present in his life for 2 years. Maybe the son is a teenager? Or maybe a younger child. Let me check again. The user says \"my boyfriend's son\" and \"every other week.\" If they custody every other week, it's possible the son is a minor child. But the author allowed the son to cuddle and fall asleep on her. The boyfriend's reaction is that it's inappropriate. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nNow, the author says she was lying on the couch and the son was sitting on the floor but crawled up. The son initiated the cuddling, and the author didn't push it. She let him stay until her boyfriend came back. The boyfriend then freaked out, thinking it's inappropriate. The author is confused because the son was already hugging her, but was reserved about cuddling. The author didn't push it, just let it happen because the son initiated.\n\nSo, from a boundary perspective, the boyfriend might feel that allowing his son to cuddle with the author, especially if they're in a romantic relationship, could be seen as crossing a line. If the boyfriend is the father, he might have concerns about his son's relationship with his girlfriend, especially if there's a possibility of inappropriate interactions. However, the son initiated the cuddling, and the author didn't push it. The key here is whether the author had the authority to allow that interaction without discussing it with the boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, if the son is a minor, there's a concern about the relationship between a step-parent figure and a child. However, since the author is in a relationship with the father, maybe the boyfriend is being overprotective. But if the son is a teenager, allowing close physical contact could be seen as inappropriate if it's not approved by the father. The author might not be in the wrong if the son initiated it and she didn't encourage it, but if the boyfriend feels it's inappropriate, there might be issues with boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't seek the boyfriend's permission before allowing the son to cuddle. Even if the son initiated it, maybe the author should have considered the boyfriend's feelings. However, the author didn't push it, just let it happen because the son did it on his own. The boyfriend's reaction of \"freaking out\" might be over the top, but he could have valid concerns about how others might perceive it or about setting boundaries with his son.\n\nIn some cases, allowing a boy to cuddle with another adult (even if it's the father's girlfriend) might make the father uncomfortable. The author might not be in the wrong if she didn't encourage it, but the boyfriend's reaction is about his own feelings and boundaries. So, the answer might depend on cultural or personal boundaries rather than a clear right or wrong.\n\nConsidering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the son initiated it and she didn't push it. However, she might have failed to communicate with the boyfriend about setting boundaries beforehand. But since the situation was a one-time occurrence and the son was the one who initiated, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The boyfriend might need to communicate his boundaries better. Therefore, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
