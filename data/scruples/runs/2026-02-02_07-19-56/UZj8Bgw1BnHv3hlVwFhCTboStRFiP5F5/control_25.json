We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's boyfriend got upset because she let his son cuddle with her and fall asleep. The key points here are the context and the intentions.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and author live together and have the son every other week. The author has been part of his life for two years. When the boyfriend was out, the son crawled onto the couch with her and fell asleep. She didn't push for more physical contact; the son initiated it. She was okay with it and let him stay until the boyfriend came back.\n\nThe boyfriend then freaks out, saying it's inappropriate. He might be feeling possessive or protective of his son, maybe worried about boundaries. But the author didn't push the situation; the child came to her. The son was reserved before, so this was a natural moment of affection. The author didn't do anything to encourage it beyond letting him stay once it happened. \n\nIt seems like the boyfriend is overreacting. The author didn't act inappropriately. She respected the child's initiative and didn't force any interaction. The real issue might be communication between the boyfriend and the author about boundaries with the son. The author's actions don't indicate wrongdoing here. So the answer is B.\n"
