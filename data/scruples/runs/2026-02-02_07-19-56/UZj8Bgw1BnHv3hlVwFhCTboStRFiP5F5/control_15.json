We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about allowing the boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep on her. The boyfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author and her boyfriend live together and have his son every other week. They've been together for a few months, but she's been part of his life for two years. The incident happened when the boyfriend was out, and the son crawled up to cuddle with her on the couch, then fell asleep. The author didn't push it and was okay with it. When the boyfriend came back, he freaked out, saying it was inappropriate and that she should have said no. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The son initiated the cuddling, and the author allowed it. She didn't push it; the child came to her. The boyfriend is upset about how it looks, but the author didn't do anything inappropriate. The child was with them every other week, so it's a regular arrangement. The author's actions might be seen as comforting the child, which is normal, especially if the child is shy or reserved.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is about perceptions and possible boundaries. However, unless there's a prior agreement that the author shouldn't be physically close to the child, her actions don't seem wrong. The child is with them regularly, and the author has been part of his life for two years. Letting a child cuddle and fall asleep is a common, nurturing action. The boyfriend's freakout might stem from his own insecurities or jealousy, which isn't the author's fault.\n\nAlso, the author didn't initiate it; the son did. She allowed it but didn't push it. The boyfriend's accusation of it being inappropriate is more about his feelings rather than an actual wrongdoing on her part. Unless there's a cultural or specific family norm that prohibits this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
