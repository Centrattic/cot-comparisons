We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a live-in relationship with her boyfriend, and they have his son every other week. The boyfriend wasn't home for a few hours, and during that time, his son (the boyfriend's son) cuddled with the author and fell asleep. The boyfriend later got upset, saying it's inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the boyfriend and his son were already in a situation where they live together, and the son has been in her life for two years. The son was reserved about cuddling, so the author didn't push it. When the son came onto the couch, she let him stay and didn't push him away. The boyfriend got upset, thinking it looked weird, but when asked if he was accusing her of something, he backtracked and just said it's inappropriate.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and the boyfriend's feelings. The author didn't initiate the cuddling; the child did. She allowed it, which could be seen as comforting the child, which is normal, especially since they have a relationship. However, the boyfriend's reaction is about appropriateness and how it might look. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the son is a minor, and allowing a child to cuddle for comfort doesn't inherently imply wrongdoing. The boyfriend's concern could be about perceived impropriety, but unless there was explicit inappropriate behavior, like any sexual intent or actions, the author's actions seem okay. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own insecurities or how he feels about the situation rather than the author's actions. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend is the parent, and maybe he has boundaries he wants set with his son and his partner. If the author was aware of those boundaries beforehand, maybe she should have respected them. But the author mentions that the son was reserved, so maybe the cuddling was a one-time thing. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about the perception rather than the action itself. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author didn't do anything that's clearly wrong. She didn't push the child, she allowed a comforting moment, which is normal. Unless there's a history of issues or the boyfriend had previously set strict boundaries that the author ignored, it's hard to see her as wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nSo, probably answer B, No. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
