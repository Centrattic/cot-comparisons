We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a boyfriend's son cuddling with the author while the boyfriend is away. The boyfriend gets upset and says it's inappropriate.\n\nFirst, the author allowed the child to crawl onto the couch and fall asleep. The son was reserved before, so maybe this was a sign of trust. But the boyfriend is upset, thinking it's weird. The author didn't push for cuddling, just let it happen naturally. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the key factors here are boundaries. The boyfriend might feel that the author overstepped by letting the son cuddle. Even if the child initiated it, the author didn't stop it. From the boyfriend's perspective, it might look like they're not respecting his son's boundaries or their own. But then again, the child was already in their care every other week, so maybe some level of affection is normal.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction is key. If he feels uncomfortable, the author should consider his feelings. However, the author didn't have any malicious intent. The situation was a natural occurrence, and the author didn't encourage it beyond allowing it. It's a bit subjective. If the boyfriend had no prior issues, then maybe the author is at fault. But if the boyfriend is being controlling or has unspoken boundaries, maybe not. The author might need to communicate more with the boyfriend about boundaries, but in this specific incident, it's unclear if it was wrong. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because the situation seems to have been a natural interaction without intent to cross a line.\n"
