We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about allowing the boyfriend's son to cuddle and fall asleep with her. The boyfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and her boyfriend live together, and she's been in his life for two years. They have his son every other week. The situation happened when the boyfriend was out. The son initiated crawling up to the couch, and she let him stay there. The boyfriend later freaked out, saying it's inappropriate and looks bad, but then backtracked when she asked if he was accusing her of something.\n\nNow, thinking about boundaries in step-parent relationships. Generally, there's an expectation of appropriate boundaries between a step-parent and the child, especially in physical contact. Allowing a child to cuddle and fall asleep in such a position might be seen as overstepping, depending on cultural norms and family dynamics. However, the author didn't push for the cuddling; the child initiated it. She didn't encourage or push for it, just allowed it to happen.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is understandable if he feels it's inappropriate. But is the author in the wrong? If the child approached her and she didn't push it, maybe she's not entirely at fault. However, from a step-parent perspective, maintaining boundaries is important to avoid any misinterpretation. The key here is whether the author should have set a boundary, even if the child initiated it. If the child is used to physical affection with her, maybe it's okay. But if the boyfriend is uncomfortable, the author might need to adjust her behavior to respect his feelings.\n\nBut the author didn't push it. She allowed the child to stay. The question is whether she should have said no. If the child is young, maybe it's innocent. However, allowing it might cause tension in the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction, while maybe over the top, is about perception. The author might have a point in that she didn't act with ill intent, but she might still be in the right or wrong based on the context.\n\nIn some cases, allowing such physical contact could be seen as crossing a line, even if unintended. But if the child is young (assuming maybe around 5-10 years old), it's more about comfort. The boyfriend's discomfort might stem from others' perceptions. The author's action isn't malicious, but the boyfriend's reaction is valid in terms of relationship dynamics. So the answer might hinge on whether allowing the cuddle was a breach of the expected boundaries, even if unintentional.\n\nGiven that the author didn't push for it but allowed it when the child initiated, maybe she isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have set a boundary regardless. However, the boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own insecurities or how it looks, not her intentions. So, considering all this, perhaps the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I need to be sure.\n"
