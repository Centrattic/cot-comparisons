We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting the boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. The situation is that they live together, the son was with them every other week, and the boyfriend got upset when he found out. The author says the son came onto the couch on his own, and she didn't push it.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The boy is the boyfriend's son, so the author is a partner in a relationship with the parent. The boy was with them for a few hours while the dad was out. The son initiated the cuddling, so the author didn't encourage it but allowed it. The boyfriend then got upset, thinking it's inappropriate.\n\nWhat's important here is the boundaries between a partner's child and the other partner. The boyfriend might feel protective and worried about the son forming an inappropriate attachment or that the author is overstepping. But on the other hand, the author is part of their living situation and has been involved for two years. Letting a child cuddle and fall asleep is a natural gesture, especially if the child is comfortable with her.\n\nThe key points: Did the author act in a way that could be seen as inappropriate? The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on perception. If the author didn't encourage it and allowed it because the child initiated, maybe it's not her fault. However, the boyfriend might feel that as a new partner, she should avoid physical intimacy with the child, especially in his absence. But the author says she doesn't push for it. \n\nIs there a cultural or societal norm that says you shouldn't cuddle a partner's child without permission? That's tricky. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid because he's the parent, but the author's actions might not be malicious. If the child is old enough to initiate it, maybe it's a sign of trust. But the boyfriend's reaction is about how it looks, even if there's no wrongdoing. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? If she didn't push it and allowed it because the child came to her, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own anxiety or boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
