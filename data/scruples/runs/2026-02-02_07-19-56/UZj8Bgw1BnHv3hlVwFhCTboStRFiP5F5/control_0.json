We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a relationship with a boyfriend, and they live together. They have his son every other week. The boyfriend was out for a few hours, and during that time, the son crawled onto the couch with the author, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author let him stay like that until the boyfriend came back. Then the boyfriend got upset, saying it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been in the boyfriend's life for two years, and they live together now. The son has been reserved about cuddling with her before. The author didn't push for the cuddling; the child initiated it. She was lying on the couch, and he came up to her. She felt happy about it because the child has been hesitant before. She didn't do anything to encourage the child beyond letting him stay. When the boyfriend returned, he woke the child up and later got upset. The boyfriend accused the author of allowing something inappropriate, but then backtracked and said it just looked weird and she should have said no.\n\nNow, thinking about boundaries here. The author is in a relationship with the child's father, so the child is her stepson. Allowing a child to cuddle and fall asleep on her chest might be seen as a normal parental or guardian interaction. However, the boyfriend is upset about it. Why? Maybe he's uncomfortable with the physical contact between his partner and his son. There could be cultural or personal beliefs influencing his reaction. Some people might find it inappropriate for a step-parent to have such physical closeness with a child, especially if the child is not their own. However, in many cases, step-parents do form close bonds with their stepchildren, and physical affection is part of that.\n\nThe key points here are intent and context. The author allowed the cuddling because the child initiated it, and she didn't push for it. She didn't act inappropriately; she responded to the child's need for comfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about perception and his own discomfort rather than the author's actions. It's possible that the boyfriend is projecting his own insecurities or has specific boundaries he didn't communicate beforehand. The author didn't do anything to harm the child or cross ethical lines; she provided comfort. The boyfriend's anger might stem from jealousy or a lack of trust, even if he denies it.\n\nAnother angle: the child was with them every other week, so the author is a regular presence in the child's life. Letting him cuddle in a moment of tiredness could be seen as nurturing. The boyfriend's reaction is more about how it looks to him rather than an actual ethical violation. The author didn't do anything wrong by allowing the child to seek comfort. The boyfriend's issue is with how it looks, but unless there's a prior agreement against such interactions, the author isn't at fault. The boyfriend should have discussed his boundaries earlier instead of reacting negatively after the fact.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his own perceptions and possibly unspoken boundaries. The author acted appropriately by allowing the child to seek comfort, especially since he initiated it. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
