We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the author is a girlfriend of someone, and they live together. They have the boyfriend's son every other week. The boyfriend was out for a few hours, and during that time, the son crawled onto the couch with the author, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author let him stay like that, and when the boyfriend came back, he got upset. He thought it was inappropriate and maybe even weird. The author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with the father of the child. So, the child is her boyfriend's son. They live together, and have been in a relationship for a while. The child is used to the author being around, as she's been present for two years. The child approached her on the couch, and she allowed him to cuddle and fall asleep. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she was okay with it because the child is used to hugging her, but had been reserved about more physical contact. She didn't push it, and he initiated it. She thought it was a sweet moment. The boyfriend, on the other hand, got upset, thinking it's inappropriate and looks bad. He accused her of not saying no.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the key points here are the intentions and the context. The author didn't do anything to provoke the situation; the child initiated it. She allowed it because the child was comfortable with her, and she found it comforting. There's no indication that she had any inappropriate intentions. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about how it might look, perhaps due to societal norms or his own discomfort. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the child was under the care of the author and the boyfriend. Allowing a child to cuddle with an adult can be a gray area. Some might argue that it's okay if the child is comfortable and the adult is not being inappropriate. Others might think that boundaries should be set, especially considering the parent's perspective. \n\nBut in this case, the child initiated the cuddling, and the author allowed it, which could be seen as a natural response. The boyfriend's reaction may stem from insecurity or fear of how others might perceive their relationship. However, the author's actions don't seem malicious. She didn't push the child to cuddle; she let it happen because the child wanted it. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a right to set boundaries around how his child interacts with others, especially if he feels uncomfortable. The question is whether the author overstepped by allowing the cuddling without discussing it with him first. But since the situation was a one-time occurrence and the child initiated it, it's debatable. \n\nIn terms of accountability, it's possible that the author could have considered the boyfriend's potential feelings and maybe checked in with him later. However, she didn't have a reason to think he'd be upset unless he had previously expressed such concerns. Since this is the first time he's brought it up, she might not be at fault. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author's intentions, and the child's initiative, it seems like she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his perception and possibly his own insecurities rather than any wrongdoing by the author. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
