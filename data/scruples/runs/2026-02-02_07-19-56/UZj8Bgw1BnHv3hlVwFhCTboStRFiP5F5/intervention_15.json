We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle and fall asleep with her. They live together and have the kid every other week. The situation happened when the boyfriend was out for a few hours. The son crawled up on the couch with her, laid his head on her chest, and fell asleep. The author allowed it, feeling happy because the kid is usually reserved but they do hug. The boyfriend later freaked out, saying it was inappropriate and she should've said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the relationship between the author and the boyfriend, the age of the son, and the context of the situation. The son is 12, which is an age where boundaries are important, especially around sleeping with adults. The boyfriend's reaction is based on it being \"inappropriate\" and \"weird.\" But the author felt it was okay because the kid is shy and they do hug. \n\nI should consider if there's any precedent of the author sleeping with the son before. The author mentions that the son is usually reserved, so this might be a first-time thing. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling protective or uncomfortable with the situation. However, allowing a 12-year-old to cuddle on the couch while the parent is away doesn't inherently imply wrongdoing unless there's a history of boundary issues. The author didn't push the child; the child initiated it. \n\nAlso, cultural norms might play a role. In some contexts, allowing a child to fall asleep on an adult in a non-romantic way is normal. However, in others, it might be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction is key here. If there's no prior agreement about boundaries and the boyfriend feels uncomfortable, that's a valid concern. But the author didn't force the interaction. \n\nThe author's intent seems innocent\u2014she was happy the child felt comfortable. The boyfriend's accusation of inappropriateness might be more about his own discomfort or jealousy rather than an actual ethical issue. However, the question is whether she was wrong. If the boyfriend feels it's wrong, but there's no explicit harm or prior agreement, it's more about their relationship's boundaries. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault if she knew the boyfriend would be upset and didn't consider his feelings. But since it's a new situation and the child initiated it, maybe not. The key is whether the action itself was wrong. Allowing a child to fall asleep while they're present in the home and the parent isn't there isn't inherently wrong unless there's a specific policy against it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author didn't force the interaction and the situation seems to be a boundary issue between her and her boyfriend, not an inherent wrongdoing by her.\n"
