We've only lived together for a few months but I've been present in his life for the last 2 years.\n\nMy boyfriend was out for a few hours and his son and I were watching TV. I was lying on the couch and his son was sitting on the floor, but after a bit, he crawled up on the couch with me and laid with his head on my chest and fell asleep. I was actually pretty happy about it, since he and I hug and such but he's been reserved as far as cuddling and such with me and obviously I don't push it. I let him stay like that until my boyfriend came home.\n\nMy boyfriend woke him up and later freaked out at me because he thinks that it was inappropriate for me to let his son do that and to let him lay on me like that. I asked him if he was accusing me of something and he kind of backtracked and said that it just looks weird and inappropriate and I should've told his son no. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for letting her boyfriend's son cuddle with her and fall asleep. The situation is a bit tricky because it's about boundaries and how each person perceives appropriateness.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The boyfriend and the author live together and have the boy every other week. They've been together a few months, but the author has been part of his life for two years. So, the son knows her, and there's some existing relationship there. \n\nThe incident happened when the boyfriend was out. The son was on the floor, then crawled up to the couch where the author was lying. He laid with his head on her chest and fell asleep. The author allowed this, maybe even found it comforting since the son had been reserved about cuddling. She didn't push him, just let it happen. \n\nThe boyfriend came home, woke the son up, and later freaked out, saying it was inappropriate. He accused the author of letting the son lay on her like that. She asked if he was accusing her of something, and he backtracked to say it just looked weird and inappropriate, she should've said no. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. \n\nSo, considering the dynamics here: the boy initiated the cuddling, the author didn't push it, and the son was comfortable enough to fall asleep. The boyfriend is upset about the perception rather than the actual action, maybe because of how others might see it, or he's uncomfortable with the son being close to her. \n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, the author didn't force the son to do anything. The son approached her, and she allowed it without any intent of wrongdoing. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his own feelings about boundaries and perception. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered his potential discomfort in advance and set boundaries. However, the son was with them every other week, so maybe it's part of their routine. The author might not have thought it was a big deal since the son was just being affectionate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The key is intent. If the author had no intention of overstepping and the son was comfortable, then maybe she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own insecurities or how others might perceive the situation, not necessarily about the son's comfort. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the action itself wasn't harmful, and the son initiated the contact. The boyfriend's issue is more about perception and his own boundaries rather than any real wrongdoing by the author.\n"
