I decided to open it later on my own and just sit and talk to her.\n\nI don't know why but I shared some \"what if\" thoughts with her about breaking up and how our relationship is not necessarily rock-solid from my point of view.\n\nShe obviously was sad and she was speaking in a less-exciting-than-usual tone, I assured her that these are just thought I wanted to share and I'm definitely not thinking about leaving her.\n\nafter a while, she went to her class and I went to my car and decided to open the gift; the gift is a bunch of pictures and probs that represent our memories and some of my favorite things and hobbies; like a movie clapper board with my name written on it because my dream job is to become a director, an owl toy because it's my favorite animal, and a bunch of other stuff and love letters that made me feel like such an asshole, But my intention was never to make her sad, I just wanted to share these thoughts with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I an asshole or is it just a very bad coincidence?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sharing breakup thoughts with his girlfriend right after she gave him a Valentine's gift. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend wanted to meet him, surprised him with a gift. The author decided not to open it immediately and instead talk. During their conversation, he shared some hypothetical thoughts about breaking up, saying the relationship isn't rock-solid from his perspective. She got sad, he reassured her. Then later, when he opened the gift, he felt guilty because it was thoughtful and made him feel like an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the timing and the context. He shared breakup thoughts right after she gave him a gift. That seems really insensitive. Valentine's Day is already a significant day for relationships, and she went out of her way to give him a meaningful gift. Choosing that moment to talk about potential breakups, even as hypotheticals, could be seen as dismissive of her efforts and hurtful.\n\nThe author claims his intention wasn't to make her sad, but intentions don't always matter if the action is harmful. The act of bringing up such thoughts immediately after a gesture of affection and love is likely to be perceived as negative or uncaring. Even if he later reassured her, the initial impact might already have caused pain.\n\nAlso, the gift was clearly made with a lot of thought and love, which makes the timing of his comments even more jarring. It's possible that he didn't consider how his words would affect her emotionally at that moment. Relationships require sensitivity, and this seems like a case where he lacked that.\n\nSo, putting it all together, yes, the author is in the wrong. Sharing breakup thoughts immediately after receiving a heartfelt gift on Valentine's Day is not considerate and likely hurtful, regardless of his intentions.\n"
