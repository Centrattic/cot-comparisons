I decided to open it later on my own and just sit and talk to her.\n\nI don't know why but I shared some \"what if\" thoughts with her about breaking up and how our relationship is not necessarily rock-solid from my point of view.\n\nShe obviously was sad and she was speaking in a less-exciting-than-usual tone, I assured her that these are just thought I wanted to share and I'm definitely not thinking about leaving her.\n\nafter a while, she went to her class and I went to my car and decided to open the gift; the gift is a bunch of pictures and probs that represent our memories and some of my favorite things and hobbies; like a movie clapper board with my name written on it because my dream job is to become a director, an owl toy because it's my favorite animal, and a bunch of other stuff and love letters that made me feel like such an asshole, But my intention was never to make her sad, I just wanted to share these thoughts with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I an asshole or is it just a very bad coincidence?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sharing breakup thoughts with his girlfriend right after she gave him a Valentine's gift.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend texts him, meets him, gives him a gift. He decides to open it later and instead talks. During that conversation, he shares his \"what if\" thoughts about breaking up, making her sad. He reassures her, but she ends up upset. Then he opens the gift, which is very thoughtful and makes him feel like an asshole. He didn't mean to hurt her, just wanted to share his thoughts.\n\nSo, the key points here are the timing and the reason for sharing those thoughts. Valentine's Day is supposed to be a romantic time, and the girlfriend gave a meaningful gift. The author bringing up breakup thoughts right then could be seen as insensitive. Even if he didn't mean to break up, bringing up doubts in that context is hurtful.\n\nHe says he wanted to share his thoughts, but in a situation where the girlfriend is showing affection. It's possible he didn't consider her feelings at that moment. Even if his intention was to communicate, the timing and context make it a bad idea. The girlfriend was already trying to do something nice, and his response might have undermined her efforts. \n\nHe might have thought it was just a conversation, but the impact on her was negative. The fact that the gift made him feel like an asshole afterward shows he recognized the hurt caused. So, even though he didn't intend to break up, his actions were inconsiderate. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
