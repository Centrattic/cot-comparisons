I decided to open it later on my own and just sit and talk to her.\n\nI don't know why but I shared some \"what if\" thoughts with her about breaking up and how our relationship is not necessarily rock-solid from my point of view.\n\nShe obviously was sad and she was speaking in a less-exciting-than-usual tone, I assured her that these are just thought I wanted to share and I'm definitely not thinking about leaving her.\n\nafter a while, she went to her class and I went to my car and decided to open the gift; the gift is a bunch of pictures and probs that represent our memories and some of my favorite things and hobbies; like a movie clapper board with my name written on it because my dream job is to become a director, an owl toy because it's my favorite animal, and a bunch of other stuff and love letters that made me feel like such an asshole, But my intention was never to make her sad, I just wanted to share these thoughts with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I an asshole or is it just a very bad coincidence?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the girlfriend gave him a Valentine's gift, and instead of being happy and showing appreciation, he shared breakup thoughts with her. That seems pretty harsh.\n\nFirst, timing is a big factor. She took the time and effort to surprise him with a gift, which is a significant gesture, especially around Valentine's. Opening it right then might have been a big moment for her. But he chose to open it later and instead talk about breaking up. That's a bad combination. When someone gives a gift, especially in a romantic context, they usually expect positive reactions or at least not immediate doubts about the relationship.\n\nHe says he shared \"what if\" scenarios about breaking up. Even if he meant it as a hypothetical, bringing up breakup thoughts right after a gift is a major emotional letdown. It's like dashing her hopes or making her feel insecure. The fact that she became sad and spoke in a less exciting tone shows the impact of his words. He tried to reassure her, but the damage might already be done. \n\nHe later opened the gift and realized how thoughtful it was, which probably made him feel guilty. But the initial reaction of sharing doubts right after a heartfelt gesture is problematic. The intention wasn't to hurt her, but the action was insensitive. In relationships, it's important to consider the emotional timing and context. \n\nHe might have wanted to be honest, but honesty isn't an excuse if it's delivered in a hurtful way. It's possible that he should have waited for a more appropriate time to discuss his insecurities. The situation is a bad coincidence, but the choice to share those thoughts right then is on him. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
