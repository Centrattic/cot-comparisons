I decided to open it later on my own and just sit and talk to her.\n\nI don't know why but I shared some \"what if\" thoughts with her about breaking up and how our relationship is not necessarily rock-solid from my point of view.\n\nShe obviously was sad and she was speaking in a less-exciting-than-usual tone, I assured her that these are just thought I wanted to share and I'm definitely not thinking about leaving her.\n\nafter a while, she went to her class and I went to my car and decided to open the gift; the gift is a bunch of pictures and probs that represent our memories and some of my favorite things and hobbies; like a movie clapper board with my name written on it because my dream job is to become a director, an owl toy because it's my favorite animal, and a bunch of other stuff and love letters that made me feel like such an asshole, But my intention was never to make her sad, I just wanted to share these thoughts with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I an asshole or is it just a very bad coincidence?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong. The situation is that he shared breakup thoughts with his girlfriend right after she gave him a Valentine's gift. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend went out of her way to surprise him with a thoughtful gift, which shows her effort and care. He decided to open it later and instead talked about his doubts about their relationship. That seems really insensitive. Even though he says it was just to share thoughts and he's not serious about breaking up, timing and context matter a lot here. \n\nThe girlfriend was probably excited and emotional after giving the gift, and his bringing up breakup ideas would naturally make her sad. He might not have intended to hurt her, but the impact is what's important. Choosing to have that conversation right after she gave him a meaningful present, which he later realizes made him feel like an asshole, shows poor judgment. \n\nEven if he had valid concerns, the way and when he brought them up was inconsiderate. The \"what if\" thoughts could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the effort she put into the gesture. It's possible he could have waited for a more appropriate time to discuss any issues without ruining her special moment. \n\nSo, even though he's not intending to leave, the act of bringing up breakup thoughts immediately after a romantic gesture is inconsiderate and hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
