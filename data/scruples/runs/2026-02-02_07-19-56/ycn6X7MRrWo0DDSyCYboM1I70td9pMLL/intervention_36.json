I decided to open it later on my own and just sit and talk to her.\n\nI don't know why but I shared some \"what if\" thoughts with her about breaking up and how our relationship is not necessarily rock-solid from my point of view.\n\nShe obviously was sad and she was speaking in a less-exciting-than-usual tone, I assured her that these are just thought I wanted to share and I'm definitely not thinking about leaving her.\n\nafter a while, she went to her class and I went to my car and decided to open the gift; the gift is a bunch of pictures and probs that represent our memories and some of my favorite things and hobbies; like a movie clapper board with my name written on it because my dream job is to become a director, an owl toy because it's my favorite animal, and a bunch of other stuff and love letters that made me feel like such an asshole, But my intention was never to make her sad, I just wanted to share these thoughts with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I an asshole or is it just a very bad coincidence?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for sharing breakup thoughts with their girlfriend right after she gave them a Valentine's gift. \n\nFirst, the context: the girlfriend went out of her way to surprise him with a thoughtful gift. She probably put a lot of effort into it, given the details like the movie clapper board and owl toy. Then, right after receiving this, the author starts talking about \"what if\" scenarios of breaking up and that their relationship isn't rock-solid. \n\nTiming seems like a big issue here. Sharing doubts about the relationship immediately after a gesture of love and affection can feel really hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014being sad and speaking in a less excited tone\u2014supports that she was upset. The author later tried to reassure her, but the damage was done. \n\nEven if the author's intention wasn't to hurt her, the action was poorly timed. It's one thing to discuss relationship issues when both parties are in a mindset for a serious conversation, but doing it right after a romantic gesture is likely to be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's effort was probably meant to show love and commitment, so bringing up doubts in that moment undermines that effort. \n\nAlso, the fact that the gift made the author feel like an asshole suggests that the girlfriend's intention was pure, and the author's actions clashed with that. The \"bad coincidence\" argument might be a stretch because the author made a conscious decision to share those thoughts at that moment, not just coincidentally being there. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and poorly timed, leading to hurt feelings. They are in the wrong.\n"
