I decided to open it later on my own and just sit and talk to her.\n\nI don't know why but I shared some \"what if\" thoughts with her about breaking up and how our relationship is not necessarily rock-solid from my point of view.\n\nShe obviously was sad and she was speaking in a less-exciting-than-usual tone, I assured her that these are just thought I wanted to share and I'm definitely not thinking about leaving her.\n\nafter a while, she went to her class and I went to my car and decided to open the gift; the gift is a bunch of pictures and probs that represent our memories and some of my favorite things and hobbies; like a movie clapper board with my name written on it because my dream job is to become a director, an owl toy because it's my favorite animal, and a bunch of other stuff and love letters that made me feel like such an asshole, But my intention was never to make her sad, I just wanted to share these thoughts with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I an asshole or is it just a very bad coincidence?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the situation is that the author met his girlfriend for Valentine's Day. She gave him a gift, and instead of being happy, he started talking about hypothetical breakup scenarios. Then he felt bad because he realized the gift was really thoughtful. The question is whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, timing is important. Valentine's Day is supposed to be a romantic time, so bringing up breakup thoughts right when she's giving him a gift seems really insensitive. Even if he meant to just share his thoughts, the timing is terrible. People usually expect positive emotions on such days. \n\nHe says he wanted to talk about his feelings, but doing it at that moment could be seen as dismissive of her effort and feelings. The fact that she got sad and spoke in a less exciting tone shows it hurt her. He tried to reassure her, but maybe the damage was already done. \n\nThe gift was clearly meaningful, and opening it later made him feel worse. But the issue is his choice to bring up those thoughts in that context. Even if he's not planning to break up, expressing doubts about the relationship's stability right when she's showing affection is unkind. \n\nSo, while he might not have intended to hurt her, the action itself was inconsiderate. The key point is the inappropriate timing and context of sharing such thoughts. Therefore, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
