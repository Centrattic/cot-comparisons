We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're in a relationship with their stepsister, which is a result of their parents getting married. They've been together since they were 14 and are now 20. They're both still living at home because they're commuter students, and the parents are trying to break them up by referring to them as brother and sister and making comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social norms. In many places, the legality of a relationship can depend on factors like age of consent and whether the individuals are considered related by law. However, in the case of step-siblings, there's no blood relation, so in most jurisdictions, the relationship might be legal. But even if it's legal, there could be social taboos and family pressures, which is what's happening here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the author's situation makes them the \"asshole\" (AITA). The author is asking if they're wrong for not wanting to break up despite the family issues.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The couple is facing pressure from their parents, but they're both adults and the relationship is consensual. The parents are creating a hostile environment by calling them brother and sister and making negative comments. The author is frustrated by this, and they want to stay together until they can move out. \n\nIs there a moral wrong? If both individuals are of legal age and the relationship is consensual, then perhaps not. However, there might be ethical considerations about the family structure and the parents' roles. But the couple themselves aren't the ones getting married; their parents did, which complicates the family dynamics. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on their lives. The parents are trying to interfere, and the couple is trying to manage their relationship while dealing with this. The author's stance is that they're not the problem, and the parents are the ones causing the conflict. \n\nI also need to think about societal norms. While some people might find the situation uncomfortable, others might argue that as long as both parties are consenting adults, their relationship is their own business. The fact that they were childhood friends and have been together for a long time adds another layer, as it's a long-standing relationship.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family boundaries. The parents marrying each other created this situation, which the children didn't want. The author is in a position where they're caught between their love for their partner and the family's disapproval. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the key points are: consensual relationship, both adults, no legal issues, and the parents are the ones causing conflict. The author isn't forcing anyone; they're trying to maintain a relationship despite external pressures. So, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that the relationship is inherently problematic because of the family ties, even if there's no blood relation. However, step-siblings aren't legally siblings in most places, so that might not hold. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because the relationship is consensual and the main conflict comes from the parents' actions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
