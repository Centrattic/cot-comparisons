We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's also his stepsister because their parents got married. They've been together since they were 14, which is young, but they were both 20 now. They live at home with their parents, and the parents are now trying to push them to break up, calling them brother and sister and making things awkward. The author is conflicted because he wants to stay with her but doesn't want to break up just because of the family situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so at 14 they were underage, but now they're both adults. However, the legality of the relationship might depend on the specific laws regarding incest. Wait, are they considered siblings? The author is his stepfather's daughter, so technically, he's her stepsister. Step-relations aren't typically blood relatives, so incest laws usually don't apply unless there's a blood relation. But some places might have laws against marrying a step-sibling, even if they aren't blood-related. So maybe that's a factor here. I need to check if the relationship is legally permissible.\n\nNext, the social aspect. Even if it's not illegal, there's the social stigma. The parents are trying to break them up by treating them as siblings, which adds pressure. The author feels that the situation is awkward and that the parents are being hostile. They want to stay together, but the situation is making it hard. The key point is whether the relationship is appropriate given their living situation and family dynamics.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. The parents are married now, so their authority over the children might be influencing the situation. The author and his girlfriend are living under the same roof as their parents, which can create conflicts of interest, especially if the parents are trying to control their relationships. This could lead to pressure from the parents, which might affect the couple's autonomy.\n\nAlso, the couple's own feelings. They claim they are happy and want to stay together until they can move out. But the parents' interference is causing stress. The question is whether the relationship is inherently wrong or if the problem is the parents' reaction. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to break up despite the parents' objections.\n\nSo, considering all this, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. If the relationship is legally permissible and both parties are consenting adults, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, there's the aspect of the living situation and potential family dynamics. But since they are both adults and the relationship isn't illegal, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. The parents' actions are the main issue here, not the couple's decision to stay together. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
