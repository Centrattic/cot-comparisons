We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's start by breaking down the key points.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister because their parents got married. They've been dating since they were 14 and are now 20. They live at home because they're commuter students. The parents, especially the mom, are trying to break them up by referring to the girlfriend as his sister. The author's real dad is more dismissive and even a bit cruel, mentioning his ex. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out after graduation.\n\nFirst, legally, the age of consent in most places is under 20, so there's no legal issue here. But morally and socially, there's the question of the familial relationship. The term \"stepsister\" can be a bit confusing here. A stepsister is typically the child of one's parent's new spouse, but in this case, the parents themselves are married, making the girlfriend the author's step-sibling. However, the term \"stepsister\" usually refers to siblings, not a romantic partner. The parents might be using that term to create a sense of familial boundaries.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, relationships with step-relatives can be controversial. Even if there's no blood relation, the perception of incest can cause issues. The parents are using this perception to pressure the couple. However, the couple has been together for so long and doesn't want to break up just because of their parents' actions. They're considering their future and want to move out as soon as possible.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the relationship is consensual and they're in love, but the external circumstances (parents' interference) are causing stress. The question is whether the author is in the wrong regardless of the external pressures.\n\nSome points to consider: The relationship started when they were minors in many places (if 14 is below the age of consent, but the user said they're both 20 now and have been dating since 14. However, in many states, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if they started at 14, there could have been legal issues. But the user didn't mention any legal problems, so maybe they're in a place where it was okay. Alternatively, the relationship has continued past the age of consent. But that's a legal aspect which might not be the focus here.\n\nMorally, the issue is whether it's wrong for them to be in a relationship given the family ties through their parents. Even if there's no blood relation, the step-family connection can be seen as inappropriate by some. The author is defending their relationship as a real romantic one, not just a familial one. They feel that their parents are trying to break them up for their own reasons, maybe jealousy or societal pressure.\n\nThe parents' behavior is questionable, but the question is about the author's responsibility. If the relationship is consensual and they're both adults, some might say it's their choice. Others might argue that the family dynamics complicate things, making it inappropriate. The fact that they can't move out yet adds to the complexity.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for conflict of interest with living under the same roof. The parents' constant belittling could create a toxic environment. However, the couple's decision to stay together despite this might be seen as their right to choose their relationships.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some societies accept step-relatives in relationships if there's no blood relation, while others don't. The answer might depend on the cultural context, but the question is more about general moral judgment.\n\nIn summary, the author is not legally in the wrong if their relationship complies with local laws. Morally, it's a gray area. The parents are pressuring them, but the couple is choosing to stay together. Whether the author is \"in the wrong\" depends on whether the relationship is considered inappropriate due to the family connection, regardless of the circumstances. Some might argue that it's inappropriate because of the family ties, while others might support their love and autonomy.\n"
