We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is that they've been dating since they were 14, are now 20, and their parents got married, making them live under the same roof. They want to stay together until they can move out after college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal unless they're related by blood. Since they're step-siblings through their parents' marriage, there's no blood relation, so legally, it's allowed. Socially, it's a bit of a taboo because of the family connection, but it's not uncommon for people to date someone they grew up with, even if they become stepsiblings later.\n\nThe key points are that they were already dating before the parents married, and their relationship started when they were minors. That might be a point of concern, but since they were in a relationship as minors, that's a different issue. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up now. The parents are trying to push them apart, but the couple is fine and wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nEthically, if the relationship is consensual and both parties are adults now, it's up to them to decide. The fact that they're living together because they can't afford to move out adds to the complexity. However, the parents' interference is problematic. The author is caught between family pressure and his relationship. The question is whether the author's choice to stay together is wrong.\n\nSome might argue that the situation is unusual and could be seen as inappropriate due to the family connection, especially since their parents are now married. Others might say that the couple is in a healthy relationship and shouldn't be forced to break up because of external pressures. The author isn't doing anything illegal, and the relationship was formed before the parents married. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but there are nuances. However, since the question is a yes/no for AITA, the answer is B.\n"
