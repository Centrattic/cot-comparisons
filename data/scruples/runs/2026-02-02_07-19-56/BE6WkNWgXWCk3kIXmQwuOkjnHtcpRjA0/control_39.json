We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend who's also their stepsister. The situation is that they've been dating since they were 14, are now 20, and live at home where their parents got married. The parents are trying to break them up by referring to them as brother and sister and making comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal unless there's a specific law against it. But there's a social taboo because of the family connection, even though they aren't blood-related. The key here is that they were already dating before their parents married, which complicates things. The parents' marriage created the step-sibling relationship, but the relationship existed first.\n\nThen, the living situation is a problem because they have to interact a lot and the parents are pressuring them. The author is struggling with the parents' disapproval but feels the relationship is healthy. The question is whether the author is wrong for staying together despite the situation.\n\nLegally, unless there's a law against it, they aren't breaking any laws. Socially, it's a gray area. Some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the family context, but others might see it as the couple's choice if they're of age and consent. The parents' actions could be seen as trying to manipulate the situation, but the author is choosing to stay with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister, which might be seen as complicating family dynamics.\n\nThe ethical part is tricky. The couple isn't doing anything illegal, but the social implications could be problematic. However, the author is not in the wrong if the relationship is consensual and both parties are adults. The parents' disapproval doesn't necessarily make the relationship wrong. The main issue is the external pressure from the family, not the relationship itself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the relationship is consensual and there's no legal issue. The social stigma and family disapproval don't inherently make the relationship wrong.\n"
