We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister because their parents got married after they were already dating. They've been together since they were 14 and are now 20. They live at home with both sets of parents, which complicates things. The parents started being against their relationship after they got married, even though they were okay with it before. The author is struggling with whether to break up or stay because of the family situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of such a relationship might depend on the specific state laws, especially since they're minors when they started dating. But since they're now both adults, the legal status could be different. However, the question is more about moral or social wrongness rather than legal technicalities.\n\nSocially, there's often a lot of stigma around relationships that are considered incestuous, even if they're not legally prohibited. The parents are using this stigma to pressure them into breaking up. The author feels the relationship is fine, but the external pressure is causing stress. The key points here are consent, the age of consent at the time they started dating, and the impact of family dynamics.\n\nAnother angle is the fact that they were friends first and have a long-term relationship. They plan to move out after graduation. The parents' behavior\u2014calling them brother and sister, lecturing them\u2014might be creating a hostile environment. The author's real dad is dismissive, and the girlfriend's biological mom isn't in the picture, which limits their support systems.\n\nI should also consider the psychological aspect. Being in a relationship when you're living under the same roof as your partner's parent can be challenging. The parents' interference might affect their mental health and the relationship's stability. However, the couple seems committed and not currently experiencing issues in their relationship.\n\nThere's a debate here between the couple's autonomy and the family's disapproval. The author is asking if he's at fault for not wanting to break up. The answer might depend on cultural views and the specific circumstances. In many cultures, relationships that are considered incestuous, even if not legally forbidden, are socially unacceptable, which can lead to significant social pressure.\n\nBut since the couple is in love and plans to move out, maybe the main issue is the external pressure rather than the relationship itself. The author's question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to stay together despite the family's disapproval. If the relationship is consensual and not illegal, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the societal or familial pressure is causing harm, there's a different angle, but the question is about the author's right to be in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. The key factors are consensual, long-term relationship, plans to move out, and no current issues between the couple. The parents' interference is the main problem here, not the relationship itself. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
