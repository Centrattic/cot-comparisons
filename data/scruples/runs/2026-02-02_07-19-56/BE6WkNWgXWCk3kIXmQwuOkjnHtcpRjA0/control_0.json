We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister due to their parents' marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in most places, it's against the law to marry or engage in a sexual relationship with a step-sibling because they are considered close relatives under family law. However, the situation here is a dating relationship, not marriage, but they live together under the same roof. The legality might vary by jurisdiction, but generally, such relationships can be legally permissible once the individuals are adults, depending on local laws. However, there's often a social and familial taboo associated with it.\n\nEthically, the question is more complex. The couple started dating when they were younger, before their parents married. Now that their parents are married, the family dynamics have changed, and the parents are against the relationship. The couple is enduring social pressure from their parents but remains committed to each other. The author feels that the relationship is their own and that their parents are trying to interfere. \n\nThe parents' reactions seem to be based on societal norms and possibly their own discomfort with the situation. The parents might be using labels like \"sister\" to create a sense of family boundary. The couple's argument is that their relationship is consensual and they are in love, and they want to continue until they can live independently. \n\nBut there's a conflict here between the couple's autonomy and the family's expectations. Since they live in the same house, there might be issues of privacy and potential conflicts. The parents might feel that living together in such a relationship could lead to complications, especially with them being in the same home. \n\nIt's also worth considering the power dynamics. The parents are the ones providing a home, and the couple might be in a position where they can't immediately move out. However, the couple's decision is based on their love and commitment, not just convenience. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the relationship is legal and consensual between adults, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong from a legal standpoint. However, socially and morally, it's a gray area. The parents might feel that the step-sibling relationship is inappropriate regardless of the circumstances. The author's perspective is that their personal choice and happiness are more important than the external pressures. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship is legal and consensual, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to continue it. However, the situation is complicated by the family dynamics and the fact that they live under the same roof. The parents might be acting out of concern, even if their methods are harsh. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is a personal one, and if there's no legal violation, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, the situation is ethically complex. The answer would depend on whether the relationship is considered inappropriate in their specific cultural or social context. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and assuming legality is okay, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a strong argument that societal norms could make it seem wrong regardless of legality.\n"
