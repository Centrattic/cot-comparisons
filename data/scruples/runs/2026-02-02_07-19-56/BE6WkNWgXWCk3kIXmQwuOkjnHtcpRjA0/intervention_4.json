We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, are now 20, and live at home with their parents who got married last year. The parents are trying to break them up, calling them brother and sister, and making their lives uncomfortable. The author and his girlfriend want to stay together until they can move out after graduation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms. In many places, step-siblings aren't considered blood relatives, so dating them might not be illegal, but it can be taboo. However, the key here is that they are stepsiblings due to their parents' marriage. Before the marriage, their parents were dating but not married, and the parents were okay with the kids dating. Once the parents married, the dynamic changed. \n\nThe author is in a position where they live in the same household, which complicates things. Living together as a couple with their married parents might be seen as inappropriate by some, especially if the parents are now treating them as siblings. The parents' behavior is definitely a factor here\u2014trying to break them up and making them feel embarrassed.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the question is whether the relationship is wrong regardless of the parents' involvement. The author and his girlfriend are in love, have been together a long time, and don't want to break up because of external pressures. But the fact that they live in the same house as their married parents could be a point of contention. Some people might argue that the living arrangement is the main issue, not the relationship itself. Others might say that the relationship started before the parents married, so it's a situation that's not entirely their fault.\n\nLegally, if it's not a blood relationship, there might not be a law against it. Socially, however, it's a sensitive topic. The parents' marriage complicates the familial relationship, making it feel like a step-sibling relationship even if they weren't before. The author's real sister is mentioned, but the girlfriend is the step-sister now because of the parents' marriage.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for an answer. Considering all factors, the key points are the legal status of their relationship, the living situation, the parents' influence, and societal norms. If the relationship is legal and the couple is in a healthy relationship, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the living situation could be seen as problematic. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong for not breaking up. If the relationship is consensual and healthy, and the issue is external pressures, then maybe not. However, some might argue that the living arrangement is inherently wrong, regardless of feelings.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Given that the relationship was formed before the parents married, and the parents' marriage is the new complicating factor, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem arises from the parents' actions and the living situation. The couple's intention to move out when possible shows they're aware of the situation. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I should check if there's a cultural or legal perspective that might say otherwise. In some cultures, even step-sibling relationships can be frowned upon, but legally it's okay. So overall, the answer is B.\n"
