We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. The situation is complicated because they've been together since they were 14, are now 20, and live at home with their parents who are married. The parents are trying to push them apart by calling them brother and sister and making comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of a relationship between step-siblings depends on the jurisdiction. For example, in some states in the US, it's legal as long as they aren't blood-related. However, even if it's legal, there's the social stigma and family dynamics involved.\n\nThe key points here are that they're not biologically related, their parents are married now, and the parents are using that to create tension. The couple has been together for years and wants to stay together until they can move out. The author feels the situation is being forced upon them by their parents but isn't considering breaking up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the answer could vary. Legally, if it's allowed, there's no legal wrongdoing. Socially, it's a matter of personal ethics. Some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the family structure and potential complications in the future, even if they aren't blood-related. Others might see it as a genuine relationship that's being disrupted by external factors.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't mention any abuse or coercion from the couple's side. They're choosing to stay together out of love and have a plan to move out. The main conflict is with the parents. So, if the relationship is consensual and legal, it's hard to say the author is in the wrong. The parents' actions are causing the conflict, not the couple. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
