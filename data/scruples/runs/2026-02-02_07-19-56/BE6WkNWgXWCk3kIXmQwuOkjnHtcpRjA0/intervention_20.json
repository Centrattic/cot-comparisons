We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they've been dating their stepsister since they were 14, and now their parents just married, making their living situation awkward. They're both 20, still living at home, and can't afford to move out until they graduate. The parents are trying to break them up by referring to them as siblings and making comments. The author is conflicted but wants to stay together.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the relationship is inappropriate regardless of the parents' actions. The key here is the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of a step-sibling relationship depends on whether the parents are married. If the parents are now married, the step-siblings might be considered \"siblings\" in a legal sense, which could make the relationship illegal. For example, in the US, some states prohibit marriage between step-siblings if the parents are married. But even if it's not illegal, there's the social taboo aspect. People often view relationships between step-siblings as inappropriate due to the family dynamic, even if there's no biological relation.\n\nThe author mentions that they were childhood friends turned sweethearts. Starting a relationship at 14 is also a red flag. Legally, depending on the state, 14 might be under the age of consent, especially if there's a significant age difference. But since they're both 20 now, that's probably not the main issue anymore. However, starting it when they were teenagers could have legal implications if they're in a jurisdiction where age of consent or relationship laws apply.\n\nAnother angle is the living situation. They still live with both their parents, who are now married. This creates a conflict of interest and potential for awkwardness, as the parents are trying to influence the relationship. The author's real dad isn't an option due to drug use, and the girlfriend's bio mom is absent. So they're stuck in this situation where their parents are pressuring them to break up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the parents are married and the relationship is considered incest by law, then yes, it's illegal. But if it's not illegal, the social aspect comes into play. Even if it's not against the law, societal norms and the family structure might make it inappropriate. The fact that the parents are trying to break them up suggests that there's a conflict in the household. The couple is fine with each other, but the external pressures are causing issues.\n\nAlso, the author says they want to stay together because they love each other. But the parents' marriage is the new circumstance complicating their relationship. The author's mom calling the girlfriend \"sister\" might be intended to shame them, but the couple is choosing to ignore it. However, the fact that they are living under the same roof might not be a sustainable or healthy situation in the long run, even if they plan to move out after graduation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: If the relationship is legal and the couple is consensual, some might argue they're not the asshole. But the act of dating someone you're considered a sibling to after your parents have married is generally frowned upon, even if it's not illegal. The parents might feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, and the couple is living in a way that could be seen as exploiting a family dynamic. The author is in a tough spot, but the fact that the parents have married is a new factor that complicates the relationship. However, the initial decision to start a relationship when underage and the current legal/social implications might still make it a problematic situation.\n\nI think the answer here is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is likely considered inappropriate given the new family structure, and starting it when they were underage could be a factor. Even if it's not illegal, the social stigma and the parents' marriage create an inherently uncomfortable and ethically questionable living situation.\n"
