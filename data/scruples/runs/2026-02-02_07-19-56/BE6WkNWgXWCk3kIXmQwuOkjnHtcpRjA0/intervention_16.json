We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated. So, the author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister because their parents got married. They've been together since they were 14, which is quite a long time, and they're both 20 now. They're still living at home because they're commuter students, and their parents are married.\n\nThe main issue seems to be the conflict arising from their parents, especially the mother, who is treating the girlfriend as a sister, which is causing tension. The parents are trying to push them apart, even though the couple is happy and wants to stay together until they can move out. The user is asking if it's their fault or if they're doing something wrong by not breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of such a relationship might depend on how the marriage between their parents affects their status. If the girlfriend is indeed a step-sister through marriage, then the relationship could be considered illegal in some jurisdictions because it's a close family relationship. However, if the parents are married, and the girl is the step-sister by marriage, then legally, it's possible that the relationship is prohibited. But this can vary by location, so maybe the user hasn't considered that aspect.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional and psychological impact. The couple is dealing with parental pressure and social stigma from their family. Living under the same roof as their parents, who are married, might create a very uncomfortable environment. The parents are acting as if they're siblings, which complicates the relationship. But the couple wants to stay together, which is their choice, but they might be in a situation where they have little autonomy.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate because of the family connection, even if they're not blood-related. The term \"stepsister\" often carries a familial implication, and the fact that they live together and are being treated as siblings by their parents adds another layer of complexity. However, others might say that the couple's personal feelings and choice should be respected, especially since they're both adults and have been together for a long time.\n\nThe key points here are the legal status of their relationship, the influence of their parents, and societal norms. If the relationship is legal in their area, then it's a matter of personal choice and family dynamics. But if it's illegal, then they might be in a situation where they need to consider breaking up for legal reasons, even if it's difficult.\n\nIn some states in the US, for example, consensual relationships between step-siblings are prohibited because of the marriage of their parents. So if their parents are married, the step-siblings are considered family for legal purposes, making the relationship illegal. In that case, the author might be in the wrong by continuing the relationship. However, if the law in their state doesn't prohibit such relationships, then it's more about personal and family challenges.\n\nThe user might not have considered the legal implications, focusing more on the emotional aspect. The parents' behavior is definitely adding stress, but the core issue is whether the relationship is permissible under the law. If it's legal, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. If it's illegal, then they might be, regardless of their feelings.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the legal status of their relationship. If it's illegal, then the author is in the wrong for continuing it. If it's legal, then it's their choice, and the parents are causing unnecessary problems. The question is whether the relationship is against the law. Since the user hasn't provided specific location details, it's hard to confirm, but assuming that in the US, step-siblings are often considered illegal to marry, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if they're not legally considered siblings, then it's not their fault.\n"
