We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who's also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because their parents got married, making them step-siblings living in the same house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, dating a step-sibling isn't illegal unless it's a half-sibling or full sibling. But here, they were already dating before the parents got married. So maybe the legal status depends on their actual biological relation. If they aren't blood-related, then it's not illegal. However, if they are blood-related, even as step-siblings, there might be laws against it. The user mentions they were friends since childhood and dated since 14, so maybe they're not related by blood. The parents are both divorced and married each other. So the girl's dad married the author's mom, making them step-siblings by marriage but not blood relatives. That might make it legally acceptable.\n\nNext, the social and familial issues. The parents are trying to break them up, creating tension. The author is stressed because of the parents' behavior. The question is whether the relationship is wrong regardless of the external circumstances. The author argues that the relationship is okay, and the problem is the living situation. The parents are pushing them apart, which is causing stress. \n\nEthically, some might argue that being in a romantic relationship with someone you're already close to, especially when living under the same roof, can be problematic. There's a risk of inbreeding if they are blood-related, but if they aren't, that's not an issue. However, even without blood ties, societal norms often frown upon such relationships, especially if they're considered step-siblings by marriage. The fact that they were already dating before the parents married complicates things. \n\nThe author is committed to the relationship and wants to stay together until they can move out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up. If the relationship is consensual, legal, and the couple is happy, then maybe not. But if the situation is causing harm to their mental health or family dynamics, others might say it's problematic. However, the parents are the ones causing conflict, not the couple. The couple is trying to handle the situation by planning to move out. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't wrong if they are not biologically related, the relationship is consensual, and they're working towards a solution. The main issues are the parents' interference and societal judgment, not the couple's relationship itself.\n"
