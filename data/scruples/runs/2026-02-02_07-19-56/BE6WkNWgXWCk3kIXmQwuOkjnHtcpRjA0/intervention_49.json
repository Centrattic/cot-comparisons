We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they've been dating their stepsister since they were 14, they're 20 now, and their parents married, causing tension. The parents are trying to break them up by referring to them as brother and sister and making other comments. The author doesn't want to break up because they love each other and plan to move out after graduating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, in many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, and they're 20 now, so it's not illegal. However, if they're still under 18, it might be illegal, but the question says they're 20, so that's probably not the case. But the relationship is between a step-sibling, which can be a social taboo depending on the context. However, they were childhood friends and sweethearts, so the relationship predates the marriage. The parents' marriage created the step-sibling situation, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, the situation is tricky. The parents are trying to interfere because of their own marriage, which might be complicating things. The couple is in love and doesn't want to break up, especially since they're planning to move out. The author is feeling pressured by the family but is not doing anything against the law. However, some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the family connection, even if it's not illegal.\n\nThe key points are: the relationship was established before the parents married, they're not related by blood, and they plan to move out. The main issue is the family pressure. Legally, there's no problem. Socially, it's a grey area. Some might say it's not the author's fault because they're not the ones who married their parents. Others might think it's inappropriate regardless. The parents' actions in trying to break them up could be seen as the real problem here.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the relationship is considered inappropriate despite the circumstances. Since the author is not breaking any laws and the relationship predates the step-sibling connection, it's more about societal views. However, the AITA community often considers social norms. But in this case, the author is defending their relationship against family pressure, which might not make them the \"wrong\" one. The parents might be the ones acting inappropriately.\n"
