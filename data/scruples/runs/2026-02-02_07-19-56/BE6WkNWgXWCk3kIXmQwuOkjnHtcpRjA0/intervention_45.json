We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is that their parents are now married, making her his stepsister, and the parents are trying to break them up. The couple has been together since they were 14, which is before their parents' marriage. They are both 20 and in college but can't afford to move out yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and social norms. In many places, step-siblings aren't blood-related, so the relationship might not be illegal. However, there's a lot of social stigma attached to such relationships, especially when they start as childhood friends. The parents might be uncomfortable because of the new family dynamics, even if the kids were together before the marriage. \n\nThe author mentions that when their parents were just dating, they were okay with the relationship, but after marriage, they aren't. That's an interesting point. It could be that the parents are now more involved and the situation feels different. The stepmom calling the girlfriend \"sister\" might be a way to create boundaries, but it's also possible she's doing it to push them apart. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, relationships between step-siblings can be complicated due to the family ties. Even if they weren't related by blood, the step relationship can bring its own set of challenges. The couple's long-term relationship might have developed before the step-sibling connection was solidified through the parents' marriage, so their bond is separate from the family aspect. But since they live in the same house, the parents' presence and comments could be causing stress.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if they're not blood-related, it's not illegal. But socially, it's a gray area. Some might argue that it's inappropriate because of the family connection, while others might see it as a long-term relationship that naturally evolved. The couple's desire to stay together until they can move out shows they're aware of the potential issues and are trying to handle it responsibly. \n\nHowever, considering the parents' discomfort and the possible impact on family dynamics, there's a case to be made that the author is in the wrong, especially if the parents are trying to set boundaries. But the couple was together before the parents married, so the initial relationship wasn't based on the step-sibling connection. It's more about the new family structure complicating an existing relationship. \n\nI think the key here is whether the relationship is legal and if the couple is making the best decision for their future. Since they can't move out yet, they're trying to endure the situation. The parents' actions are complicating things, but the couple isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to stay together if they're both consensual and it's not illegal. The author's feelings of being targeted by the parents might be valid, and the parents' push to break them up could be the real issue here. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), but I need to make sure. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards not, because the relationship was formed before the step-sibling connection was solidified through marriage, and it's a matter of family dynamics rather than the individuals' fault. They're also planning to move out once they can, which is a responsible approach.\n"
