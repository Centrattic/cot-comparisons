We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not breaking up with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. The situation is pretty complex. They've been dating since they were 14, so that's a long time. Now they're 20 and living at home with their parents, who are married. Their parents started being okay with it when they were just dating but changed their stance once they got married.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legal age for marriage and consent is 18, but the age of consent for relationships is lower. Since they are both 20, they're of legal age. However, the term \"stepsister\" might imply a familial relationship, but if the parents aren't biologically related to either of them, maybe the step-sibling relationship isn't legally recognized in terms of incest laws. However, this can vary by jurisdiction. Some places have laws against certain familial relationships even if they're not blood-related.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are that the couple has been together for a long time, they're both adults now, and their parents are trying to break them up. The author feels that the relationship is fine, and the external pressure is the issue. The parents are using the \"sister\" label to create tension. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, the perception might be that it's inappropriate due to the family situation, but if there's no legal barrier and both parties are consenting adults, then it's their choice. The author is not in a position where they can move out yet due to financial reasons, so they're enduring the parents' disapproval. \n\nHowever, the fact that they were dating since 14 might raise some red flags. Depending on where they are, there could have been issues when they were minors. But since they're both 20 now, that part is in the past. The current issue is their living situation and parental pressure. \n\nIf the relationship is consensual, and there's no legal restriction against it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents are the ones trying to interfere, which is their own issue. The couple choosing to stay together despite the pressure could be seen as standing up for their relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no legal aspect I'm missing. If in their state or country it's illegal, then the author would be in the wrong. However, the question doesn't specify any legal issues, and the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the analysis seems to lean towards it being their choice as adults.\n"
