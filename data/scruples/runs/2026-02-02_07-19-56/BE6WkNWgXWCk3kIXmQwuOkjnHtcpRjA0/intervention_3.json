We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is complex because they were childhood friends, high school sweethearts, and now their parents are married, making them live in the same house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, in many places, consensual relationships between step-siblings are allowed as long as they are not blood-related. Since they're stepsisters, unless there's a blood relation, it's probably legal. Socially though, there might be stigma because of the family dynamic, especially since they live together. The parents are trying to break them up, which adds pressure, but the couple is in a committed relationship and wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the relationship's validity, the external pressures from the parents, and the couple's intentions to stay together. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but societal norms might judge them. However, the couple is mature and planning for the future. The parents' interference complicates things, but the couple's feelings are genuine. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the relationship isn't illegal, they're in love, and they're trying to handle the situation by planning to move out. The parents' actions are the main issue here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
