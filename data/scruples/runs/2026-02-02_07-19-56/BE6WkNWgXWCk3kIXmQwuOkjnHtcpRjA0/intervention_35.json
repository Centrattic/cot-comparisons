We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is dating his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister because their parents are married. They've been together since they were 14, which is pretty long. Now they're 20 and still living at home, which is the same home as their parents. The parents got married last year, and since then, they've been trying to break the couple up by treating them as siblings and making comments that are supposed to make them uncomfortable. The author feels that their relationship is fine, but the parents are causing problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of such a relationship depends on the specific family ties. If they're step-siblings by marriage and not blood-related, it might be legally permissible. However, even if it's legal, there's the social stigma and the potential for family issues. The parents getting involved actively trying to break them up is complicating things. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up despite these circumstances.\n\nThe key points here are: the couple has been together for a long time, they're not biologically related (since they're step-siblings from their parents' marriage), and they're dealing with family pressure. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but the situation is complicated by their living arrangements and the parents' reactions. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the relationship is consensual and the couple is happy, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents' actions are causing the conflict, not the couple's relationship itself. However, some might argue that the relationship could lead to future issues, especially once they move out and start their own lives. But given that they're young and in love, and the relationship is their choice, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut then again, the fact that they're living under the same roof with parents who are pushing against their relationship might create a problematic dynamic. However, they plan to move out after graduation. Considering all this, the author isn't doing anything wrong per se; the main conflict is from the parents' side. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
