We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is in a relationship with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, and now they're 20. The problem started when their parents got married, making them live under the same roof. The parents are pushing them to break up, calling them brother and sister, which is creating tension. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out after graduation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. In many places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal unless there's a legal relationship that prohibits it. If the parents are married, making them step-siblings, the legality can vary. Some states in the US consider step-siblings as not blood-related, so it's allowed. But even if it's legal, there's the social stigma and the dynamics of living under the same roof.\n\nThe couple's situation is complicated because they live with the parents who are now married. This creates a conflict of interest where the parents might feel protective or have different expectations. The author mentions that their parents were okay with the relationship before marriage but changed after getting married. That's interesting because maybe the parents had a different perspective when they were just dating versus being married.\n\nAlso, the couple is in a long-term relationship, which they've been in since high school. They love each other and want to work through the situation. The main issue here is the external pressure from the parents and the living situation. The author is struggling with whether they should stay in the relationship despite the family's disapproval.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The key points are consent, legality, and the impact of the family's actions. If the relationship is consensual and legal, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the living situation complicates things. Being in a romantic relationship with someone you live with, especially under the same roof as their parents, can lead to family conflicts and social judgment.\n\nBut the author isn't the one who married their stepfather/mother. The parents' marriage created the step-sibling relationship. The couple didn't start the relationship with the intent of being stepsiblings; it evolved after their parents' marriage. So the author's actions might not be in the wrong if they didn't manipulate or deceive the parents. However, the fact that they continued the relationship after becoming stepsiblings could be a point of contention.\n\nIn some cultures or communities, this might be seen as taboo even if it's legal. Social norms vary, so depending on the community's standards, people might judge the couple. But from a moral standpoint, if both parties are consenting adults and the relationship is healthy, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem here is more about family dynamics and parental pressure rather than the couple's relationship itself.\n\nAnother angle is the mental health impact. The author mentions that the situation is driving them crazy, and the parents are trying to break them up. The couple's decision to stay together until they can move out is a reasonable plan to mitigate the negative effects. So, their intention is to resolve the issue once they're financially stable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions in maintaining the relationship, given that it's consensual and legal, don't make them in the wrong. The main issue is the external pressures from the parents and the living situation, which aren't the couple's fault. The answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
