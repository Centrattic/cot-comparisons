We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because they've been together since they were 14, and their parents got married, leading to them living in the same house. The author is being accused of being in the wrong (AITA), and the user wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, in most places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal unless there's a blood relation. Since they're stepsiblings, there's no blood relation, so it's legal. But socially, it can be taboo due to the family dynamic. However, the key issue here is whether the relationship is wrong because of the living arrangement and family pressure.\n\nThe couple has been together for a long time, from childhood friends to high school sweethearts. They're both 20, commuting to college, and living at home because they can't afford their own place. Their parents are trying to break them up by making them feel uncomfortable, calling them brother and sister, and other comments. The author wants to stay with his girlfriend despite the family pressure.\n\nI should think about consent and coercion. The parents are pressuring them, but the couple is making their own choice. The author isn't forced to break up; he's choosing to stay with her. The main argument against him might be that living in the same house with their parents complicates the relationship, but they're not the ones who married, which led to the situation. They're trying to ride it out until they can move out.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. The parents have a different role now that they're married, but the couple is in their own relationship. The parents' actions might be manipulative, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to stay with his girlfriend. The fact that they can't afford to move out yet is a practical issue, not a moral failing.\n\nAlso, considering their long-term commitment and the fact that they've been together since a young age, their relationship isn't a recent development caused by the parents' marriage. The parents' marriage changed the family structure, but the relationship itself is consensual and ongoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the relationship is consensual, legal, and they're dealing with external pressures from their parents. The parents' actions are the main issue here, not the couple's choice to stay together. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
