We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that he's dating his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, and now their parents are married, making them live under the same roof. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to break up, but the family dynamics are stressing him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, it's illegal to marry a close blood relative, but step-siblings aren't blood-related. However, societal norms and family dynamics can complicate things. The key here is whether there's an incestuous relationship. Since they're step-siblings by marriage, not blood, it might not be legally prohibited, but the social stigma is still present.\n\nThe user is 20, and they've been dating since 14. Wait, in most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so starting at 14 might be illegal, depending on the jurisdiction. That's a red flag. If they started dating when they were 14, that could be a problem. The story mentions they're both 20 now, so they've been in a relationship for six years. If the age of consent was an issue when they started, that's a legal problem.\n\nNow, the parents got married when they were in high school, and initially, the parents were okay with their relationship. But after the marriage, the parents changed their stance. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister, etc. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out and get their own place.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The main points to consider are the legality of their relationship (age of consent when they started), the fact that they live in the same house as their parents, and the societal or familial pushback.\n\nIf the relationship started when they were underage, that's a legal issue, making the author in the wrong. If not, then it's more about societal judgment. However, even if legal, the relationship could be considered inappropriate due to the family structure and living situation. But the user is not doing anything illegal now, but the past could matter.\n\nAlso, the fact that they can't afford to move out yet might contribute to the tension. They want to stay together, which is their choice, but the parents are interfering. The parents' actions might be the issue here, not the couple's relationship itself.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, if the relationship started when they were underage, then yes, the author is in the wrong. If not, then maybe not. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. The story says they are 20 now and have been dating since 14. In many places, starting at 14 would be under the age of consent, making their past actions illegal. However, the current situation is about whether they should continue the relationship. If they were underage when they started, that's a past issue. If they are now both adults, the legality might be okay, but the societal aspect remains.\n\nBut the main question is if the author is in the wrong now. If the initial relationship was illegal, then he's in the wrong. If not, then it's more about societal norms. However, the AITA community often considers societal norms and personal ethics, not just legality. Also, living in the same house adds to the complications, making it a messy situation.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) if the age of consent was violated. But if the age is okay, then maybe B (No). The story mentions they were 14 when they started dating. Assuming the age of consent is 16, then they were underage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
