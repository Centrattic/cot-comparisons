We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 20-year-old who has been dating his girlfriend/stepsister since they were 14. They live at home because their parents are married, which makes him her stepdad. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister and making comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, in most places, the age of consent is 16 or lower, so they're past that. There's no legal issue here. But socially, it's complicated. They are step-siblings because their parents are married, but they weren't related by blood. However, depending on the jurisdiction, some places consider step-siblings as close relatives for legal purposes, which might affect things like marriage. But since they're both 20, maybe they can marry if they can get around any legal hurdles. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not if it's legal.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, there's a lot of stigma around such relationships, especially when there's a parental relationship involved. The parents are trying to create a wedge by emphasizing the \"sister\" aspect. The user might be feeling conflicted because of societal norms, but the key is whether the relationship is harmful or not. The article says they're both happy, in love, and want to stay together until they can get their own place. There's no indication that either is being coerced or that the relationship is abusive. \n\nThe problem arises from the living situation and the parents' interference. The author is torn between his feelings and the parents' disapproval. Since the couple is of legal age and the relationship isn't causing harm to others except the parents' disapproval, it's more about personal and social taboos than legal wrong.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because of societal expectations. However, if the relationship is consensual and both are happy, it's not inherently wrong. The real issue is the external pressure from the parents and the living situation. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the relationship itself isn't harmful, even if it's unconventional.\n"
