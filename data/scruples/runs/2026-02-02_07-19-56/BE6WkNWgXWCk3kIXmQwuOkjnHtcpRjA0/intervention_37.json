We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. The situation involves a complex family dynamic where their parents got married, making the girlfriend a stepsister. They've been together since high school and are now in college, still living at home. The parents are pushing for them to break up, calling them brother and sister, and creating tension. The author wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social aspects. In many places, relationships between step-siblings might not be legally prohibited, but there can be social stigma. However, the key here is that the relationship started before the parents married. Initially, the parents were okay with their relationship when they were dating, but after marriage, they changed their stance. The author is facing pressure from parents but the couple is happy and plans to move out once they can.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if the relationship is consensual, not illegal, and both parties are willing to wait until they can live independently, then it's a personal choice. However, some might argue that the family situation complicates things, especially with living together and parental pressure. But the couple's intention to move out suggests they are aware of the issues and plan to address them. \n\nThe author's answer should consider that there's no legal wrongdoing, and as long as both parties are consenting adults, the relationship isn't inherently wrong. The parents' interference might be the main issue here. So, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any cultural or legal factors I'm missing. In some cultures, relationships with step-relatives might be frowned upon more harshly. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not external opinions. Since the couple is committed and plans to resolve the living situation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
