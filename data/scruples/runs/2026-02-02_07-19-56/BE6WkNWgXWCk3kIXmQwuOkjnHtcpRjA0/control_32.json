We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been together since they were 14, now 20, and they're still in high school or college. Their parents are married, so the girl is his stepsister. They live at home, which is the same house as their parents. The parents got married last year, and since then, they've been trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister, making comments, etc. The author and his girlfriend want to stay together until they can move out after graduating.\n\nNow, the ethical or moral wrong here. Legally, in many places, it's about the legal definition of incest. If they're not blood-related, maybe there's no legal issue. But socially and morally, people might have different opinions. The parents are married, so the girl is a step-sibling through marriage, not blood. So maybe there's no legal barrier. However, the fact that they live under the same roof could complicate things. Some might argue that even without blood relation, the social stigma and potential for pressure from family make it a problematic situation.\n\nBut then, the couple has been together since they were young, so there's the aspect of growing up together. Some might say it's their choice if they're both consenting adults. The parents are trying to interfere, which could be seen as the real issue here. The author is against breaking up because he loves his girlfriend and their relationship isn't the problem; it's the external circumstances.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on societal norms versus personal choice. In some societies, relationships with step-siblings are considered taboo, regardless of legal status. Others might focus on consent and mutual feelings. However, since they're both minors (they were 14 when they started dating, now 20), but they are now adults. The fact that they're living under the same roof might also be a factor in terms of social acceptability.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the relationship is consensual and they're planning to move out. However, others might argue it's inappropriate due to the family connection and living situation. But the key is that they are not blood-related, and the main issue is the parents' interference. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
