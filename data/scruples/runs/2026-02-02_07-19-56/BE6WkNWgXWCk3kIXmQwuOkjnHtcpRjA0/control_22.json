We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend, who's also their stepsister. The situation is complicated because they're living with their parents, who married each other after both being divorced. The couple has been together since they were 14, which is pretty young, and they're now 20, still in college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 14 might be below that. If they started dating at 14, that could be a legal issue. But the user says they were high school/college sweethearts, so maybe they are in a jurisdiction where the age of consent is lower? Or maybe they turned 16 before continuing the relationship. Hmm, but the exact legality might vary by location, which isn't specified here.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. They're living under the same roof as their parents, which could be seen as inappropriate due to the family structure. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister and making derogatory remarks. The couple wants to stay together until they graduate and can move out. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up. The parents are creating a hostile environment, but the couple is fine with each other. From a moral standpoint, if the relationship is consensual and both are adults (assuming they're 18 now), then it's their choice. However, societal norms might frown upon it, especially because of the family connection through marriage. \n\nBut wait, the term \"stepsister\" here is a bit tricky. They aren't blood-related, just connected through their parents' marriage. So legally, in many places, relationships between step-siblings are allowed, as they're not blood relatives. However, the fact that they were raised in the same household complicates things. Some places have laws against relationships between individuals who were raised together, regardless of blood relation. So there might be legal concerns even if they're not blood-related.\n\nThe parents' interference adds another layer. They might be trying to protect their own marriage or have their own issues. The author is stressed by their parents' comments and the situation. The couple's intention to move out after graduation suggests they see this as temporary. \n\nIn terms of social acceptance, people might judge them, but the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more about right and wrong rather than social opinion. If there's no legal violation and the relationship is consensual, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if their relationship started when they were underage, that's a different matter.\n\nSo, I need to check if the age of consent is a factor here. If they started dating at 14, and depending on the location, that could be illegal. But the user mentions they're in high school/college, which might imply they're at least 14, but if they're 20 now, they were 14 years old when they started. In many places, 14 is above the age of consent, but some places have different rules. For example, in the US, it's generally 16, but varies by state. If it's 16, then starting at 14 would be illegal. However, the user says they were high school sweethearts, so maybe they're in a place where 14 is legal. Alternatively, maybe they are now 20, so the initial relationship might have been legal if the age is 14 or lower. \n\nAssuming the relationship is legal, then the author isn't in the wrong for not breaking up. The parents' disapproval and the living situation are external factors. The couple is handling it by planning to move out when possible. The key issue is consent, legality, and mutual agreement. If those are in place, the author isn't wrong. However, if the relationship was illegal due to age, then there's a problem. Since the user hasn't provided specific location, but the question is general, maybe the focus is more on the social and ethical aspects rather than the legal. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might say it's inappropriate due to the family connection, but others might argue it's their personal choice. The answer depends on whether the relationship is legal and consensual. Since the user hasn't indicated any non-consensual elements, and they plan to leave the situation, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
