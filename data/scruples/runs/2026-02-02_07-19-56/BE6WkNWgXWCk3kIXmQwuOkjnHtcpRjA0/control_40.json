We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who's also his stepsister. Hmm. First, I need to parse the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the couple has been together since they were 14, now 20. They're both in college, living at home where their parents are married. The parents are against the relationship, starting from when they got married last year. The author and his girlfriend want to stay together until they can move out after graduation. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nI remember that in many places, the legality of such relationships can vary. But the main issue here seems more about social or familial disapproval rather than legal. The parents are making their lives difficult, calling them brother and sister, and trying to undermine their relationship. The couple themselves feels their relationship is fine and the problem is the external circumstances.\n\nNow, the key ethical question is whether the relationship is inappropriate regardless of their feelings. In many cultures, there are taboos around relationships involving siblings or close relatives. But stepsister isn't a blood relation, right? Wait, step-siblings aren't legally considered siblings, so in some jurisdictions, it's not illegal. But socially, people might still have issues with it because of the family dynamic.\n\nHowever, the parents are complicating things by changing their stance after marriage. The couple was okay before the parents got married, but now the parents are against it. The author's real dad is dismissive, and the step-parent situation is causing tension. The couple wants to wait until they can move out, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The main point is whether the relationship itself is wrong. Since they're not blood-related, and if it's legal in their area, maybe not. But if there's a cultural or familial expectation against it, the author might feel pressure. However, the author's stance is that the relationship is fine, and the problem is the parents' interference. The question is about the author's right to continue the relationship despite the family's disapproval.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the relationship itself is inherently wrong. If the law allows it and there's no blood relation, then culturally it's more about personal and family views. The author isn't doing anything illegal, and the couple is choosing to stay together despite challenges. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The parents' actions are the issue, not the relationship itself.\n"
