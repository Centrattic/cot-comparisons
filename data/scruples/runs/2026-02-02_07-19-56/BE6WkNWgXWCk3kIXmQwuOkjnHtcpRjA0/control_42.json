We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a 20-year-old who has been dating his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister, since they were 14. They live at home with their parents, who are married, making the girl his stepsister. The parents got married last year, and since then, they've been trying to break up the couple by calling them brother and sister and making comments about it being inappropriate. The couple is considering staying together until they can move out after graduating.\n\nThe main points here are the legality, social norms, and the couple's feelings. Legally, in many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so since they're both 20, the relationship is legal. However, there's the step-sibling relation. But wait, they were raised by different parents initially. The girl's biological mom wasn't in the picture, and the guy's dad is not part of their current living situation. Now, they live with their parents who married each other, making the girl his stepsister.\n\nSocially, there's a stigma around step-siblings dating, especially if they've lived together or are considered family. But the couple hasn't been living together as a family unit for their entire lives. They were close friends since childhood, became sweethearts in high school/college, and their parents' marriage complicated things.\n\nThe parents are acting against their wishes, trying to break them up. The question is whether the couple is wrong for continuing the relationship. The author is asking if they are in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if there's any legal issue. Since they are both adults, and in many jurisdictions, consensual relationships between step-siblings who are not blood-related are legal. Wait, step-siblings can sometimes be considered legal siblings depending on the jurisdiction, but often the laws vary. For example, in some places, step-siblings are not blood-related, so it's permitted. However, in others, if they were raised together in the same household, there might be laws against it. But the key here is that they are now considered stepsisters because of their parents' marriage. However, if they didn't grow up as siblings under the same roof, maybe that's different. The user says they were childhood friends who became high school sweethearts. Their parents married after they were already dating. So their parents' marriage created the step-sibling relationship, not that they were raised as siblings by the same parents from a young age.\n\nSo legally, if they are not blood-related and their parents married after they were already dating, maybe there's no legal issue. Socially, it's still awkward, but not necessarily wrong. The couple is in love and wants to stay together until they can move out. They aren't doing anything illegal, and their feelings are genuine. The parents are trying to interfere, but the couple's choice to be together isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
