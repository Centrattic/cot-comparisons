We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is a bit complicated. They were childhood friends turned high school sweethearts, living at home with their parents who are now married. The parents started to disapprove once they married, creating tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal, especially if they're not blood-related. Since the parents are married, they are step-siblings, but if they aren't biologically related, it's not a blood relation. However, the social stigma might still be there because of the family structure. The key here is whether there's a legal issue or a social one.\n\nThe user's main point is about the family dynamics. The parents are trying to break them up, using terms like \"sister\" and \"brother,\" and making them feel embarrassed. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out. The question is whether the author is wrong for choosing not to break up despite the family's disapproval.\n\nLegally, unless there's a blood relation, it's not prohibited. Socially, it's a sensitive topic because of the family structure, but the couple's relationship is consensual and they've been together for years. They are both adults (20 years old) and capable of making their own decisions. The parents' interference seems to be the main issue here. The couple is trying to handle their own lives despite the parents' disapproval, which is a common family conflict.\n\nThe answer would hinge on whether the relationship itself is considered inappropriate. Since there's no blood relation and both are adults, it's legally acceptable. The pressure from the parents is more about the family's disapproval rather than the couple's actions being inherently wrong. The author's stance is to maintain the relationship despite external pressures, which is a personal choice within their rights.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The couple's relationship isn't illegal, and they are choosing to stay together despite family opposition, which is their right as adults.\n"
