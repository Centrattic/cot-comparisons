We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. They've been dating since they were 14, which is pretty young, and now they're 20 and in college. Their parents got married last year, so they're living under the same roof again because they're commuter students. The parents started disapproving once they got married, even though they were okay with the relationship when they were just dating. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to break up despite the family situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of relationships can depend on age and whether the individuals are blood-related. Since they're stepsiblings, they might not be blood-related. If their parents are married, then technically they are stepsiblings, but if they were already dating before the marriage, that's a different scenario. However, the legality can vary by location. Some states have laws against relationships between step-siblings regardless of blood relation, especially if they're living together. But since they were already dating before the parents married, that might complicate things legally. I'm not sure, but I need to remember that.\n\nSocially, even if it's not illegal, there's a stigma around relationships that involve a family-like dynamic, especially when they're living together. The fact that they're living in the same house adds another layer because of potential issues of consent and pressure, especially if they're both living under the same roof. The parents are actively trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister and making them feel embarrassed. That could create a tense environment for the couple.\n\nThe couple's perspective is that they love each other and have been together for a long time. They don't see their relationship as problematic and want to stay together until they can get their own place. They feel the pressure is coming from the parents, not their actual relationship. The author is frustrated because the parents' actions are causing stress, but the couple's relationship is otherwise healthy.\n\nHowever, there's a question of whether the relationship is inappropriate regardless of their feelings. Even if they love each other, the dynamic of being stepsiblings and living together might be considered inappropriate by societal standards. There's also the age factor; starting a relationship at 14 is underage in many places, but since they're now both 20, that might not be the main issue now.\n\nAnother point is the impact on their family. The parents' disapproval is causing conflict, which affects the couple's home life. The author's real dad is making jokes about it, which is hurtful. The girlfriend's biological mom isn't involved, and moving in with the author's dad isn't an option due to drug issues. So they're stuck in this situation without support.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the couple's autonomy is a factor. They have the right to be in a relationship if it's consensual and legal. However, the living situation might violate some social norms or laws. If their relationship is considered incestuous by local laws, then it's a legal issue. If not, it's more a matter of social judgment.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If their relationship is legal and consensual, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if there's a legal issue, then maybe they are. But since the parents got married after the relationship started, the status of their step-sibling relationship might complicate things. It's a bit tricky.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer hinges on the legal status of their relationship. If it's legal in their state, then they're not in the wrong. If it's illegal, then they are. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in general, not just legally. Socially, people might judge them, but that's different from being wrong. The key is that the author is in a legally ambiguous or socially frowned-upon situation, but if they're both consenting adults and the relationship is legal, then they're not in the wrong. The parents' actions are problematic, but the couple's choice might be their own.\n"
