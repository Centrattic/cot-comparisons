We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, they were childhood friends and high school sweethearts. They started dating at 14 and are now 20. They live at home with their parents, who are married. The parents initially were okay with their relationship when they were dating, but after the marriage, they started disapproving. The parents refer to them as brother and sister, which is causing stress. The couple wants to stay together until they can get their own place after graduating. The author is asking if they're in the wrong despite the relationship being consensual and long-term.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the legality of a relationship can depend on the specific laws regarding incest. If they're considered siblings by marriage (step-siblings), some jurisdictions might have laws against marriage between step-siblings, even if they weren't raised together. But since they were raised together as step-siblings, that might complicate things. However, if they are of legal age, the legal issue might not be as clear, but there could still be moral or societal judgments.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the situation is complex. The parents are pressuring them to break up, and the couple is trying to endure it. The author is conflicted but wants to stay with his partner. The key points here are consent, the age of the individuals, and the nature of their relationship. Since they're both adults and the relationship is long-term, some might argue that their autonomy should be respected. Others might see the relationship as inappropriate due to the family connection, even if it's through marriage.\n\nThe fact that the parents are married and the couple is living under the same roof could be seen as problematic, especially if there's a power dynamic or if the parents are using their authority to influence the relationship. The couple's desire to stay together until they can move out might be a reasonable plan, but the ethical question is whether the relationship is inherently wrong regardless of their living situation.\n\nIn some cultures or social circles, relationships between step-siblings might be viewed as taboo, even if there's no legal prohibition. The author might face social stigma, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. The core of the issue is whether the relationship is consensual and healthy between two adults. If both are of age and the relationship is mutual, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the fact that they live in the same house and the parents are involved might add layers of complexity, especially if there's any form of coercion or pressure from the parents.\n\nAnother angle is the psychological impact. Living in a household where you're being constantly told your relationship is wrong could affect the couple's mental health. The author might feel trapped, but that doesn't make the relationship right or wrong. The question is whether the relationship itself is wrong, not the pressure from the parents.\n\nIn conclusion, if the relationship is consensual, both parties are adults, and there's no legal prohibition, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The societal and familial disapproval is a separate issue. However, if the relationship is considered illegal in their jurisdiction, then it would be wrong regardless of their feelings. But based on the information given, it's unclear if that's the case. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) if legal and consensual, but if there's a legal aspect, maybe A. But since the user didn't mention legality, and the focus is on moral judgment, it's more about personal and societal views.\n"
