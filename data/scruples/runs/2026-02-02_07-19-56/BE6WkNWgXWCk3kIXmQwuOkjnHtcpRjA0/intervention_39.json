We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is in a relationship with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. They've been together since they were 14 and are now 20, living with their parents who got married. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister and making it uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of such a relationship can vary. But since they're in the same household and there are parental influences, that might complicate things. The parents are actively trying to interfere, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants others' perspectives. The key points here are the long-term relationship, the parents' interference, and their intention to stay together until they can move out. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that it's inappropriate due to the familial connection, especially once the parents are married. However, others might see it as the couple being together out of love and facing external pressures. The parents' behavior is problematic, but the couple's relationship isn't the root issue here. \n\nLegally, if the parents are married and the stepsister is considered a sibling in the household, there might be laws against such relationships. But if they are not blood-related, it's more of a social taboo. The answer depends on cultural norms and legal definitions. Since the scenario doesn't specify the country, it's hard to say. \n\nThe couple's intention to wait until they can move out shows they are trying to address the issue responsibly. The parents' actions are the main problem here. The parents are using their authority to make the situation uncomfortable. \n\nSo, the author's main conflict is navigating the parents' disapproval while staying committed to their partner. They might not be in the wrong if their relationship is consensual and they plan to leave the situation. The parents' interference is the bigger issue. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
