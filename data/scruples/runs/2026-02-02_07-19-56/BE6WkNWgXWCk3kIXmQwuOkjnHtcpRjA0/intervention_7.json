We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because they've been together since they were 14, are now 20, and live at home with their parents who got married, making them step-siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of a relationship between step-siblings can vary. If they're considered legal siblings due to the marriage of their parents, there might be laws against it. But if they were never biologically related, maybe it's different. However, the user mentions they were friends and then dating before their parents married, so the step-sibling relationship came after their relationship started. That might affect the legality depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nEthically, people might have different opinions. Some might say that the close family connection makes the relationship inappropriate, especially if they live under the same roof. The parents are trying to break them up, which adds pressure. The author feels the situation is imposed on them by their parents' marriage, not their own choice. They want to continue their relationship until they can live independently.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong in terms of intent; they love each other and are trying to handle a complicated family situation. The main issue is the social and familial disapproval. However, the fact that they're living in the same house under the same parents could be seen as problematic, even if legally permissible. It's a matter of personal morality versus societal norms.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but others might disagree. The key factors are the legality, the living situation, and the pressure from parents. Since the author is committed to the relationship and sees no fault in it, but the situation is causing family conflict, the answer might hinge on cultural or legal standards. But given the information, if it's legal and the relationship is consensual, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
