We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. They've been dating since they were 14 and are now 20. They live at home with both their parents, who are married. The parents initially were okay with their relationship but after getting married, they started pushing them to break up. The author feels that his parents are trying to break them up, calling them brother and sister, and making them feel embarrassed. They want to stay together until they can get their own place after graduating.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of relationships between step-siblings can vary. But since they are step-siblings, not blood-related, it's generally legal. However, the fact that they live together complicates things. Living together in a romantic relationship while under the same roof as their parents might be seen as inappropriate by some, especially if the parents are trying to separate them.\n\nThe parents' behavior is definitely a point. They changed their stance after getting married, which is odd. The author's real dad has issues with the ex-wife, which adds to the tension. The parents might be projecting their own issues onto the kids. The author and his girlfriend are in a committed relationship, have been since high school, and are planning for the future. They feel pressured by the parents' actions.\n\nSocially, the situation is awkward. While the relationship itself isn't illegal, the fact that they live together and are under the same roof as their parents might be considered unconventional. However, if they are not breaking any laws and the relationship is consensual, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are their age (20), the long-term nature of the relationship, and their plan to move out once they can.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' role. The parents are pushing them apart, which could be seen as manipulative. The author's feelings are valid, and he's not the one causing the conflict. The parents are the ones creating the pressure. The author is in love and doesn't want to break up, which is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main conflict is from the parents, and the relationship is consensual and legal. The author is not the one creating the problem; he's dealing with the parents' interference. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
