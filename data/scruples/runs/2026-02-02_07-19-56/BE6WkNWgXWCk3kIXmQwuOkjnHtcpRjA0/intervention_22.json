We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because their parents got married after they were already dating. The couple has been together since they were 14, which is a long time, and they're both 20 now. They can't afford to move out on their own yet, so they're stuck living in the same house as their married parents.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the age when they started dating, the fact that their parents are now married, and the pressure from the parents to break up. Legally, in many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if they started dating at 14, there might have been some legal issues. But the question is more about moral or social wrongness rather than legality.\n\nNow, the parents married after the couple was already dating. The parents were okay with their relationship when they were just dating but changed their stance after marriage. The parents are now trying to push them apart by calling them brother and sister and making other comments. The couple feels that their relationship is fine and they want to stay together until they can move out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Is it wrong to date a stepsibling? Legally, in many places, it's not illegal unless they're blood relatives. If they're not blood-related, it's allowed. Socially, it's often frowned upon, but the couple's feelings are genuine. The pressure from the family is adding to the conflict.\n\nThe author is not doing anything illegal, and the couple is choosing to stay together despite the circumstances. They're planning to move out eventually. The parents' behavior is problematic, but the couple themselves might not be in the wrong. The fact that the parents married after the couple was already dating complicates things, but the couple isn't the ones who got married first\u2014they were just in a relationship. The parents are using their marriage to create a step-sibling relationship, which is a social construct here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong. The situation is complicated, but the couple is in a consensual relationship, and they have a future plan. The parents are the ones causing the conflict. So the answer would be B.\n"
