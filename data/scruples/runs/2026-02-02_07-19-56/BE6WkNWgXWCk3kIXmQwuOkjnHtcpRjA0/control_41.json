We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend who's also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because they've been together since they were 14, they're both 20 now, and they live at home where their parents are married. Their parents started dating after they were already in a relationship, and now the parents are trying to break them up.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In many states, the age of consent is 16 or 18. Since they're 20, it's definitely legal. But there's also the question of family relationships. In some places, it's illegal to marry your step-sibling, but dating might not be. The legality might depend on the specific state's laws. The user mentioned they're in a state college, but the exact state isn't specified. However, even if it's legal, there's the social aspect.\n\nSocially, the situation is awkward because they live under the same roof as their parents who are married. The parents are making it difficult by calling them brother and sister and trying to shame them. The author feels that their parents are trying to drive a wedge between them. The key here is that the relationship itself isn't causing issues in their own eyes\u2014they're saying they're fine and want to stay together.\n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, relationships between stepsiblings can be a taboo topic. Some people might find it inappropriate, but others might see it as just another romantic relationship. The fact that they were childhood friends and grew up together complicates things because there's a family connection. However, the author is not in the wrong if the relationship is consensual and legal. The parents' interference seems to be the main problem here, not the couple's relationship itself.\n\nAlso, the question is about whether the author is wrong for not breaking up. The couple is choosing to stay together despite the external pressures, which suggests that their relationship is healthy. The author's reasoning is that they love each other and don't want to end the relationship because of their parents' actions. Unless there's abuse or coercion, it's their right to decide.\n\nI should also consider the living situation. They can't afford to move out yet, so they're stuck in a house where the parents are against their relationship. This adds stress but doesn't make the relationship wrong. The answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong because the relationship is consensual, legal, and the couple is together by choice, despite external pressures.\n"
