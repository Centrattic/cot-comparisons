We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. They've been dating since 14 and are now 20, living at home with their parents who are married. The parents started disapproving after getting married and are pushing them to break up. The author and his girlfriend want to stay together until they can move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of such a relationship might depend on specific laws. But since they're 20, if they're of age, maybe it's not illegal. However, social norms might still view it as taboo, especially when they live under the same roof. Living together in the same home as their parents might complicate things, even if they're not married. \n\nThe parents' behavior is causing tension. The author mentions that his mom calls the girlfriend \"sister\" to provoke him, and the dad makes jokes about it. The parents are trying to break them up. The couple wants to stay together until they can leave. The author loves the girl and doesn't want to break up because they're both happy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer could go either way. On one hand, the relationship started before the parents got married, so maybe the parents' marriage added a new layer of conflict. On the other hand, they're in love and have a long-term relationship. \n\nI need to consider ethical viewpoints. Some might argue that the situation is inappropriate due to the familial relationship through marriage, even if they weren't related before. Others might say that if the couple is happy and the relationship is consensual, it's their choice. Also, the parents' disapproval could be exacerbating the problem, making it a family conflict rather than the couple's fault.\n\nThe key factors here are the legality (if applicable), the consensual nature of the relationship, and the external pressures from the parents. Since the couple is of age and the relationship is consensual, some might argue they're not in the wrong. However, the stepsister aspect might still be seen as problematic by some. But given that they were childhood friends and long-term partners before the parents married, the dynamic is more about the existing relationship being complicated by the parents' marriage. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong if the relationship is legal, consensual, and the couple is happy. The main issue is the parents' interference and societal judgment. Therefore, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
