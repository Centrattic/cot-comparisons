We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is that they've been together since they were 14, they're 20 now, live at home with their parents who are married. Their parents started opposing the relationship after getting married, and the author and his girlfriend want to stay together until they can get their own place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social aspects. In many places, consensual relationships between step-siblings are legally permissible. The key here is that step-siblings aren't blood relatives, so it's not incestuous in a legal sense. But there's a social taboo because of the family structure. However, since they were already dating before the parents married, the legal status might still hold. \n\nThe question also revolves on the parents' interference. The parents are trying to create a wedge by calling them brother and sister, which is a common tactic to make the relationship feel inappropriate. The author argues that the relationship itself is healthy, and the issue is external pressure from the parents.\n\nMoral and ethical considerations: Some might argue that the living situation complicates things, but the couple isn't forced to live together; they're living there because they can't afford to leave yet. They're planning to move out after graduation. The author isn't in the wrong if the relationship is consensual, both parties are adults, and they're not violating any laws.\n\nHowever, there could be arguments about the power dynamics if there's any, but the scenario doesn't mention any abuse. The main conflict is the parents' disapproval. The key points are that both are adults, the relationship is consensual, and they have plans to resolve the living situation. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
