We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister due to their parents' marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of a relationship between step-siblings can vary. If their parents are married, they might be considered step-siblings, but the laws about incest can differ. If they were already dating before the marriage, that might affect the legal standing. However, the user hasn't provided specific location, so I can't be certain. But generally, if the marriage is recent and they were already in a relationship before, it might not be legally prohibited, but socially it's still a taboo.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. Even if it's not illegal, societal norms often frown upon such relationships, especially when there's a family connection. The parents are clearly against it, which adds pressure. The author mentions that the parents are trying to break them up by labeling them as siblings and lecturing them. The author feels the situation is forced by external circumstances, not their own choice. They were childhood friends and long-term partners before the parents married.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author loves his girlfriend and doesn't want to break up despite the family issues. They plan to stay together until they can move out. The question is whether the relationship is wrong regardless of their feelings. The key point here is consent and the nature of their relationship. They were together before the parental marriage, so the step-sibling status is a result of the marriage, not their initial relationship.\n\nHowever, living in the same household complicates things. Co-habitation with family members who are pressuring them might create a hostile environment. But the author is choosing to endure it for their relationship. The parents' interference is a significant factor here, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to stay with someone they love, especially if they were together first.\n\nOn the other hand, societal and familial pressures are real, and even if the relationship is consensual and legal, it's still a sensitive topic. The author's justification is that the relationship is between two people who've been together for years, and the family situation is an external factor. So, whether they're in the wrong depends on cultural and personal ethics. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" it's subjective. But given that they were together before the marriage and the relationship isn't forced by the family but by their own choice, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
