We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. The situation involves a complex family dynamic where the couple has been together since high school, are now in college, and their parents married, leading to them living under the same roof. They're facing pressure from their parents to end the relationship, but the couple wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, the legality of a relationship depends on blood relation and age. If they're stepsiblings, meaning they have different biological parents and are related by marriage, it's not a blood relation. So legally, in most jurisdictions, that's allowed. But it's important to check the specific laws, but since the question is about morality rather than legality, maybe that's not the main focus here.\n\nEthically, societal norms often view relationships with stepsiblings as taboo, even if it's not illegal. The taboo comes from the potential for family complications and the fact that they were raised together, which might lead to conflicts of interest in the family structure. However, the couple is in love and has been together a long time. They're not the ones who married their parents; that's an external factor they had no control over. They tried to stop their parents from dating because of the potential issues but couldn't prevent it.\n\nThe parents are now making their lives difficult by referring to the girlfriend as a sister and trying to break them up. The couple is under pressure from both sides of the family. The author feels that the situation is being forced upon them, and they're trying to maintain their relationship despite the external pressures. They have a valid reason to stay together (until they can move out), and they're not breaking any laws.\n\nConsidering all that, while society might frown upon it, the couple isn't inherently in the wrong. They're dealing with circumstances beyond their control. Their commitment to each other and their plan to move out in the future suggests they're trying to navigate the situation responsibly. The parents' actions are arguably more problematic, as they created this situation by marrying each other after the couple was already together. The couple's desire to stay together isn't malicious; it's about maintaining their relationship against external pressures. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
