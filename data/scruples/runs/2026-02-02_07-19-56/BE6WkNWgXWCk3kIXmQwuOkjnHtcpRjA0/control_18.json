We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's okay for them to continue dating their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister, given their living situation and the pressure from their parents.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: They've been dating since 14, which is pretty young. Now they're 20 and in college but still live at home because their parents are married, making them step-siblings. Their parents started being okay with the relationship when they were just dating but changed their stance after marriage. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister and making it awkward. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out after graduation.\n\nSo the main issue is whether it's inappropriate for them to continue the relationship given their current family status. Legally, if they're step-siblings by marriage (since their parents are married), that might affect the legality in some places. But the question is more about morality and social acceptability. \n\nIn many cultures, relationships between step-siblings can be controversial, especially if they live together. The fact that they were already in a relationship before their parents married complicates things. Some might argue that they were in the relationship first, so the step-sibling status is a result of their parents' marriage, not their own choice. Others might say that once the parents are married, they're now considered siblings in a legal or social sense, making the relationship taboo.\n\nHowever, the couple is in love and has a history together. They can't afford to move out yet. The parents are trying to push them apart, which adds pressure. The question is whether the author is at fault for not breaking up. \n\nIf the relationship is purely consensual and both parties are adults, some might say it's their choice. But the living situation where they are in the same house could be seen as inappropriate due to the potential for conflict and the family dynamic. However, the couple isn't doing anything wrong in terms of their feelings; it's the situation they're in that's causing the issue.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' role. The parents married, which created the step-sibling relationship, so maybe the parents are at fault for not considering the children's relationship before getting married. But the question is about the author's actions. \n\nSince they are both adults and the relationship existed before the parents' marriage, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to continue. The problem is more about the external circumstances and the parents' interference. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (No), as the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to stay with the person they love, despite the family situation.\n"
