We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, and now their parents are married, making them technically step-siblings. The parents are trying to break them up and call them brother and sister, which is causing tension. The author wants to stick with his girlfriend until they can move out and get their own place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, relationships between step-siblings aren't legally prohibited because they're not blood relatives. However, there might be social stigma or family disapproval. The key here is whether the relationship is consensual and there's no coercion involved. Since they've been together since high school, it seems like it's mutual.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on their living situation. They live with their parents, and the parents are actively trying to disrupt their relationship. The author mentions that the parents are using terms like \"sister\" to unsettle them. This could be creating a hostile environment at home. The author's stance is that they're fine as a couple and just want to wait until they can move out.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the familial context, even if they're not blood-related. Others might say that since they're not related by blood and there's mutual consent, it's their choice. The parents' behavior is problematic, but does that shift the blame onto the author?\n\nAlso, the age factor: they started dating at 14, which in some regions could have been under the age of consent, making the relationship illegal. But the current situation is them being 20 now. If the relationship started when they were minors, that's a different issue. However, the question is about their current situation, not past legality.\n\nThe author is conflicted between his feelings for his girlfriend and the external pressures from his parents. The core issue is whether the relationship is inappropriate regardless of the circumstances. If the law doesn't prohibit it and both parties are consenting adults, then the author isn't in the wrong. The parents' actions are the main problem here.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The relationship is consensual between adults, and the external pressures from the family are the root of the conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
