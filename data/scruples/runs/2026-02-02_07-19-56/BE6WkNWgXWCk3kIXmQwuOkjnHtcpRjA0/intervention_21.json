We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, which is pretty young, and now they're both 20, still in college, living at home because their parents are married. The parents started off okay with the relationship but once they got married, they started pushing the couple apart, calling them brother and sister, and making it difficult. The author is conflicted because he's in love with her and doesn't want to break up, but the living situation is stressing them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality here. In many places, the legal age of consent and the laws around close relationships vary. But since they're 20, and in the US (assuming from the context), the age of consent is 18, so legally, it's okay. However, some states might have laws about close family relationships, but stepsiblings aren't blood-related, so that's probably not an issue. So legally, they're fine.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. They were childhood friends turned high school sweethearts. The parents didn't like the idea when they first started dating, but let it be, and then after marriage, started disapproving. The parents are using their authority to create tension, which isn't helpful. The author is trying to maintain the relationship despite the parents' interference, which is tough.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he and his girlfriend are happy, and the problem is external (parents trying to break them up). He doesn't want to break up because he's in love and they plan to leave the house after college. So, is he wrong for not wanting to break up?\n\nOn one hand, he's in a relationship with someone he loves, and it's not illegal. On the other hand, the parents are involved and creating a hostile environment. The question is whether the relationship is inappropriate regardless of their feelings. The fact that they were close in age and had a long relationship might make some people uncomfortable, but others might see it as a long-term commitment.\n\nThe author's real issue is the parents' interference and the living situation. They can't leave yet because of financial reasons. So, the problem isn't their relationship per se but the external pressures. The author is trying to maintain his relationship despite the challenges. \n\nI think the key here is that the relationship itself isn't inherently wrong if it's consensual, legal, and both parties are happy. The parents' actions are problematic, but the author isn't doing anything unethical by staying with his girlfriend. So the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. However, some people might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the stepfamily dynamic, even if it's legal. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh the arguments.\n\nAnother angle: societal norms. Some might say that being in a relationship with your stepsister is unusual, but others might not see it as an issue. Since they were already dating before the parents married, maybe the parents are the ones complicating things. The author isn't the one who created the situation; the parents' marriage did. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the relationship is consensual, legal, and the main conflict is the parents' interference. His desire to stay together despite the challenges isn't unethical. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
