We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 20-year-old who is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister because their parents are married. They've been together since they were 14, which is pretty young, but they've been through high school and college together. Their parents married after the two were already dating, and now the parents are trying to break them up by referring to the girl as his sister and making other comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the legality of a relationship depends on the age and whether there's a legal barrier, like being blood relatives or step-siblings. Since they're step-siblings, not biological siblings, the legal stance might differ. Some places consider step-siblings as family, so relationships might be prohibited, but others don't. However, since the parents got married after the relationship started, the step-sibling status is a result of their parents' marriage, not biological ties. That might be a key point here.\n\nEthically, there's the question of whether it's appropriate for two people in the same household to be in a romantic relationship. They live at home with both parents, which complicates things. The parents are trying to create a rift by labeling them as brother and sister. The author feels the relationship is fine but the external circumstances (parents' actions) are making it hard. They plan to stay together until they can move out and get their own place.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, relationships that start in adolescence can face challenges as they age, but since they've been together for years and are committed, that's a factor. The pressure from family members, especially when the parents are trying to undermine the relationship, adds external stress.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking others' views. The core question is whether the relationship is inappropriate regardless of the parents' actions. Some might argue that the step-sibling relationship, even if not biologically related, is problematic due to family dynamics. Others might see it as a consensual relationship between adults who plan to separate once they can, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the parents' role: they married after the relationship was already established, which the kids had previously begged them not to do. The parents' actions now seem to have created the situation, which could shift responsibility away from the author.\n\nLegally, if the relationship is not prohibited by law in their jurisdiction, then the author isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, it's more subjective. If society generally accepts that step-siblings are not considered family for the purpose of relationships, then the author might not be wrong. However, if their community or cultural norms frown upon such relationships, even if legal, it could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on legal definitions and societal norms. If the relationship is legal and both parties are adults, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, the external pressures from family and the potential psychological impact could be factors. The key is whether the relationship itself is considered inappropriate regardless of the circumstances or if the parents' interference is the main issue.\n"
