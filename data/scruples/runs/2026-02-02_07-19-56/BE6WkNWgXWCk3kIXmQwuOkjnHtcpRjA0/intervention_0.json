We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who are also step-siblings because their parents married. They've been together since they were 14, living at home, and now the parents are trying to break them up. The question is whether it's inappropriate for them to be dating under these circumstances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of relationships between step-siblings can vary. But more importantly, socially, there's a stigma around such relationships, especially when they start at a young age. The couple is still in high school/college, which is considered a formative period. \n\nThe user mentions they were childhood friends turned sweethearts. That could blur the lines between appropriate and inappropriate relationships. However, the key issue here is the living situation\u2014living with their parents and being referred to as siblings, which adds to the ethical dilemma. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the relationship is consensual and both parties are happy, the external pressures from family and the potential for coercion or undue influence from parents could be a problem. Also, the fact that they were 14 when they started dating might be a red flag, depending on local laws regarding the age of consent and close-in-age exemptions. \n\nBut the couple is now 20 and planning to stay together until they graduate. The parents' interference is complicating things. The writer is conflicted between their love and the family dynamics. The main question is whether the relationship is inherently wrong regardless of their feelings. \n\nI think there's a difference between being in the wrong legally versus socially. Legally, it might not be a crime if it's allowed by their jurisdiction, but socially, there's a taboo. However, the user's main query is about being in the wrong, which is more about social morality. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms. In some cultures, step-sibling relationships are more accepted, but in many others, they're not. Since the original post is in English and the scenario is typical in Western contexts where such relationships are generally frowned upon, the answer might lean towards \"A\" (in the wrong). But I need to verify if there's any nuance I'm missing here. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were 14 when they started dating could be an issue. Even if they're both of age now, starting at such a young age when they might not have fully developed emotional maturity could be a point against them. Additionally, the fact that they live together under the same roof with parents who are trying to break them up might create a conflict of interest and emotional pressure. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer is probably A. The relationship is in a gray area, but the societal and familial context suggests that the author is in the wrong due to the circumstances, even if their intentions are good.\n"
