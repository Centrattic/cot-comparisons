We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're in a relationship with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister because their parents got married. They've been together since they were 14, which is pretty young, and they're now 20. They live at home because they're commuter students, and their parents are making things difficult by referring to the girlfriend as their sister and trying to break them up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and societal norms. In many places, step-siblings aren't considered blood relatives, so the relationship might not be illegal. However, there's a social stigma attached to it, especially since they live together. The age of consent is probably not an issue since they're both adults now, but the fact that they were dating since 14 when they were minors might be a point. If they were underage, then it could have been illegal, but now that they're adults, maybe it's more about social acceptability.\n\nThe author mentions that their parents were okay with the relationship when they were dating but changed their stance after the parents married. That seems like a conflict of interest because the parents' new marriage complicates the dynamic. The author and their girlfriend want to stay together until they can move out, which seems like a practical solution, but the parents are pressuring them.\n\nThe key points here are consent, legality, and social norms. If the relationship is consensual and not illegal, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the fact that they live together in the same house with their parents might be a problem. Some places have laws against cohabiting step-siblings if it's considered incestuous, depending on local laws. I should check if that's the case, but since I don't have specific location info, I have to go with general knowledge.\n\nIn some states, step-siblings can legally marry, so if that's the case, their relationship might be legal. However, the social stigma and the parents' interference are causing tension. The author's reasoning is that they love each other and want to stay together until they can move out. If the relationship is legal and both are consenting adults, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that their parents are now married and the relationship is causing family conflict could be a factor.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. The parents are using their authority to try to break up the couple, which is manipulative. The author is resisting that pressure, which could be seen as standing up for their relationship. But if the parents are trying to protect their children from a problematic situation, that's another perspective. However, the couple claims they are fine and the parents are the ones creating issues.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the relationship is legal and consensual. If it is, then the author isn't in the wrong. The parents' behavior is problematic, but the couple's choice to stay together might be their right. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
