We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who are also step-siblings because their parents married, leading to a complicated living situation. They've been together since high school, now in college, living at home. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister and making comments.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of marriage between step-siblings depends on the jurisdiction and specific definitions. For example, if they are not blood-related, it's often legally allowed, but socially it's taboo. However, the story is about a romantic relationship, not marriage yet. So, the legality might not be an issue here.\n\nSocially, people might judge because of the living situation and the step-sibling connection. The parents are trying to create a wedge by labeling them as brother and sister. The couple, however, are in love and want to stay together until they can get their own place. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to break up.\n\nThe main factors here are consent, mutual agreement, and external pressures. Both are adults, the relationship is consensual, and they are aware of the circumstances. The parents' disapproval isn't making it wrong per se. The author's stance is that their relationship is healthy despite external pressures. \n\nHowever, the living situation being the same home could complicate things. But since they are both adults and in a consensual relationship, it's their choice. The author isn't engaging in anything illegal (assuming step-sibling isn't blood-related) and the relationship is based on mutual love. The parents' attempts to break them up might be seen as overstepping, especially if the couple is happy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
