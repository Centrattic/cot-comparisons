We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. They were childhood friends, became high school sweethearts, both 20, and have been dating since 14. They live at home with their parents, who are married. Their parents got married last year, and since then, they've been pushing them to break up, calling them brother and sister, etc. The couple wants to stay together until they can get their own place after graduating.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider legal and social factors. In many places, the legal age of consent is 16 or 18, but since they were 14 when they started dating, that might be a problem. However, in some jurisdictions, there are close-in-age exemptions. But the user's country isn't specified, so maybe the focus is more on the social aspect rather than legality. Also, in some places, relationships between step-siblings might not be legally prohibited, unlike biological siblings.\n\nSocially, there's a taboo around step-siblings dating, but the situation here is complicated because they were childhood friends and have a long-term relationship. The parents are creating conflict by referring to them as brother and sister, which adds pressure. The couple is dealing with external pressures from the parents but are otherwise happy. They plan to move out after college.\n\nThe key factors here are consent, legality, and the impact of external pressures. If the relationship is legal (no biological relation, above age of consent in their jurisdiction), then the author isn't in the wrong. The parents' actions are problematic, but the couple's choice to stay together isn't inherently wrong. The author is not in the wrong because they are in a consensual relationship, even if it's under family disapproval. So the answer is B.\n"
