We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. The situation is that they've been together since high school, now at college but still living at home because their parents are married. The parents started disapproving after getting married, even though they were okay with the relationship when they were dating. The author feels the parents are trying to break them up by referring to the girlfriend as \"sister\" and making negative comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and social norms. In many places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal, but it can be a taboo. However, the key here is that they aren't blood-related. The parents' marriage is the reason they're now step-siblings, which complicates things. The couple is in a long-term, committed relationship and doesn't want to break up. The parents are interfering, creating a hostile environment. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal. The problem is the external circumstances caused by the parents' marriage. The couple is trying to handle it by staying together until they can move out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up. Since the relationship is consensual and not harmful, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No). The parents' actions are problematic, but the couple's decision to stay together despite the situation isn't their fault.\n"
