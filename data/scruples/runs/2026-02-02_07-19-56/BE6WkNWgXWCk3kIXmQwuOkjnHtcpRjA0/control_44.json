We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, which is pretty young, but they were childhood friends first. Now they're both 20 and living at home with their parents, who are married. The parents, especially the mom and the girlfriend's dad, are trying to push them apart by referring to them as siblings and making comments that are meant to be uncomfortable. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out after graduating and getting jobs. They feel the situation is being forced by their parents, and they're not happy with the pressure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legality and social norms around relationships with step-relations. In many places, the legality of such relationships can vary. For example, in some jurisdictions, it might be legal to date a step-sibling as long as they aren't blood relatives, but social acceptability can be another matter. Since the parents are married, making the girlfriend his stepsister, the couple is likely not blood-related, which might make it legal. But the key here isn't just legality but whether it's considered wrong in a moral or social sense.\n\nThe couple has been together for a long time, so their relationship is long-standing. They were friends before becoming a couple, which could add to the complexity. The fact that their parents are married now complicates their living situation, and the parents are actively trying to break them up by using familial titles and other tactics. The couple is under pressure from their parents, but they feel the relationship is healthy and don't want to end it just because of the parents' disapproval.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are creating a hostile environment, which is probably very stressful for the couple. The author feels that their relationship is fine and that they want to stay together until they can move out. The parents are using their authority and the living situation to pressure them, but the couple is trying to maintain their relationship despite that.\n\nSocially, relationships with step-relations can be controversial, even if not illegal. Some people might see it as inappropriate because of the family context, but others might argue that if there's no blood relation, it's a personal choice. The fact that they were already in a relationship before the parents married each other might make it more complicated, as the parents' marriage created the step-sibling status rather than the other way around.\n\nThe author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the relationship is consensual and they are not blood-related. The pressure from the parents is a separate issue. The author's decision to stay in the relationship is his personal choice, and unless there are legal issues (which the question doesn't specify), it's more about personal and family dynamics. The parents' behavior is problematic, but that doesn't automatically mean the author is wrong for wanting to stay with his girlfriend.\n\nSo, based on that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The key points are the consensual nature of the relationship, the lack of blood relation, and the external pressure from the parents rather than the relationship itself being inherently wrong.\n"
