We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is that they've been together since high school, live at home with their parents who are now married, and the parents are trying to break them up. The author is conflicted because of the living situation but wants to stay together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, step-siblings are not blood relatives, so in most places, it's not illegal to date them. However, societal norms might view it as taboo because of the family structure, even if there's no biological relation. The key here is that the parents are married, making the girl technically the author's stepsister.\n\nThe author mentions they were friends since childhood and became a couple later. They're both 20, planning to stay together until they can move out. The parents are pressuring them to break up by calling them brother and sister. The author feels the parents are being unfair and are trying to push them apart.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legality standpoint, he's not. Socially, people might have different opinions. Some might say that even though it's not illegal, the family dynamic makes it inappropriate. Others might support their decision to stay together if they're happy and the relationship is consensual.\n\nThe parents' actions are complicating the situation. The author isn't doing anything wrong by choosing to stay with his partner if they're both willing. The real issue here is the parents' interference. Since the couple isn't breaking any laws and their relationship is consensual, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
