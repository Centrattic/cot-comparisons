We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because they live with their parents, who are married. They've been together since they were 14 and are now 20, planning to ride it out until they can get their own place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and societal norms. In many places, relationships between step-siblings aren't legally prohibited because they aren't blood relatives. However, the emotional and social aspects are tricky. They were friends since childhood, became romantic, and their parents' marriage created this situation. The parents are actively trying to break them up, which adds pressure.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent, legality, and the impact of external pressure. Since both are adults, the relationship isn't illegal. They're both in agreement and committed. The real issue is the family dynamics and the parents' interference. \n\nHowever, there's a potential conflict of interest regarding their living situation. They live under the same roof as their parents, which could lead to awkwardness or ethical concerns, but as long as both parties are consenting and happy, it's their choice. The parents' disapproval might stem from societal stigma or their own discomfort, but that doesn't necessarily make the relationship wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship is consensual and legal, then the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the living situation complicates things, even if they're not at fault. However, the user's intention is to see if they're in the wrong for continuing the relationship, not for the situation itself. Since they're both adults and in agreement, I think the answer is B.\n"
