We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who have been together since they were 14, now 20, and are also a step-sister relationship because their parents got married. They're living at home, and the parents are trying to break them up by referring to them as brother and sister and making comments. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of marriage depends on age and consanguinity. Since they're step-siblings, they're not blood-related, so marriage might be legal if they're of age. However, societal norms might still view this as inappropriate, especially because they live under the same roof. The parents' interference adds another layer here.\n\nThe key points here are consent, age, and the living situation. Both are adults, have been together for years, and are not blood-related. Legally, there might not be an issue. However, the living situation complicates things. They are in a household where their parents are pushing for them to break up, which creates a conflict of interest and potential pressure.\n\nSocially, some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the family dynamic, even if it's not illegal. The fact that their parents are now married and using their relationship against them could be seen as manipulative. The couple's desire to stay together until they can move out seems reasonable, as they are working towards independence.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if it's allowed, then no. Socially, opinions vary, but the couple isn't harming anyone. The parents' actions are problematic. The author is not the asshole because they are in a consensual relationship and trying to maintain it despite external pressures. The real issue is the parents' interference and manipulation.\n"
