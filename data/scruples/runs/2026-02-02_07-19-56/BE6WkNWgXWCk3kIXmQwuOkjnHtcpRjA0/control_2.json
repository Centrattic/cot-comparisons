We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend who is also his stepsister. The situation is that they were childhood friends, became high school sweethearts, and now live with their parents who got married, making the girl his stepsister. Their parents are trying to break them up, calling them brother and sister, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the relationship is actually inappropriate. The key points here are the legal and social definitions. In many places, being step-siblings by marriage doesn't legally prohibit a relationship, especially if they weren't blood-related to begin with. The parents married after the couple was already in a relationship, so the step-sibling status is a result of the parents' marriage. \n\nThe author mentions that the parents were okay with the relationship when they were dating but changed their stance after marrying. So the legal status of the relationship as \"step-siblings\" depends on whether the parents' marriage created a legal sibling relationship. If the step-siblings aren't blood-related, then there's no blood relation issue. However, in some cultures or social contexts, people might frown upon such relationships even if they're not blood-related, especially if they live under the same roof.\n\nAnother angle is the living situation. They live at home with both parents, which is common for students. The parents are trying to break them up, which adds pressure. The author and his partner are considering staying together until they can move out. The question is whether the relationship is inherently wrong regardless of their feelings.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's no blood relation, it's allowed. Socially, it's a gray area. Some people might find it unusual due to the parents being married, but others might see it as a long-term relationship that's not biologically related. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite the parents' disapproval. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not necessarily if the relationship is legal, but if it's morally or socially wrong.\n\nThe parents' actions (labeling them as brother and sister, making it awkward) might be trying to create social pressure. The author's stance is that the relationship is fine and the issue is the external circumstance. The community's response to AITA (Am I the Asshole) posts often considers intent, harm, and social norms. If the couple isn't causing harm and are in a consensual relationship, the community might side with them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be B (No), because the relationship isn't inherently wrong if there's no blood relation, and the couple is in a consensual, long-term relationship. The parents' disapproval doesn't make the couple wrong, especially if they plan to move out and continue once they can.\n"
