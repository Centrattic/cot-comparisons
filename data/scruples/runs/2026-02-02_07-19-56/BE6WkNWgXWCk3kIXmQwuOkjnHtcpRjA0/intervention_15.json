We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister because their parents are married. They've been together since they were 14, now 20. They live at home with their parents, and the parents are trying to break them up. The author asks if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal, but it can be considered taboo or inappropriate depending on cultural norms. The age of consent is a factor here. Since they started dating at 14, which is underage in most places, that's a legal issue. However, the current situation is them being 20, so maybe the legality isn't the main point now.\n\nThe parents' reaction is part of the problem. The parents married each other after both being divorced, which complicates family dynamics. The author's real dad has issues with the mother, calling her a \"crazy bitch,\" which adds to the tension. The parents are pushing for them to break up, using the label of \"sister\" to create distance.\n\nThe author is conflicted because he loves his girlfriend and doesn't want to break up, but the living situation is causing stress. They can't move out yet due to financial constraints. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up.\n\nLegally, if they're 20, there's no law against it. Socially, it's a gray area. Some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate because of the familial connection, even if they aren't blood-related. The fact that they were dating since 14 raises concerns about the appropriateness of the relationship's start, especially if they were minors when it began.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that the relationship is healthy and the issue comes from their parents. The parents are creating conflict by labeling them as siblings and trying to separate them. The author's stance is that they want to stay together until they can move out.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the relationship itself is wrong. Since there's no legal prohibition now, and the relationship is consensual between adults, some might side with the author (B). Others might argue that the familial connection is problematic regardless of legal standing, making the author at fault (A). The key points are the legal age when the relationship started and the social/ethical considerations of a step-sibling relationship. However, since they are now adults and the relationship is consensual, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents' actions are the main issue here. So the answer might be B.\n"
