We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend who's also their stepsister. The situation is complicated because they've been together since they were 14, live at home with their parents who got married, and the parents are trying to break them up.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In most places, consensual relationships between step-siblings who are not related by blood aren't illegal. But there might be social or familial implications. The key here is that they're not blood-related, which is important because incest laws vary but often target blood relatives.\n\nThe author mentions that they and their girlfriend are fine, but the parents are pressuring them. The question is whether the relationship is inappropriate given the living situation and family dynamics. The parents are trying to create distance by calling them brother and sister, which is a social strategy to make the relationship feel uncomfortable.\n\nEthically, if both parties are consenting adults and there's no forced relationship, many people might argue that it's their choice. However, the fact that they live in the same house complicates things. Co-habiting with a partner and their parents can lead to tension and discomfort, but the author wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nThe parents' behavior seems harmful, pushing them to break up. The author feels the situation is unfair, given their long-term relationship and mutual love. The answer hinges on whether the relationship is considered inappropriate in societal norms, but since they're not blood-related and it's consensual, many would say the author isn't in the wrong. The parents' actions are the real issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
