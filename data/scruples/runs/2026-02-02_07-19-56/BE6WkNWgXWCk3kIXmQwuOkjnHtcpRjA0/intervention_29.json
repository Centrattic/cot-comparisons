We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're dating their girlfriend, who is also their step-sister because their parents got married. The parents are trying to break them up, and the couple wants to stay together until they can get their own place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, dating a step-sibling isn't illegal unless they're blood relatives. Since they're step-siblings, there's no blood relation, so legally it's allowed. Ethically, some might argue it's inappropriate because of the family dynamic, especially living under the same roof. But others might say that if both people are consenting adults and the relationship is healthy, it's their choice.\n\nThe couple has been together for a long time and plans to stay until they can move out. Their parents are the ones creating tension by calling them brother and sister and making negative comments. The parents' behavior is problematic here, not necessarily the couple's relationship if it's consensual and healthy.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but maybe that's because of societal norms. However, the key factors are the legality, consent, and the health of the relationship. Since all these seem to be in order, the author isn't in the wrong. The real issue is the parents' interference and the living situation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
