We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. So, first, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe key points are: they started dating when they were 14, are now 20, have been in college for a while, and still live at home. Their parents got married after being divorced, which caused their relationship to become a stepsister situation. The parents are against the relationship, calling them brother and sister, and creating a hostile environment. The couple wants to stay together until they can get their own place after graduating.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, in most places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal. But culturally and socially, it's a sensitive issue because of the family dynamics. However, the relationship itself isn't inherently wrong if both people consent and are adults. The problem here seems to be more about the external pressures from the parents and the living situation rather than the relationship itself.\n\nThe user might be considering societal norms. Some people might argue that the situation is complicated because of the family ties and the potential for judgment. But the couple's feelings and their desire to stay together until they can become independent could be seen as valid. They aren't the ones forcing their parents to marry, so it's an external factor. Also, the parents' behavior is antagonistic, which might not reflect on the couple's relationship quality.\n\nAnother angle is the living situation. They can't move out yet, so the pressure from parents is making their home life difficult. The author is conflicted but doesn't see breaking up as the right solution since they are happy together. The question is whether their choice is wrong, which likely isn't the case. The answer would hinge on whether the relationship itself is problematic, which it isn't if both are adults and consenting. The parents' actions are complicating things, but the couple isn't at fault for being in a relationship.\n"
