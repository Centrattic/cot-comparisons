We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he's dating his girlfriend, who's also his step-sister because their parents are married. They've been together since 14, are currently 20, and living at home with their parents. The parents got married last year, and that's when the conflict started. The parents are trying to break them up, calling them brother and sister, and making it hard for them. The couple wants to stay together until they graduate and can get their own place.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if there's anything legally wrong. In many places, step-siblings aren't considered blood relatives, so the relationship isn't illegal. But there might be social or familial taboos. The question is about moral or ethical wrongness, not legality. \n\nEthically, relationships between step-siblings can be controversial, especially if there's a close age difference and long-term bonding. However, the key factors here are the couple's consent and their living situation. Since they're both adults now, even though they started dating young (14), they're now 20 and presumably of legal age to make such decisions. The fact that their parents are married complicates things because it's a family dynamic that's causing tension.\n\nThe parents' disapproval is significant. The mother is trying to alienate them by addressing the girlfriend as a sister, and the father is dismissive. The couple feels pressured but are committed to each other. They're planning to move out once they can afford it. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The question is whether their relationship is inappropriate regardless of their feelings. If the relationship is consensual, both parties are adults (now), and there's no coercion, then it's not inherently wrong. The main issue is the family's reaction and the living situation. However, some might argue that the relationship is problematic due to the familial connection, even if they're not blood-related. \n\nBut step-siblings aren't blood-related, so the taboos are less about biology and more about social norms. The couple's feelings and their intention to separate once possible could be seen as reasonable. The parents' actions are causing the conflict, not the couple's relationship itself. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main problem is the external pressure from the parents and the living situation. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
