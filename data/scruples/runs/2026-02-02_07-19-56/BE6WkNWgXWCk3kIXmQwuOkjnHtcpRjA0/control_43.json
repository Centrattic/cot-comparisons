We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's appropriate for him to not want to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister, given their living situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships. The author and his girlfriend are childhood friends, high school sweethearts, dating since 14. They're both 20, still in college, and live at home with their parents, who are married. So, the author's mom is married to his girlfriend's dad. Both parents were previously divorced before getting together. When they were dating, the parents were okay with their relationship, but after getting married, they started pushing them apart, calling them siblings, etc.\n\nThe author feels that the situation is being used against them by their parents. He loves his girlfriend and wants to stay together until they can move out. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to break up despite the family dynamics.\n\nLegally and socially, relationships between step-siblings can be a gray area. In many places, it's not illegal unless they are blood-related. Since they are step-siblings, it's more about family dynamics. The main issue here is the parents' disapproval and the living situation. The author argues that their relationship is healthy, and they want to wait until they can live independently.\n\nI need to consider if the relationship itself is inappropriate, regardless of the parents' opinions. Since they were friends first and have been together a long time, their relationship is based on a long-term connection. The fact that they can't move out yet might be a practical problem, but not necessarily a moral one. The parents' interference is creating tension, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for being in a relationship that's consensual and based on their own feelings.\n\nHowever, some might argue that being in a romantic relationship with a stepsister, even if not blood-related, can complicate family dynamics. But the key point is whether the author is doing something wrong. If the relationship is consensual, and they're both adults (they are 20), then it's their choice. The parents' actions are the main problem here, not the author's decision to stay together.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B: No, the author is not in the wrong. The situation is complicated by family issues, but the relationship itself isn't inherently inappropriate if both parties are consenting adults.\n"
