We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're in a relationship with their girlfriend, who's also their stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, and now their parents got married, making their living situation complicated. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out, but their parents are trying to break them up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social norms. In many places, the legality of such relationships might depend on the age and the specific laws of the state or country. Since they're both 20 and in a state college, the legal age of consent isn't an issue here. However, some jurisdictions have laws against relationships between step-siblings, especially if they live together. But the post doesn't mention any legal issues, so maybe it's not a factor here.\n\nSocially, there might be stigma involved. The parents are pressuring them, calling them brother and sister, which is causing emotional stress. The couple feels it's their choice since they're both adults and the relationship is consensual. The key points here are consent, mutual agreement, and the impact of external pressures.\n\nThe parents getting married created this situation, and the couple's parents are now trying to break them up. The author is frustrated because the parents are making the relationship uncomfortable. The couple's intention is to stay together until they can move out and live independently. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, as long as both parties are consenting adults and there's no coercion, the relationship might be considered their personal choice. However, living together as a couple in the same house under the same parents could create complex dynamics, even if they're not the ones initiating the situation. The parents' behavior is clearly trying to disrupt the relationship, which adds another layer.\n\nI should also consider if there's any conflict of interest or potential harm. The parents' actions might be harmful, but the couple hasn't indicated any harm from their side. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up. Since the relationship is consensual and they're planning to leave the situation, it's more about personal choice. Unless there's legal issues, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the power dynamics or parental influence could be a factor, but the couple seems to be making their own decisions despite the pressure.\n"
