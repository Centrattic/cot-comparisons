We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if it's appropriate to date their stepsister, considering their living situation and the pressure from their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The couple has been together since high school, they're both 20, and they're currently in college but living at home with their parents who got married, making the girlfriend the author's stepsister. The parents are against the relationship now, especially after getting married. The author feels the pressure from the parents to break up, but they want to stay together until they can move out.\n\nI should consider the legality. In most places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal unless they are blood relatives. Since the parents are married, they're not legally related, right? So the relationship isn't illegal. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. Some people might find it awkward because they're in the same household and the parents are pushing for separation. But the couple isn't related by blood, so the societal judgment might be more about the living situation and family dynamics rather than the actual relationship itself.\n\nThe parents' behavior seems to be a big part of the problem. They started okay when they were just dating but changed after marriage. That could be a factor in the stress the couple is feeling. The parents are trying to create distance by calling them brother and sister, which is probably intentional to make the relationship uncomfortable.\n\nAnother point is the couple's intention to stay together until they can move out. They're planning to leave once they graduate, which gives them a clear end goal. As long as they're not violating any laws and they're both consenting adults, their relationship is their own choice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship is consensual, legal, and they're both adults, then the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stay with their partner despite external pressures. The parents' disapproval doesn't necessarily mean the relationship is inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong because the relationship is legal, consensual, and the couple is planning to move out once they can. The pressure from the parents is part of the family dynamics, but the couple's choice to stay together isn't wrong in itself.\n"
