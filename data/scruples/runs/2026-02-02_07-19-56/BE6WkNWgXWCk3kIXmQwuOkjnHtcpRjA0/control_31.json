We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend who's also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because they live with their parents who are married, and the parents want them to break up. The main question is whether their relationship is inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, consanguineous relationships (blood relatives) are illegal, but step-siblings aren't blood-related. So legally, there's no issue. However, social norms and family dynamics play a big role here. The couple has been together since they were 14, which might be considered underage in some places, but they started dating when they were older. Wait, they were dating since 14, which in the US is before the age of consent in many states. That could be a problem. But the current question is about whether they're wrong now, when they're 20. The age of consent is typically 18, so maybe they're above that now. \n\nBut the main issue here is the family situation. They live with their parents, who are their girlfriend's step-parent and their mother. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister and making them feel embarrassed. The author is struggling with the pressure from the family but wants to stay with his girlfriend. \n\nEthically, the question is about whether the relationship is appropriate. Since they're not blood-related, there's no legal barrier. But the fact that they live under the same roof and their parents are married complicates things. Some might argue that the relationship could lead to social stigma or make family interactions awkward. However, the couple is in a consensual relationship, and their feelings for each other are genuine. They can't afford to move out yet, so living together isn't the same as a parent-child relationship. \n\nAnother angle is the age difference. If they started dating when they were 14, that might be a red flag, but if they were 14 and the age of consent was higher, that's a legal issue. However, the question is about the current situation when they're 20. If they were both 14 when they started dating, but now they're adults, it's more about mutual consent and their intentions. \n\nThe family's disapproval could be adding stress, but the couple is trying to ride it out until they can move out. The author's stance is that their relationship is fine, and they're not wrong for wanting to stay together despite the family's pressure. \n\nIn summary, the key points are: they are not blood-related, they are both adults now, their relationship is consensual, and they plan to move out. So, legally and ethically, they might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
