We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they've been dating their girlfriend, who's also their stepsister, since they were 14. Their parents are now married, which has caused some tension. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister and making comments. The couple wants to stay together but is dealing with the parents' disapproval.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, but there might be laws against close family relationships. Wait, stepsiblings aren't blood-related, right? So maybe it's not illegal. But I need to check that. If they're not related by blood, then maybe it's legal. But some jurisdictions might have laws about stepfamily relationships. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the user is located in a place where it's not illegal, but there's social stigma.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The couple says they're in love and have been together a long time. They're both adults now (20 years old), so they can make their own decisions. But the parents are pressuring them, which is causing stress. The parents might be acting out of concern, maybe they think it's inappropriate for their own reasons. But the couple is trying to handle it by staying together until they can move out.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. The question is whether the relationship itself is inappropriate regardless of the parents' reaction. Since they're not blood-related, maybe it's not inherently wrong. But some people might find it awkward or unethical, even if not illegal. The couple is also trying to deal with the situation by planning to move out once they can. They're not trying to push the parents' buttons; they want to stay together despite the challenges.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if the relationship could be seen as exploiting the living situation. Since they live under the same roof as their parents, there might be issues of consent or pressure. But the couple says they've been together since they were 14, so maybe it was before the parents married. The parents were okay with it when they were dating, but once they got married, the parents changed their stance. That could be a point in the author's favor because the parents are the ones complicating things now.\n\nAlso, the age when the relationship started is a factor. Starting at 14 might be considered too young in some contexts, but they were in high school and are now 20, so they've been together for years and are now adults. The key issue is whether the relationship is consensual and legal. If it's legal and both are adults, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The parents' interference is causing the problem, not the couple's relationship itself.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong if the relationship is legal and consensual. The parents' actions are the main issue here. The couple is trying to handle it by staying together until they can move out, which seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no legal aspect I'm missing. If stepsiblings are considered family in their jurisdiction, then maybe it's against the law. But if not, then it's just a social issue. Since the user didn't specify location, maybe the default assumption is that it's legal. So the answer is B.\n"
