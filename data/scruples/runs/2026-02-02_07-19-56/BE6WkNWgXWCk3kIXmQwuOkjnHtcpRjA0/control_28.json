We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They were childhood friends, became high school sweethearts, and have been dating since they were 14. Now they're 20, in college, living at home with their parents who are married. So the parents are his mom and her dad, both divorced before. The parents started being okay with their relationship when they were dating but changed after getting married. The parents now refer to them as brother and sister, which is causing tension. They can't move out yet because they can't afford it. The main issue is the family dynamics and the parents trying to break them up.\n\nThe user is asking if it's wrong for them to stay together despite this. So, the key factors here are the legality and societal norms. Legally, in most places, it's not illegal for step-siblings to date, especially if they don't share a biological parent. But the problem here is the living situation and the family pressure. \n\nThe parents are married, making them step-siblings through marriage. But if they weren't blood-related, then their relationship isn't illegal. However, there's the aspect of living under the same roof, which might complicate things. Some people might argue that it's inappropriate because of the family structure, even if it's not illegal. \n\nThe user mentions that the parents are trying to break them up, making them feel embarrassed. The couple feels they are fine and just want to wait until they can move out. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nLegally, if they're not blood-related, they're not breaking any laws. Socially, some might frown upon it, but it's a personal choice. The answer might depend on cultural norms. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but societal judgment might affect them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because it's not wrong if it's legal and they're consensual adults. However, the living situation complicates things. But the question is if the author is in the wrong, not if others are. Since the parents' actions are the problem and the couple isn't violating laws, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
