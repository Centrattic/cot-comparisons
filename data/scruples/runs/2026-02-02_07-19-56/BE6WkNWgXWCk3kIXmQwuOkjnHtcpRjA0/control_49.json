We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is that they were childhood friends, started dating when they were 14, and now live with their parents who are married. The parents are pushing them to break up, calling them brother and sister, and making it hard for them. The couple wants to stay together until they can get their own place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social norms. In many places, the age of consent is around 16-18, so since they're 20 now and were 14 when they started dating, that's probably legal. But the age difference between 14 and 16 (if they were both 14) might have been an issue, but maybe they were older. Wait, they started dating at 14, but the legal age of consent varies. Assuming they're in the US, in most states, 14 is below the age of consent, which is usually 16 or 18. Hmm, that could be a problem. Wait, but maybe they were older than that. Wait, the user says they are 20 now and have been dating since they were 14. So they started dating when they were 14? That might be illegal in some states. If that's the case, then the relationship could be considered statutory rape if one or both were under the age of consent when they started. But maybe they are now both 20, so the age isn't an issue now. But the initial relationship might have been illegal. However, the user is asking about now, not the past. So maybe the legality is a separate issue.\n\nNext, the fact that they live with their parents and the parents are against the relationship. The parents are married, so the girl is the stepdaughter of the author's father (since the mother married his father). So they are step-siblings by marriage. But in terms of family relations, the legal definitions might vary. In some places, being step-siblings and married could be legal, but here they are not married. The question is whether it's inappropriate to date a step-sibling, even if the relationship started before the parents married. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister, which complicates things.\n\nSocially, even if it's not illegal, it's considered taboo to date a step-sibling. But if they were already dating before the parents married, does that change things? The relationship isn't incestuous in terms of biology, but legally, depending on the jurisdiction, step-siblings might not be considered blood relatives, so it might not be illegal. However, socially, it's still seen as inappropriate by many because of the family dynamics and the living situation.\n\nThe living situation is a big factor here. They live in the same house as their parents, which creates a lot of tension and potential for family conflict. The parents are actively trying to drive a wedge between them, which is adding stress. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out. The author is conflicted because they want to stay together but are facing pressure from their family.\n\nThe key points are legality, social norms, and family dynamics. If the initial relationship was legal, and they are now both adults, then the legality might not be an issue. However, the social aspect is more about whether it's considered wrong regardless of legality. The fact that they are living together in the same house complicates things further, as it's a common-law situation where boundaries might be harder to maintain.\n\nIn many cultures, relationships with step-siblings are considered taboo, even if they are not blood-related. The fact that the parents are married and the girl is the stepdaughter adds to the complexity. The parents' disapproval and the living arrangement could be seen as a reason for concern. However, the couple's own feelings and the fact that they are in love and want to stay together until they can move out might be seen as their own business as long as they are not violating laws.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the relationship is legal and the cultural context. If it's legal and they are both consenting adults, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the relationship started illegally (if they were under the age of consent), that's a different matter. Since the user states they are now 20 and have been dating since 14, assuming they are in a state where the age of consent is 16 or 18, that could be a problem. But if they were 14, they might have been underage. However, the question is about now, so if they are both adults now, the legality might not be an issue anymore. \n\nSocially, though, it's still considered inappropriate by many people, which is why the parents are pushing them to break up. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong legally but is in the wrong socially. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. If the relationship is legal and they are both adults, then the answer is B (No). If the relationship was illegal initially, then A (Yes). But given the information, it's unclear if the relationship was legal from the start. The user might have to clarify that, but since the question is as presented, we have to go with the given info. The user says they are both 20 now, so the initial relationship might have been illegal. However, in some states, if they were close in age, there might be a \"close in age\" exemption. For example, if the age of consent is 16, and they were both 14, then they are two years under, which might still be illegal. But if the age of consent is lower, maybe 16, and they were 14, it's still underage. So, if the relationship started when they were under the age of consent, it's illegal, making the author in the wrong. If they were over, then not. Since the user didn't specify the state, but the scenario is in the US, we have to assume that in some states it's illegal, and in others it's not. But the user is asking if they are in the wrong, not if it's illegal. The question is about moral/ethical wrong, not legal. So even if it's legal, the social taboo might make the author in the wrong. However, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up. If the relationship is legal and both are adults, then the author isn't in the wrong. If the relationship is considered taboo but not illegal, then it's a matter of opinion. The answer depends on cultural norms. The user is asking the Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole) question, so the answer would likely be B (No) because the couple is in love and the parents are the ones causing the conflict. The parents are trying to break them up, so the author isn't the asshole for not wanting to break up.\n"
