We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 20-year-old who's in a relationship with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. They've been together since 14, live at home with their parents who are married, and the parents are trying to break them up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not wanting to break up despite the family dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, in most places, the age of consent is lower than 20, but since they're both 20 now and the relationship started when they were 14, there might be legal issues. Wait, if they started dating at 14, that's under the age of consent in many places, which could make the relationship illegal. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically, not necessarily legally. But sometimes legal and ethical lines overlap.\n\nSocially, dating a stepsibling can be controversial. Even if the relationship is consensual, some people might view it as inappropriate because of the familial connection. The fact that they live in the same house adds another layer of complexity, as cohabitation can lead to more scrutiny and potential issues. The parents' opposition is a significant factor here\u2014maybe they're concerned about legal, social, or moral reasons.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but wants to see if that's the case. The key points are the age when the relationship started, the family dynamics, and the parents' role. If they started dating when underage, that's a red flag. Also, living in the same household might complicate things, even if they plan to move out later.\n\nHowever, the author argues that they're in love and the relationship is fine, with the conflict arising from external circumstances. The parents are pushing them apart by labeling them as siblings. The author and their partner want to stay together until they can move out.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, if the relationship began when they were both underage, that's problematic. Even if they're now legal adults, starting the relationship while underage could be seen as wrong. Additionally, the fact that they live under the same roof with their parents might lead to issues of incest or boundary violations, depending on cultural norms.\n\nOn the other hand, if the legal age of consent allows for the relationship now, and both parties are fully committed and plan to move out, some might argue that their relationship is their own choice. But the initial underage aspect is a big factor here. The parents' actions in trying to break them up could also be seen as overstepping, but that's their role as parents.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, relationships between stepsiblings can be legally permissible if there's no blood relation, but if they're considered siblings due to marriage, there might be restrictions. The legality might vary, but the question is about being in the wrong. If they started underage, that's a clear issue. If they're over the age of consent now, maybe less so, but the fact that they live together complicates it further.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might be in the wrong if the relationship began when they were underage, which would make it illegal in most places. Even if it's now legal, the situation is ethically complicated due to the family dynamics and living situation. The parents' interference is problematic, but the author's decision to continue the relationship despite these challenges could be seen as wrong because of the initial age issues and the potential for inappropriate dynamics.\n"
