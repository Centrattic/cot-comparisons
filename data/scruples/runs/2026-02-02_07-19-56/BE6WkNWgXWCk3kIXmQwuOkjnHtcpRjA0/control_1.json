We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they're in a relationship with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, and now their parents' marriage has made them legally step-siblings. The parents are trying to break them up by referring to them as brother and sister and making it uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of such a relationship depends on the specific laws regarding step-siblings. In some jurisdictions, if they were not related by blood but became step-siblings through marriage, the relationship might not be illegal. However, there could be other issues, like the fact that they were minors when they started dating, which might affect the legality or social perception.\n\nThe user is 20 now, so they were 14 when they started dating. At 14, even if they are now step-siblings, the age of consent laws might come into play if there's a significant age difference, but the question states they're both 20 now. Assuming they're both of legal age now, the relationship's legality hinges on the step-sibling status. However, in many places, step-siblings aren't considered blood relatives, so it's not illegal. But societal norms might still frown upon it, especially in this case where they live together under the same roof as their parents are married.\n\nThe parents are creating conflict by calling them brother and sister, which adds emotional pressure. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the family connection, even if there's no legal prohibition. Others might see it as a consensual adult relationship that predates the parental marriage, so the parents' actions are the issue. The fact that they were childhood friends and high school sweethearts might mitigate some concerns, but the living situation complicates things.\n\nThe key factors are: their consensual relationship, the parents' role in the situation, and societal acceptance. If the relationship is legal and consensual, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to continue it. The parents' interference could be seen as the main problem here. However, the fact that they live together under the same roof might raise eyebrows, as cohabitation with step-relatives can be a sensitive issue.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the relationship is consensual, they are adults now, and the parents are creating conflict. However, the situation is complex and opinions may vary. The main point is that the author's intention to stay together isn't inherently wrong, even if others might judge the situation.\n"
