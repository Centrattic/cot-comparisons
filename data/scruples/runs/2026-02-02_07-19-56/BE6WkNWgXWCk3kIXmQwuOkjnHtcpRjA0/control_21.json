We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister due to their parents' marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. The key points here are the relationship dynamics and the living situation. The couple has been together since they were 14, which is underage in most places, but they are now 20 and presumably of legal age. However, the step-sibling relationship adds a layer of complexity.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, relationships between step-siblings may not be prohibited, especially if they were not related by blood. But the living situation where they share a home with their parents complicates things. Socially, it's considered inappropriate for a variety of reasons, including the family dynamics and potential for incest taboos, even if there's no blood relation.\n\nThe parents' marriage created the situation where the couple is now considered \"stepsiblings\" in the same household. The parents are actively trying to break them up, which adds pressure. The couple's decision to stay together might be seen as resisting external family pressure, but they are also in a situation that could be viewed as incestuous by societal standards, depending on the culture.\n\nThe main ethical question is whether the relationship is inappropriate given the family structure. Even if they were not blood-related, the fact that they live together and their parents' involvement creates a conflict of interest. There's also the issue of potential emotional manipulation and the impact on their mental health.\n\nThe user's perspective is that they don't want to break up because they love each other and have been together a long time. However, the external circumstances are affecting their relationship, and others might see it as them being in a situation that's inherently problematic.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while the couple's feelings are valid, the situation is ethically gray. Socially, it's often considered wrong due to the family dynamics, even if there's no legal prohibition. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their feelings, but the circumstances they're in could be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but I need to check if the legal and cultural aspects support that.\n"
