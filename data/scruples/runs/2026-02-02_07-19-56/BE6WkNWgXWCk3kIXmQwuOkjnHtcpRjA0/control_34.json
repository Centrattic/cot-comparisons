We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves dating a stepsister, which is a bit of a sensitive topic. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The author and his girlfriend have been together since they were 14. They are both 20 now, still living at home because their parents are married (his mom and her dad, both divorced previously). They're commuter students at the same college. Their parents, especially the mom, are trying to push them to break up by referring to the girlfriend as his sister and making derogatory comments. The couple wants to stay together until they can get their own place after graduating.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, the age of consent and the legality of the relationship are factors. Since they are both 20, they are adults, and in most places, being in a relationship with a stepsibling isn't illegal, though some places have laws against close blood relatives. However, a stepsister isn't a blood relative, so it's not illegal per se. But there's the social and family aspect to consider.\n\nSocially, there's often a stigma around stepfamily relationships, especially when there's a parent-child relationship involved. The parents' disapproval is a significant factor here. The author's parents are actively trying to break them up, which adds to the tension. The couple's desire to stay together until they can leave the household seems logical, but the situation is complicated by their living arrangements and the parents' influence.\n\nMoral and ethical considerations vary. Some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the family connection, especially given they live together and were raised in the same household. Others might see it as a normal romantic relationship between adults who are in love. The fact that they were childhood friends and long-term partners without parental approval adds another layer.\n\nThe author is struggling with societal judgment and family pressure, which is common in AITA scenarios. The key here is that both individuals are adults and capable of making their own decisions. Unless there's a legal prohibition, the decision to stay in the relationship is theirs. The parents' interference is problematic, but that doesn't necessarily mean the couple is in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the legality (not illegal), the consent of both parties, and their plans to leave the shared household, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No). The couple's situation is complex, but they are making a choice as adults, and the parents' disapproval doesn't make the relationship inherently wrong.\n"
