We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister because their parents married last year. They've been dating since they were 14 and are now 20. They live with their parents, the same home, because both parents are divorced and now married to each other. The parents initially didn't mind their relationship when they were dating, but after getting married, they started treating the couple as siblings and trying to break them up. The author and his girlfriend want to stay together until they graduate and can afford their own place. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal, but laws vary. Since the parents got married, technically they are step-siblings. However, step-sibling relationships are not considered blood relatives in most jurisdictions, so it's not illegal. But culturally, there might be stigma, which the author mentions with parents trying to act like they should be siblings.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The couple has been together for a long time, not by choice of the parents' marriage but because they were friends first. The parents only changed their stance after they got married. The parents are now using their new marriage to push the couple apart, which seems manipulative. The author feels this is an external circumstance trying to break them up. The couple is not in the wrong if they are not blood relatives and are in a consensual relationship.\n\nAlso, the parents' behavior is problematic. They are using labels like \"sister\" to create guilt or shame, which is manipulative. The author's father even makes fun of the situation, which adds to the stress. The couple is trying to handle the situation maturely by waiting until they can live independently.\n\nHowever, there might be considerations about the living situation. They live under the same roof as their parents, which could lead to conflicts or inappropriate dynamics. But the couple is working on a solution (getting their own place after graduation), so it's not like they're ignoring the issue.\n\nAnother angle: the parents' initial approval versus their current stance. If the parents were okay when the kids were dating but not married, but now that they married, they are against it, that's a change in policy. The author's parents married, which created the step-sibling status, so maybe the parents' new rules are hypocritical. The couple didn't choose the family dynamic; it's a result of their parents' decisions.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong because the relationship is consensual, not illegal in most places, and the couple is handling it responsibly. The parents are the ones creating the conflict. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
