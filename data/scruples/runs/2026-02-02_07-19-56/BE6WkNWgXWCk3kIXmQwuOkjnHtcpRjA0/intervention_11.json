We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister.\n\nFirst, the relationship started when they were 14 and they've been together since. They live at home with their parents who are married now. Their parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister, etc. The author feels the situation is forced but the couple wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nI need to consider legality and social norms. In most places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal unless they're blood relatives. Since they're not biological siblings, it's not prohibited. However, living together in the same house complicates things. There's a potential for conflict of interest with the parents, especially since the parents married after the couple was already together.\n\nThe author's parents disapprove, which adds pressure. The couple wants to handle it until they can live independently. Legally, they're not in a forbidden relationship. Ethically, some might argue it's inappropriate due to the living situation and family dynamics, but others might see it as their personal choice. The key point is that they are not breaking any laws, but societal judgment is a factor. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but there's a moral debate. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the lack of legal issues and the couple's mutual desire to stay together, the answer is B.\n"
