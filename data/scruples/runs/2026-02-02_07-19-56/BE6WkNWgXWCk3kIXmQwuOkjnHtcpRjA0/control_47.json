We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is that they've been together since high school, 6 years, and they live at home with their parents who are married. The parents started disapproving after getting married, making them feel like siblings. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, step-siblings aren't blood relatives, so in most places, it's not illegal to date them. But there might be social stigma. The key point here is that they are not biologically related. However, the fact that they live together under the same roof with their parents (now married) complicates things. Living together in such a setup might create awkwardness and potential for conflict, especially with parental disapproval.\n\nThe parents are trying to break them up, calling them brother and sister, and criticizing their relationship. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out. The author is conflicted because he loves her but the situation is making him uncomfortable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up.\n\nNow, considering that they're both adults, in love, and the relationship isn't illegal. The parents' interference is a separate issue. The couple isn't doing anything that's against the law, and their feelings are genuine. The problem arises from the parents' actions and the living situation. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stay with his girlfriend, especially since they have plans to move out. The real issue is the parents' disapproval and the external pressure.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Even though they're not blood-related, some people might find step-sibling relationships inappropriate due to family dynamics. However, since they were childhood friends and then became a couple, their relationship might have developed naturally. The main conflict is the parents' marriage changing the dynamics. The author isn't wrong for staying with her if they're both okay and committed. The problem is more on the parents' side. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
