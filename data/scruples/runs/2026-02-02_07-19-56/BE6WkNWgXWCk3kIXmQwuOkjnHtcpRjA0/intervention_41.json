We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a guy and his girlfriend who's also his stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, which is pretty young. Now they're 20 and still in high school/college. Their parents got married, making them live under the same roof. The parents are against the relationship now, calling them brother and sister, and trying to break them up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legality of such a relationship can vary. Since they're minors (they were 14 when they started dating), there might be issues with underage relationships. Even if they're now 20, depending on the jurisdiction, relationships between step-siblings might be legally permissible or not. But the user didn't mention the location, so that's a bit tricky. However, socially, there are often taboos around step-siblings dating, especially if they grew up together and live in the same household. It can blur boundaries and lead to conflicts, as seen here with the parents pushing against the relationship.\n\nThe author mentions that the parents were okay with it when they were just dating but changed their stance when they married. The parents are now making their lives difficult by forcing the step-sibling dynamic. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out. The author loves the girl and doesn't want to break up because of external circumstances.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the family connection and living situation, even if there's no legal prohibition. Others might say that if the couple is consensual, in love, and planning to leave the situation soon, it's their choice. However, the fact that they started dating at 14 (which is underage in many places) and were in a relationship during their formative years could complicate things. There's also the potential for power dynamics or manipulation, especially if one is older or in a position of influence.\n\nThe parents' role is also a factor. They got married, creating the step-sibling relationship, but then opposed the existing relationship. The author's real dad's dismissive attitude adds to the family tension. The couple's desire to stay together until they can move out might be understandable, but the living situation could create ongoing stress and scrutiny.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community often looks at whether someone is violating social norms or causing harm. The author isn't necessarily causing direct harm to others (unless the parents are being hurt by their actions, but the parents are the ones opposing them). However, the situation is complicated by family dynamics and the potential for future complications, such as legal issues if they continue once they move out.\n\nI think the key points are the legality (if applicable), the age at which the relationship started, and the living situation. Even if the author isn't breaking the law, the social stigma and the parents' interference might make him the asshole in the eyes of the AITA community. However, if the relationship is legal and the couple is planning to leave the situation, some might argue they're not in the wrong. But given the young age when they started and the family context, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the social and ethical implications, even if there's no legal issue.\n"
