We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend who's also his stepsister. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships here. The author and his girlfriend have been dating since they were 14, which is when they were 14, and they're now 20. So their relationship started in their early teens. They're both commuters at the same college and still live at home with their respective parents who are now married. The parents got married last year, and the parents' relationship is causing issues by trying to break up the couple. The author feels pressured by his mom to call his girlfriend \"sister\" and faces judgment from his parents. They want to stay together until they can move out after graduation.\n\nNow, the key points here. The main issue is whether dating a stepsibling is inappropriate. Legally, in most places, it's not illegal unless there's a close blood relation. But socially, it's often frowned upon. The couple started dating as teenagers, which might also be a factor. Depending on the age when they started dating, it could have been illegal if they were below the age of consent. But since they were 14 and started dating, if the age of consent in their state is lower, that might not be an issue, but if it's higher, that could complicate things.\n\nThe parents are now married, which changes the familial designation. Before the parents married, they were just step-siblings, but now they're technically \"siblings\" due to the marriage. However, biologically, they're not related. The parents are actively trying to break them up, which adds to the conflict.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong if the relationship isn't violating any laws. However, the fact that they're living under the same roof, still teenagers when they started dating, and the social stigma might lead people to think they're in the wrong. The question is whether they're doing something inherently wrong, regardless of the parents' actions.\n\nBut since the parents are the ones causing the conflict, and the couple is considering staying together despite the external pressures, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. People might criticize the relationship for being inappropriate or for the parents' sake, but if there's no legal or direct familial blood relation, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to stay with his partner. The answer would likely be B (No), but need to check for any overlooked legal or ethical aspects.\n"
