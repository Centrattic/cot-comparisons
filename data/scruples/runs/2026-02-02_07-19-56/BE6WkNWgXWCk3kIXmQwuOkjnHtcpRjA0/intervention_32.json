We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who's also his stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, and now their parents are married, causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, the legal age for marriage is higher than 20, but they're already in a relationship. However, the key issue here is the family dynamics. They live with their parents and are considered siblings in a stepfamily context. \n\nThe parents are trying to break them up, using the fact that they're now \"brother and sister\" by marriage. The author feels the situation is being forced upon them. Legally, as long as they're not blood-related, the relationship might be acceptable. But socially, it's complicated because of the family structure.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if there's no legal prohibition, the main concern is the pressure from the parents and the living situation. The couple wants to stay together despite family interference. The question is whether being in a relationship with a stepsibling is inherently wrong, regardless of their feelings.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but maybe others see it differently. The answer hinges on cultural norms and family dynamics. If the relationship is consensual and there's no legal barrier, some might say they're not at fault. However, the age and the fact that they started dating young could be a point of concern. But since they're now adults, that might be less of an issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the relationship isn't illegal, and their decision to stay together despite family pressure is a personal choice.\n"
