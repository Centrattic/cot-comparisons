We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because they grew up together, have been dating since they were teenagers, and now their parents are married, making them live under the same roof. The parents are trying to break them up by treating them as siblings and making comments that cause tension. The question is whether their relationship is inappropriate and if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and societal aspects. In many places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal. However, the term \"stepsister\" here is due to their parents' remarriage, so they aren't biologically related. But there's a social stigma because their families are now married, and they live together. The parents' actions are complicating the situation by enforcing a step-sibling relationship.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, the couple is in a consensual, committed relationship. They love each other and don't want to break up. The problem arises from the external circumstances\u2014living with their parents, the parents' disapproval, and the social dynamics. The author isn't doing anything unethical in terms of relationship boundaries; the conflict is external. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the situation is problematic because of the family structure. For example, living with their parents and the potential for conflicts of interest. But the couple is trying to maintain their relationship despite the external pressures, not forcing the situation. They are planning to move out after graduation, which shows they have a plan to resolve the living situation. \n\nThe key points here are consent, legality, and the couple's feelings versus the family's disapproval. Since both are adults, their relationship isn't inherently wrong. The parents' interference is the main issue here. The stepsibling dynamic is a social construct in this case, not a blood relation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stay with his girlfriend despite the family's objections. The answer should be B, No.\n"
