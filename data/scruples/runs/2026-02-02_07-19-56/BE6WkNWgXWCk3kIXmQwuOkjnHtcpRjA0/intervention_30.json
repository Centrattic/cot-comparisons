We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who's also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because they grew up together, started dating young, and now their parents are married, making them technically stepsiblings. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and societal norms. In many places, the legality of a relationship between stepsiblings depends on the state or country. For example, in some U.S. states, it's legal as long as they're not blood-related, which they aren't here. So legally, they might not be doing anything wrong.\n\nNext, the ethical or moral aspect. The key points here are their age when the relationship started and how long they've been together. They were 14 when they started dating, which is under the age of consent in many jurisdictions. That's a red flag. However, the user mentions they're now 20 and have been dating for six years. The initial relationship might have been inappropriate due to their young age and possibly close family environment, but they've since matured.\n\nAnother factor is the living situation. They're still living at home with their parents, which can create tension and potential conflicts of interest. The parents' behavior\u2014trying to break them up\u2014could be seen as manipulative or overstepping, which is complicating their relationship.\n\nThe question is whether they should be together given their current legal status as stepsiblings. Since they are not blood-related, many people might argue that it's their personal choice as long as both are consenting adults. However, societal stigma and the parents' interference add layers of complexity.\n\nThe user's real question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial start of the relationship might be questionable, but if they've both consented and are now adults, the decision to stay together could be seen as their right. However, the fact that their parents are married and the living situation makes it a sensitive and possibly taboo scenario. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, even if it's legal, some people might still view it as inappropriate due to the family dynamic. But others might prioritize the individuals' happiness and autonomy. The answer likely hinges on whether the relationship is consensual, legal, and if both parties are comfortable with the situation despite external pressures.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might not be straightforward. However, if the relationship started when they were underage, that's a clear issue. But since they're now adults and the legality varies, the main issue is societal acceptance and personal choice. The author's stance is to stay together despite the family's disapproval, which could be seen as standing up for their relationship, but the initial start might still be a point against them. \n\nI think the key here is whether the relationship's legality and consent are in order. If they're both adults and it's legal, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the relationship began when they were underage, that's a separate issue. The original post doesn't mention any specific illegal activity, so focusing on current circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if the relationship is legal now. But if the initial start was underage, that's a point where they were wrong. However, the question is about the current decision not to break up. So perhaps the answer is B, as the focus is on their current choice, not the past.\n"
