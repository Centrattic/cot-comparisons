We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. They provided a detailed Reddit-style post where the person is in a relationship with their stepsister, which their parents are against after they got married. The author is conflicted because they love each other but are facing pressure from their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. In many places, dating a stepsibling isn't illegal unless they're blood relatives. Since they're step-siblings, there's no legal barrier. Legally, they're not related by blood, so the relationship isn't prohibited. But there are social and familial implications.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that they live at the same home, which is a common setting for a de facto relationship. However, the parents disapprove and are trying to break them up. The author is choosing to stay with their girlfriend despite the pressure. They plan to stay together until they can get their own place.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's a gray area. Some people might argue that the relationship is inappropriate because of the family connection, especially since they live together and the parents are involved. Others might say that if they're both adults, in love, and not harming anyone else, it's their right to be together. The key factors here are consent, maturity, and the impact on their family dynamics.\n\nThe author mentions that their parents are trying to push them apart, which could create tension and stress in the household. However, the couple's decision to stay together isn't inherently wrong unless it's causing direct harm to others. Since they plan to leave the shared home eventually, maybe the situation is temporary.\n\nI should also consider if there's any exploitation or coercion involved. The post doesn't suggest that. Both partners are in agreement and have been together since high school. The parents' disapproval isn't a reason for the author to break up unless there's a legal or serious ethical issue.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the answer might hinge on whether societal norms or personal autonomy take precedence. If the relationship is consensual and not causing direct harm, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the potential for family conflict and living under the same roof with parents who oppose it complicates things. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the relationship is consensual and they're planning to resolve the living situation in the future.\n"
