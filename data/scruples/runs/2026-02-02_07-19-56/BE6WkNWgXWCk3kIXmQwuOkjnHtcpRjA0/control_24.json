We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's dating his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister because his mom married her dad. They've been together since they were 14, now 20, and they live at home with both their parents. The parents started being against their relationship after getting married, leading to tension. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In the US, the legality of such a relationship depends on the state. Some states have laws against marriage between step-siblings, but since they're not blood-related, it might be legal in some places. However, even if it's legal, social norms might consider it taboo. But the key here is their age and how long they've been together. They started dating at 14, which is below the age of consent in most states, so that's a red flag. Wait, if they started dating when they were 14, but the age of consent varies by state. Let me check: Generally, the age of consent in the US is 16 or 18. If they started dating at 14, in most states that would be illegal, so that's a problem. However, if they are now 20, maybe that part is in the past. The question is about their current relationship, but the fact that they started when they were underage could be a legal issue.\n\nAlso, the fact that they live with their parents, and the parents are trying to break them up adds to the complexity. The parents' marriage is affecting the kids' relationship. The main issues here are legality, age of consent, social stigma, and the parents' interference. \n\nThe author argues that their relationship is fine and the problem comes from the parents. But regardless of that, if the relationship started when they were underage, that's a problem. Even if they are now of age, the initial part could be illegal. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they started a relationship when underage. \n\nBut maybe the user is from a state where the age of consent is lower? Let's say in some states the age is 16, and they were 14 when they started dating, so they were two years underage. That's a legal violation. So regardless of their current feelings, the fact that they started the relationship when they were underage is a legal issue. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because of that. \n\nAdditionally, even if the age is not an issue, the social aspect is complicated. Dating a stepsibling can be legally allowed but socially frowned upon. The parents' disapproval is part of the situation, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship was started legally and ethically, then maybe not. However, starting at 14 in most places is problematic. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the initial relationship was illegal. If yes, then the author is in the wrong. If not, maybe not. But given that the user is asking for a general answer without knowing the state, the safest assumption is that starting at 14 is under the age of consent in most places, making the author at fault. Therefore, answer A.\n"
