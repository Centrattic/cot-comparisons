We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 20-year-old couple who have been dating since they were 14. They're also step-siblings because their parents married last year, making them live under the same roof as a stepfamily. The main issue is whether their relationship is inappropriate given their current living situation and the family dynamics.\n\nFirst, legal aspects: In many places, the legal age of consent is 16 or 18, so being 20, they're past that. However, some jurisdictions have laws against relationships between step-siblings, especially if they're living together. But I'm not sure about the specifics in their state. Need to check that, but since the user is asking for an ethical/moral judgment, maybe legal isn't the main point here.\n\nMoral/ethical considerations: They were childhood friends turned high school sweethearts. The parents initially approved until they got married. Now the parents are trying to break them up. The couple wants to stay together but can't move out yet due to financial constraints. The question is whether the relationship is inappropriate regardless of their feelings.\n\nSocial norms: Society often frowns upon relationships that could be perceived as incestuous, even if they're step-relations. The fact that they live together might exacerbate this, as cohabitation can be seen as more serious. However, the couple isn't biologically related, which some might argue makes it less problematic than actual siblings. But the term \"stepsister\" is still used, which can create social stigma.\n\nPsychological impact: The couple is stressed because of their parents' interference, which is causing tension. They feel the situation is being forced upon them by external factors, not their own choice. They're committed to each other and plan to stay together until they can move out. But is their long-term commitment enough to justify continuing the relationship?\n\nEthical dilemma: The key here is whether the relationship is inherently wrong because of their family ties and living arrangement, regardless of their feelings. Some might argue that the relationship is inappropriate due to the family connection and the potential for power imbalances or social judgment. Others might believe that if both parties are adults, in love, and capable of making their own decisions, the relationship is acceptable.\n\nAlso, the parents' behavior is a factor. They seem to be pressuring the couple to break up, which adds another layer of conflict. However, the question is about the couple's actions, not the parents'.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on one's perspective. If we consider that they are not biologically related and are adults making a mutual choice, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the social stigma and potential legal issues (depending on location) might lead some to side against them. Since the user wants a binary answer (A or B), I need to decide based on the information given. The couple is in a complex situation, but if they're both adults and the relationship is consensual, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, if societal norms and potential legal issues are considered, maybe A. But without specific legal context, and given that they're planning to move out, the ethical stance could be that they're not in the wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
