We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 20-year-old who's been dating their girlfriend since 14, and now she's their stepsister because their parents married. They live at home together since they're commuting to college. The author is upset because their mom keeps referring to the girlfriend as a sister and other parents are trying to break them up. They want to stay together until they can move out after graduation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, the age of consent and the fact they're both adults might be relevant. In many places, as long as both parties are adults and not blood-related, it's legal. But since they became stepsiblings due to their parents' marriage, does that change anything? Some places have laws against relationships that become step-siblings after marriage, which could complicate things. That's a legal area that varies by jurisdiction.\n\nEthically, there's the question of how the relationship started. They were friends and started dating before the parents married. The parents initially agreed to their relationship but changed their stance once they got married. The author and his girlfriend are now stuck in a living situation that's causing tension. They want to stay together but are under pressure from their parents. The author is conflicted but wants to continue the relationship because they love each other.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. Since they live under the same roof as their parents, there's a potential for coercion or pressure from the parents. The parents might be using their authority to influence the relationship, especially with the mom making comments and other parents being involved. The couple's autonomy is being challenged here.\n\nSocially, dating a stepsibling can be taboo, even if they weren't related by blood initially. People might judge them for continuing the relationship after becoming stepsiblings. The author mentions that friends are aware, which adds to the social pressure. However, the couple seems to genuinely care about each other and their relationship isn't their fault in terms of the circumstances leading to it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're both adults and the relationship is consensual, then legally they might not be at fault. However, the fact that their parents' marriage created this step-sibling relation could complicate things. If their jurisdiction has laws against such relationships, they might be in a legally problematic situation. Ethically, some might argue that continuing the relationship despite the parents' disapproval and the living situation is inappropriate, while others might see it as a matter of their right to love whom they choose once they're adults.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The key factors are legality, autonomy, coercion, and societal norms. If they're not breaking any laws and the relationship is consensual, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if there's an element of coercion from the parents or if their living situation is causing harm, that could tip the balance. However, the couple is trying to handle it responsibly by planning to move out when possible.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the legal status. If it's legal where they are, then no, they're not in the wrong. If not, then yes. But since the user didn't specify the legal context, I have to assume it's a jurisdiction where it's allowed. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
