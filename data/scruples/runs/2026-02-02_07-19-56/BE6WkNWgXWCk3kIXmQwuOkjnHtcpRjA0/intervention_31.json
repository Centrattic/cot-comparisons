We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The person is in a relationship with their girlfriend, who is also their step-sister because their parents got married. They've been together since they were 14 and are now 20. They live at home with both parents, which complicates the situation. The parents started opposing the relationship after getting married, even though they were okay with it when they were just dating. The couple wants to stay together but are stuck in this awkward living situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the legal age for marriage is 18, and since they're both 20 now, they're adults. However, some places have laws about incest or relationships between step-siblings. Let me check that. In the US, for example, laws vary by state. Some states consider step-siblings as non-blood relatives, so it might not be illegal. Others might have specific prohibitions. If they're in a state where it's legal, then maybe there's no legal issue. But even if it's legal, there's the social and family aspect.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The parents are creating tension by referring to them as brother and sister, which is causing stress. The couple is dealing with this pressure but still wants to stay together. The question is whether the relationship is inappropriate regardless of the circumstances.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the relationship is problematic because of the family connection through marriage, even if they weren't related by blood. Others might say that if both are adults and consent, it's their choice. However, the fact that they grew up together could be a red flag, as relationships formed in childhood can have complexities. Also, living under the same roof might complicate the relationship further, as boundaries are harder to maintain.\n\nThe couple's parents getting involved and trying to break them up adds another layer. The parents were okay with the relationship when they were dating but changed their stance after marriage. That seems hypocritical, especially if the marriage was the reason the step-sibling situation arose.\n\nThe user's main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up. The author feels the situation is not their fault but is struggling with family pressure. They want to stay together because they love each other and don't see it as wrong. The answer depends on whether the relationship is considered inappropriate by societal or familial standards, even if legally permissible.\n\nIn summary, if the relationship is legal and both parties are consenting adults, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the social stigma and family issues could make it a difficult situation. The key points are legality, consent, and whether the relationship is considered incestuous by societal standards. If the laws in their area don't prohibit it, then it's their choice. But if they're facing social backlash, it's more about personal and family ethics rather than legal wrongs.\n"
