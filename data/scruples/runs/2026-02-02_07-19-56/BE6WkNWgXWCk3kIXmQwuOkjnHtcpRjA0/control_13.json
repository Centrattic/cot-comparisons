We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're dating their girlfriend, who's also their stepsister. They've been together since they were 14, and now they're 20. Their parents got married last year, which changed things. The parents are now making it hard by referring to them as brother and sister, and trying to break them up. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the laws and social norms around dating or marrying relatives. In many places, it's illegal to marry close blood relatives, but step-siblings aren't blood-related. However, there might be laws against marrying step-relations in some states, depending on jurisdiction. The user mentioned they're in the U.S., so it depends on the state laws. For example, in some states, it's illegal to marry your step-sibling, but others might allow it. But since they're not married yet, maybe that's not the immediate issue. However, the fact that they live together and are romantically involved could be a legal gray area in some places.\n\nSocially, even if it's not illegal, there might be stigma. The parents are using social pressure against them, which is a problem. The couple feels they're being targeted unfairly because their parents got married, leading to them being called siblings. The user is conflicted because they love each other and don't see anything wrong, but the external pressure is making them question themselves.\n\nThe key points here are whether the relationship is legal, the age of consent (they were 14 when they started dating, which is underage in most places, so that's a problem), and the fact that they live under the same roof with their parents. The parents might be right in being concerned about their underage relationship, but since they were 14 when it started, that's a past issue. Now they're adults, but still in the same house, which could be a legal issue depending on where they live. If the relationship is illegal in their state, then the author might be in the wrong. If not, then it's more about social and familial pressure.\n\nBut the user is asking if they're in the wrong because they don't want to break up. The parents are making their lives difficult, but the couple is fine. The question is about whether the relationship is inappropriate regardless of external factors. If the relationship is legal and the couple is in a consensual relationship, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the relationship is illegal, then they are in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were in a relationship when they were underage (14) could be a point against them. In many places, 14 is below the age of consent, so even if they're now adults, the fact that the relationship started when they were minors could be problematic legally or ethically.\n\nSo putting it all together: if their relationship is illegal in their state, then the author is in the wrong. If it's legal, then maybe not. But there's also the underage aspect. However, since they were underage at the start of the relationship, that's a past issue. But if they are still together and in a legal relationship, then maybe not. The answer depends on legal specifics, but since we don't know the state, it's hard. But generally, in many U.S. states, it's illegal to marry a step-sibling, but not all. So the answer might be that they are in the wrong because the relationship is considered inappropriate and illegal, but if it's legal, then not. However, the initial underage dating is problematic.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not breaking up. The AITA question is about social morality, not just legality. Even if it's legal, people might still think they're in the wrong because of the step-sibling relation. But the couple doesn't see the issue, only the external pressure. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the relationship is consensual and the issue is the parents' interference. But if the relationship is considered incestuous (even if not blood-related), then maybe A. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since the user is asking for an answer, considering that step-siblings are not blood relatives in many cases, and unless it's illegal in their state, they might not be wrong. So answer B.\n"
