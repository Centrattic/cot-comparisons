We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because they've been together since they were 14, both 20 now, and their parents got married last year, making them live in the same house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The age of consent where they are is probably 16 or lower, since they were 14 when they started dating. But wait, being stepsiblings\u2014some places have laws against incest, but it depends on the state. However, if they're not blood-related, maybe it's allowed. The user mentions that their parents are married, so the step-sibling relationship is formed through marriage. If there's no blood relation, then it's not illegal.\n\nNext, social and familial issues. The parents are trying to break them up, which is causing stress. The parents' behavior might be the main problem here. The couple is in love and wants to stay together until they can move out. They're both adults, and their relationship is consensual. The parents are using labels like \"brother and sister\" to shame them, which is emotional manipulation. The couple's living situation is a factor, but they can't move out yet due to financial constraints.\n\nMoral and ethical perspectives vary. Some might say that the relationship is inappropriate because of the family connection, even if not illegal. Others might argue that their long-term relationship and mutual feelings make it valid. The key points are consent, legality, and the impact of external pressures.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the relationship is legal if they're not blood-related, they're consensual adults, and the pressure comes from the parents. The answer should be B.\n"
