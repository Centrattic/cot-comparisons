We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. The situation is complicated because they're both in college, living at home with their parents who are married. The parents started disapproving after getting married, even though they were okay with the relationship before. The couple wants to stay together until they can get their own place after graduating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. The question is about whether the relationship is inappropriate. In many places, being step-siblings doesn't make a relationship illegal unless there's a biological relation. However, some states have laws against marriage between step-siblings, but if they're not married yet, maybe it's okay. But the main issue here is the living situation and the pressure from the parents.\n\nThe key points are that they were childhood friends, started dating at 14 (which might be under the age of consent, but they're now 20), and their parents have changed their stance after getting married. The parents are trying to separate them by calling them brother and sister and making them uncomfortable. The couple is fine with each other but the external pressure is causing stress.\n\nEthically, people might argue that it's a close relationship and living under the same roof complicates things. But if they genuinely love each other and plan to leave the situation after college, is that their fault? They're not causing the problem; the parents' actions are. The author isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to stay with someone he loves. The main issue is the parents' disapproval and the living situation, which isn't the couple's fault. So the author isn't in the wrong; the parents are creating the conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
