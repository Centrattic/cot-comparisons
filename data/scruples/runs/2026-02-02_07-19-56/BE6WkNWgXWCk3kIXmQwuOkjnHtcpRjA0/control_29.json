We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is in a relationship with their stepsister, who is also their girlfriend and effectively their sister because their parents married. They've been together since they were 14, which is a long time. Now, they live at home with their parents because they're commuter students. The parents, especially the mom, are trying to break them up by calling the girlfriend \"sister\" and making it awkward. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to break up despite this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and cultural aspects. In many places, the legality of marriage between step-siblings depends on how they're related. If they're not blood-related, it might be legal, but social norms might still frown upon it. However, in some jurisdictions, even if they're not blood-related, there might be laws against marriage if they're considered \"siblings by marriage.\" But since they're not blood-related, maybe it's not illegal. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not necessarily legally.\n\nThe age is a factor. They started dating at 14, which might have been legally okay if the age of consent in their state is lower, but 14 seems very young in many places. The fact that they've been together for six years and are now 20 might mean that the relationship was started when they were minors, which could have legal implications. However, the story doesn't specify the legal age of consent in their location, so I can't be sure. But even if it's legal, the social stigma is there. The parents are trying to break them up, which adds to the tension.\n\nLiving under the same roof with parents complicates things. It's a situation where the parents are trying to make the relationship uncomfortable. The author mentions that their parents are married, which created this situation despite the couple's initial objections. The parents' behavior is manipulative, and the author feels that the relationship is being targeted. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nThe author's stance is that they're in love and the relationship is fine, and the external factors (parents, societal expectations) are trying to break them up. They don't want to break up because they love each other and have been together for so long. The question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the relationship is consensual and legal, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the relationship was started when they were minors (14), depending on the laws, that could be problematic. But since they are now 20, if the relationship was started underage, that could be a point against them. However, the story doesn't clarify if that was legal. If it's legal now, then maybe they're okay.\n\nThe main issue here is the parents' interference and the social stigma. The author is not doing anything against their will; the girlfriend is also in the relationship. The problem is the parents' pressure. So, the author isn't in the wrong if the relationship is consensual and legal. However, the initial starting of the relationship at 14 might be a red flag if it's underage, but that's not specified here. Since the question is about the current situation (not wanting to break up despite the parents' pressure), and if the relationship is otherwise healthy, the answer would lean towards \"not in the wrong.\" \n\nSo, the answer is B (No).\n"
