We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they've been dating their stepsister since they were 14, now 20, and they're living at home with their parents who got married. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister and making comments. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and consent aspect. They started dating at 14, which is underage in most places. Even now, being 20, if they're in a state where the age of consent is higher than 18, there might have been issues. But the main question is about being in the wrong now that they're both adults. However, if they were underage when the relationship started, that's a legal concern.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. They are stepsiblings due to their parents' marriage. The parents are creating tension by referring to them as siblings. The couple is trying to maintain their relationship despite the parents' interference. The user is asking if it's wrong for them to not break up.\n\nAnother angle is societal norms and family relationships. Dating a stepsibling can be complicated, especially when living under the same roof. The parents' push to break them up adds pressure. But the couple claims the relationship is healthy and they want to stay together.\n\nI should check if there's any incest laws involved. In many places, while first cousins can marry, stepsiblings are not related by blood, so it's legal. However, if there's a legal or cultural taboo, that might affect the perception. But legally, in most jurisdictions, it's not illegal for stepsiblings to date, even if they live together.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the situation is inappropriate because of the family role they play in each other's lives. The fact that they live together might complicate the relationship, making it harder to separate personal and family boundaries.\n\nBut the couple is in their final years of education and planning to move out. They don't see any immediate problems in their relationship. The parents are the ones causing conflict, so the couple's stance is to endure until they can leave.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: legality (if they're now both adults and it's legal), autonomy in their relationship, parents' interference, and societal views. The answer might depend on whether the relationship is consensual and legal now. If they started underage, that's a problem. If they're now both adults in a legal relationship, some might say they're not in the wrong. However, the stepsibling dynamic could still be seen as inappropriate by some. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up. Since the author argues the relationship is healthy and the issue is the parents' interference, perhaps the answer is B (No). But if the relationship started underage, then maybe A (Yes). The post says they were 14 when they started dating, which in many places is below the age of consent, making the relationship illegal. That would mean the author is in the wrong because it's unlawful. However, if they are now both adults and the relationship is legal in their jurisdiction, then it's more about personal choice. But the initial underage aspect might make the author in the wrong. Need to consider both legal and ethical aspects.\n"
