We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his stepsister. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together since 14, now they're 20, and they live at home with their parents who are married. So he's his girlfriend's stepfather's ex-wife's new husband's son or something like that. Wait, no, his mom and her dad are married. So his mom is his girlfriend's stepmom, right? Because the girl's dad is his mom's new husband. So they're step-siblings through their parents' marriage.\n\nThe main question is whether it's inappropriate for them to date. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not breaking up.\n\nLegally, if they're not blood-related, there's no law against it. But socially, step-siblings are considered family in many cultures, so dating them might be seen as taboo. However, if their parents are married but the author and his girlfriend were not raised together as siblings, maybe it's different. But in this case, they were childhood friends turned sweethearts, so they might have a long relationship before the step-sibling status came into play.\n\nThe problem arises when their parents started pushing them apart after getting married. The key issue here is whether the relationship is considered inappropriate given their living situation and the family dynamics. They can't move out yet, so they're stuck living under the same roof as their parents who are encouraging the breakup.\n\nThe author is saying they're both fine, but the external pressure is causing stress. The question is if the relationship itself is wrong regardless of their feelings. Some might argue that step-siblings, even if not blood-related, are considered family, so dating them is taboo. Others might say if they were childhood friends first and became a couple after the parents married, it's a matter of personal choice and not inherently wrong, but the living situation complicates things.\n\nAlso, the parents are using labels like \"sister\" to make it uncomfortable. The author is resisting breaking up because he loves her and they want to stay together until they can move out.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's a gray area. Legally, if they're not closely related, it's okay. But culturally, step-siblings dating can be controversial. So the answer might depend on the perspective. The AITA community often looks at intent and harm. Since the couple is fine and the conflict is from the parents, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might say the situation is inherently problematic.\n\nI think the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the relationship is consensual and they're both adults. The parents' disapproval doesn't make the relationship wrong, especially if they're not blood-related. The main issue is the external pressure and living situation, not the relationship itself.\n"
