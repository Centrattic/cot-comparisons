We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who's also his stepsister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been together since they were 14, so that's six years. They're both 20 and in college, still living at home because their parents are married. The parents were okay with their relationship when they were dating, but once they got married, things changed. The parents started calling them brother and sister, trying to make them feel embarrassed. The author's mom even does stuff like telling him to tell his \"sister\" something. His dad is dismissive and makes jokes about it. They can't move in with his real dad because of drug issues, and the girlfriend's mom isn't part of her life. They can't afford their own place until after college.\n\nSo the author is asking if it's wrong that they want to stay together despite the parents' disapproval. The main ethical question here is whether the relationship is inappropriate by societal standards or legal. In many places, step-siblings aren't blood-related, so the relationship isn't illegal. Legally, as long as they aren't blood relatives, it's allowed. But socially, there might be stigma because of the family connection. However, since they were friends first and have been together for so long, it's more of a long-term relationship that started before the parental marriage. The parents' push to break them up might be more about their own discomfort than the kids' well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the living situation. They are living under the same roof as their parents, which could create tension. But the couple isn't causing the marriage; the marriage happened after their relationship was already established. The author feels that their parents are trying to drive a wedge between them, which is adding stress. The key points are their age, consent, the legality, and whether the parents' actions are justified. Since the couple is in a consensual relationship, and the parents' marriage is the complicating factor, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
