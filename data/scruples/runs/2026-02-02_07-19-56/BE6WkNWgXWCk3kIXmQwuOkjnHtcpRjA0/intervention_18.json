We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with his girlfriend, who is also his step-sister. Their parents are married, which complicates things. They started dating when they were 14, which is pretty young, and they're still in their early 20s now. The main issue seems to be the living situation and the parents' disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the legal age for marriage is 18, so if they started dating at 14, depending on the jurisdiction, there might have been legal issues. However, the user is from the US, and the specifics can vary by state. But since they're now 20 and planning to graduate and get jobs, maybe the legal age isn't the problem anymore.\n\nNext, the relationship itself. They were childhood friends and became high school sweethearts. The parents initially accepted their relationship when they were dating but after marriage, disapproved. The parents are trying to break them up by labeling them as sister and brother, which is a common strategy to create discomfort. The author feels conflicted but doesn't want to break up because they love each other and want to get through college together.\n\nIs it inappropriate to date a step-sister? Legally, it's not illegal in many places, but socially, it can be frowned upon, especially when there's a parental marriage involved. The key here is whether the relationship is consensual and both parties are of legal age. Since they're both adults now, and assuming they're both consenting adults, the ethical issue might be more about societal norms than any legal wrongdoing.\n\nThe parents' disapproval and the living situation are significant stressors. The couple wants to stay together until they can move out. The author's reasoning is that they're happy and want to overcome the external pressures. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining the relationship despite the family opposition.\n\nIn many cultures, relationships between step-siblings are not legally or ethically prohibited, as they are not blood-related. However, the social stigma and family dynamics can make it challenging. The author's stance is that the relationship is fine and the family's interference is the problem. Others might argue that the step-sibling relationship and cohabitation with the parents adds a layer of complexity that could be problematic, even if the relationship itself is consensual.\n\nSo, considering all factors: legal age, consent, social norms, and the parents' role. The author is not in the wrong if the relationship is consensual and legal. The parents' actions are creating conflict, but the couple's choice to stay together is their right. Therefore, the answer would likely be B for No.\n"
