We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with his stepsister, whom he has known since childhood. They've been dating since they were 14 and are both 20 now. Their parents got married, which complicated their living situation. They're still living at home, which is causing tension because their parents want to break them up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In many places, the legal age for marriage is 18, and relationships between step-siblings might not be legally recognized or allowed. However, the scenario here is a romantic relationship, not marriage. But legally, depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws about incest or relationships between step-relations. I should check if there are any legal implications here.\n\nNext, social and familial aspects. Step-siblings aren't blood-related, but they share a household. The parents' marriage created this situation. The user's parents were initially okay with their relationship when they were just dating but changed their stance after marriage. This could create a conflict of interest, as the parents might feel protective or have other concerns. The user feels that the parents are trying to drive a wedge between them, which adds to the tension.\n\nEmotionally, the couple has been together for a long time and plans to stay together until they can move out. They claim the relationship is healthy. The parents are using terms like \"brother and sister\" to undermine their relationship, which could be a form of emotional manipulation. The user is frustrated by this interference.\n\nEthically, there's a debate. While there's no blood relation, the social stigma and potential for conflict within the family are significant. The couple living together under the same roof as their parents complicates things further. Even if they are in love, the external pressures from family and societal norms might make it challenging.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are legality, ethical considerations, and the impact on family dynamics. If there's no legal prohibition, then the ethical aspect becomes more about personal and societal values. However, some argue that relationships with step-siblings are problematic due to the close family environment and potential for coercion or conflict of interest, especially when the parents' marriage created the situation.\n\nThe user mentions that they are not breaking up because they are in love and the relationship is fine. The main issue is the parents' interference and the living situation. The AITA aspect is whether the author is at fault for maintaining the relationship despite the family tensions.\n\nIn many cultures, step-sibling relationships are not legally prohibited, but they can be socially frowned upon. The author isn't in a blood relation, but the social context is complex. Since the relationship existed before the parents married, and the parents' marriage changed the dynamics, it's possible that the author isn't inherently in the wrong, but the situation is complicated by the family's actions.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards B (No), but there might be nuances. However, the key point is that the author isn't in the wrong per se, as there's no legal issue, and the relationship is consensual and between adults. The parents' actions are the main source of conflict, not the author's decision to stay with his girlfriend.\n"
