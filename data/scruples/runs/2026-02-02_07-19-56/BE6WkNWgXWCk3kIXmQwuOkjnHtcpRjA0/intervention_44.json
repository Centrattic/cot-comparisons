We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.\n\nIt's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.\n\nHonestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says \"go tell your sister x\". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to \"What did you expect from the crazy bitch?\" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.\n\nThis living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nAITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your \"stepsister\" who you live with?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to break up with their girlfriend, who is also their stepsister. The situation is that they've been together since they were 14, parents married when they were 20, leading to a complicated living situation. The parents are trying to break them up by calling them brother and sister, and the couple wants to stay together until they can move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the age of consent and the relationship being legal in their state would matter. Since they're 20 and in a state college, assuming they're in the US, the legality varies by state. Some states prohibit marriage between step-siblings, while others don't. If it's legal, then there's no legal issue. However, even if it's legal, there might be social stigma or family pressure, which isn't the same as being \"in the wrong.\"\n\nEthically, the question is whether the relationship is inappropriate given their living situation. They live in the same house with their parents, which complicates things. The parents' behavior is problematic, trying to undermine the relationship. The couple is mature, in love, and planning for the future. They want to stay together until they can move out. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because of the step-sibling relationship. However, if the couple is consenting, in love, and the issue is external pressure from family, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The key point is whether the relationship itself is harmful or forced. Since both parties are adults, in a consensual relationship, and the problem is external family interference, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the parents' actions of trying to break them up and making them feel ashamed might be the real issue here. The couple's desire to continue despite the challenges could be seen as valid. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
