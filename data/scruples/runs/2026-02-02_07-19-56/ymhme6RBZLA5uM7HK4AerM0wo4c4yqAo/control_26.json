There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who posted this is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user works at their parents' bar and grill/cafe, which is known for meat-heavy dishes. They're hiring a new head chef, and a vegan candidate applied. The candidate is a recent culinary grad with no job experience but a strict vegan diet. The user was concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat dishes, which the candidate wouldn't eat. The user decided not to hire her, leading to some backlash.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, you can't discriminate based on religion, race, gender, etc. But dietary preferences like veganism might not fall under protected classes unless it's part of a religious or medical belief. However, the user isn't rejecting her because of her veganism itself, but because it conflicts with the job requirements. The job requires tasting meat dishes, which the candidate refuses to do. If the job requires certain tasks that the candidate can't perform due to personal beliefs, that's a valid reason for not hiring them. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to accommodate? The candidate suggested having someone else taste the dishes, but the user's parents explained that the chef needs to do it themselves because of the busy environment and the importance of the chef's role. It's possible that the core duties of the job can't be delegated, making the candidate unsuitable. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user is turning down a qualified candidate solely because of their dietary preferences without considering flexibility, that could be an issue. However, in this case, the candidate's refusal to taste meat dishes directly impacts their ability to perform a key job function. The user is in a position where they need someone who can work within the existing menu structure. \n\nAlso, the candidate didn't have any job experience, which might be a factor. But the user considered her a recent grad, so lack of experience isn't the main issue here. The main conflict is the dietary restriction conflicting with job duties.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, if the job requires tasting meat dishes and the candidate can't do that, it's reasonable to not hire them. The user isn't discriminating based on protected characteristics but making a business decision based on job requirements. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
