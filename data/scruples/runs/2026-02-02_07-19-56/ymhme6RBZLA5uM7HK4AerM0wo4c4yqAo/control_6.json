There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef for a meat-heavy restaurant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant's main dishes are meat-based, with very few vegetarian options. The author is handling the hiring process for the head chef position, which requires tasting the food, including meat dishes. The candidate is a strict vegan and wouldn't eat meat. She suggested having someone else taste the food, but the author rejected that because the head chef must do the final tasting in a busy kitchen.\n\nSo, the key points here are the job requirements and the candidate's ability to meet them. The head chef's role includes tasting all dishes, which for this restaurant are mostly meat-based. Since the candidate is vegan, she can't taste the meat dishes herself, and the author believes that having someone else do it isn't feasible. That seems like a legitimate job requirement. \n\nDiscrimination laws typically prohibit bias based on religion, race, gender, etc., but dietary preferences like veganism aren't always protected under the same categories. However, in some places, veganism is considered a philosophical belief, which might offer some protection. But the main issue here is whether the restaurant can make a business decision based on the job's essential functions.\n\nThe author is choosing not to hire someone who can't perform a key duty of the job. That's a valid business decision. The candidate's personal preferences are important, but if they conflict with the job's requirements, the employer isn't necessarily in the wrong. The author's decision is based on the necessity of the chef to taste all dishes, which is crucial for quality control. \n\nAlso, the candidate didn't have prior experience, which might have been a factor, but the main issue is her inability to perform a key task. The author's reasoning seems justified here. Therefore, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
