There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. So the situation is about hiring a new chef for a grill/cafe that's mostly meat-based. The candidate is a vegan with no experience, and the author decided not to hire her because she's vegan and wouldn't eat meat. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, the key points are the restaurant's focus on meat. They have very few vegan options, so a chef who's vegan might not be able to taste the main dishes properly. The author mentions that the head chef needs to do final taste tests, which is crucial for quality control. The vegan chef said she wouldn't eat meat, so she couldn't taste the dishes herself. The author argues that this would make her unfit for the job.\n\nNow, considering employment laws and discrimination. In many places, employers can have job requirements based on the job's nature. For example, a chef at a steakhouse might be expected to work with meat. Being vegan is a personal choice, but if the job inherently requires handling or tasting meat, then the candidate's refusal might be a valid reason not to hire them. However, there's also the aspect of dietary restrictions being a protected category in some contexts, but I'm not sure if that applies here. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the candidate didn't have any job experience, which isn't necessarily a problem. The main issue is compatibility with the job's requirements. The author's reasoning is that the chef needs to taste the meat-based dishes, which a vegan wouldn't do. So the author isn't discriminating based on protected characteristics like race or gender but is making a business decision based on the job's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate might argue that her veganism is a personal choice and should be accommodated. But the restaurant's business model is built around meat. It's a matter of whether the job requires tasting meat dishes, which in a steakhouse-style place it likely does. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes, that's a problem for quality control. So the author's decision is based on practical job requirements rather than bias against veganism.\n\nAdditionally, the author is handling the hiring process for a family business where the mother is retiring. They have a reputation to maintain, and the new chef needs to fit into the existing operations. The author isn't being discriminatory; they're making a decision based on the specific needs of the position. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the job requires tasting meat-based dishes, and the candidate's refusal to eat meat makes her unsuitable for the role. It's a legitimate business decision based on the job's requirements, not discrimination.\n"
