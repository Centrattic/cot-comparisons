There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author works at a bar and grill that's known for meat dishes, with only a single vegan option. They're hiring a new head chef because their mom is retiring. A vegan candidate applied, but the author turned her down because she wouldn't eat meat and couldn't taste the meat dishes. The candidate had a meltdown and the friend was upset, calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about job requirements. The head chef's role includes tasting and quality control. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes because they're vegan, that's a problem for the job's core responsibilities. The restaurant's reputation and customer expectations rely on their meat dishes. The author's concern is valid because the chef's refusal to taste the food might compromise the quality control. \n\nOn the other hand, the candidate might argue that she's qualified and deserves a chance, but the job's specific needs require a chef who can taste the main offerings. The author isn't discriminating based on protected categories like race or gender, but rather based on the job's requirements. The candidate's veganism is a personal choice, and the restaurant isn't obligated to hire someone whose dietary preferences don't align with the job's needs. \n\nThe author gave her a fair chance, considered her application, and decided she wasn't a fit. The friend's reaction is a bit harsh, but the author's reasoning is job-related. So, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong here. They made a business decision based on the restaurant's needs and the role's requirements. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
