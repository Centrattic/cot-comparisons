There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong when they refused to hire a vegan chef for a meat-heavy restaurant. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant is known for meat-based dishes. The chef position is for someone who would take over from the retiring head chef. The candidate is a vegan, no experience, and during the interview, she emphasized her veganism, even when asked how she'd handle tasting meat dishes. She suggested someone else could do the tasting, but the author thought that wouldn't work because the chef needs to taste everything for quality control.\n\nThe key points here are: the restaurant's business model relies heavily on meat, the chef's role requires tasting all dishes, and the candidate's dietary restrictions might conflict with that. The author decided not to hire her because of this. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the restaurant's reputation is based on meat dishes. The chef needs to be able to taste everything to ensure quality. A vegan chef who can't eat meat might not be able to properly evaluate the meat dishes, which are central to the restaurant's offerings. The author might think that a chef's ability to taste all the dishes is crucial, so refusing to hire someone who can't do that makes sense for the business's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being discriminatory against vegans. However, dietary preferences like veganism are different from protected classes such as race, gender, religion, etc., so legally, it's not discrimination. But ethically, is it fair? The candidate might have had the skills but couldn't meet the specific requirements of the job. The author is looking for someone who can fulfill all the duties of the position, including tasting meat dishes. If the candidate can't do that, maybe the author is justified in not hiring them.\n\nAlso, the candidate had no job experience, which could be a factor. The author might have considered that a lack of experience is a bigger issue, but the main point of contention is the veganism affecting the tasting requirement. If the job requires tasting meat dishes, and the candidate refuses to do so, that's a legitimate reason to not hire them, regardless of their dietary preferences. The author isn't forcing the candidate to eat meat; they're requiring the chef to taste the dishes, which are meat-based. The candidate's refusal to taste the meat dishes would compromise the restaurant's quality control.\n\nAnother angle is whether there's a way to accommodate the candidate. For example, could someone else do the tasting? But the author argues that during busy times, the chef needs to be hands-on and can't rely on others. Plus, the chef's role in quality control is personal and can't be delegated. So the author's decision is based on job requirements, not prejudice.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown, being called an asshole) might suggest that she felt wronged, but the author's reasoning is about job fit. The author isn't at fault for making a business decision based on the needs of the restaurant. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
