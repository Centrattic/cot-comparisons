There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the business is known for its meat-heavy menu with very few vegan options. The parent's bar and grill has been successful that way for a decade. The author is handling the hiring for a head chef position, which is crucial because the current head chef is retiring. The candidate is a vegan with no culinary experience, which might be a red flag for not having the necessary skills in a meat-focused kitchen.\n\nThe candidate's strict veganism could conflict with the job requirements, like tasting meat dishes. The author mentions that the chef must taste all dishes for quality control, which is a key part of the role. The candidate suggested having someone else do the tasting, but the author rightly points out that the chef is responsible for that. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes, their ability to perform the job effectively is compromised.\n\nAlso, the candidate had a meltdown and the friend called the author an asshole. While it's good to consider diversity, the job requires specific skills and responsibilities that the candidate might not be able to fulfill due to dietary restrictions. The author isn't discriminating based on religion or ethical beliefs but is making a practical decision based on job requirements.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a business decision to ensure the new chef can perform all necessary duties, especially in a meat-heavy establishment where tasting and understanding the dishes is essential. The candidate's lack of experience is another factor, but the veganism itself is a valid reason here because of the role's requirements.\n"
