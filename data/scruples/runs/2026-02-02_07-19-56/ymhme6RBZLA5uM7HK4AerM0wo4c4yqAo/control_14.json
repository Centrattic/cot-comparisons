There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person works at their parents' bar and grill that serves a lot of meat-based dishes. They're responsible for hiring a new head chef after their mother retires. A candidate, a recent culinary grad, came in for an interview but is a strict vegan. She didn't have job experience, only college. The concern here is that she's vegan and the restaurant is heavily meat-focused. The key issue is that the chef needs to taste all dishes, including meat-based ones, for quality control, but she can't do that. They rejected her, and she had a meltdown. The friend who recommended her is upset, calling the author an asshole. The author feels bad but thinks she wouldn't fit in.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for not hiring the vegan chef?\n\nFirst, I need to consider employment law. Can a business discriminate based on dietary preferences? Probably not. But there's also the aspect of job requirements. The head chef must be able to taste all the food, especially meat dishes. If the candidate is vegan and refuses to eat meat, that's a problem. The restaurant has a specific need that the candidate can't fulfill. So, the author is hiring someone for a role that requires tasting meat dishes, and the candidate can't do that. Therefore, it's a legitimate job requirement.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have considered if there's a way to accommodate the candidate. But the response was that the chef can't just delegate tasting to someone else during busy times. The head chef is responsible for all final tastings. If the candidate can't perform that duty, the restaurant is justified in rejecting her. \n\nAlso, the candidate didn't have any job experience, which is another factor. The author considers that not a dealbreaker, but it's a valid point. The combination of no experience and inability to fulfill a key job function (tasting meat dishes) leads to the decision. \n\nThe author's friend is upset, but the restaurant's needs come first. The author isn't in the wrong because they're fulfilling a necessary job requirement. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
