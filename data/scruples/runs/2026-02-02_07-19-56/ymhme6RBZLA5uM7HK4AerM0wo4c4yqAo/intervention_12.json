There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about refusing to hire a vegan chef for a restaurant that's mostly meat-based. The author is a manager helping to hire a new head chef. The candidate is a vegan culinary grad with no experience, and during the interview, when asked about tasting meat dishes, she suggests having someone else do it. The author decides not to hire her, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to think about employment laws and discrimination. In many places, employers can't discriminate based on personal characteristics like religion, race, gender, etc., but dietary preferences like being vegan aren't typically protected categories. However, there might be nuances. For example, if the veganism is tied to a religious belief, that could be different. But the question here is more about the author's decision based on the job requirements.\n\nThe job as a head chef involves tasting meat dishes, which is a legitimate requirement for quality control. The candidate's refusal to taste meat would make it impossible for her to fulfill that role effectively. The author's reasoning is that the chef needs to taste every dish, and relying on someone else would compromise the process. That seems like a valid business decision. Employers can set job requirements based on the role's needs, even if it excludes certain candidates.\n\nHowever, could there be a way to accommodate the vegan chef? Maybe if the chef could taste non-meat dishes and have a deputy or assistant handle the meat tasting. But the restaurant is already very meat-focused with minimal vegan options. The author mentions only one veggie platter, so the majority of the menu is meat-based. It's unclear if there's a role for a vegan chef here beyond that one dish. The author might not have a position that aligns with the candidate's dietary restrictions.\n\nAnother angle is the friend who recommended the candidate. The author's friend is upset, calling the author an asshole. That might indicate social pressure, but the decision is based on job fit. The author also considered giving her a chance but found the candidate's solution inadequate. The meltdown and hanging up might be the candidate's reaction, but the author isn't responsible for that.\n\nIn terms of workplace discrimination, unless the candidate's veganism is a protected class (which it's not in most legal frameworks), the author isn't violating any laws. The job requires tasting meat, and the candidate can't fulfill that duty. Therefore, the author's decision is based on legitimate job requirements, not personal bias. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
