There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when the restaurant is mostly meat-based.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The restaurant is a bar and grill/cafe with a focus on meat dishes. They have very few vegetarian options, just a veggie platter. The author is handling the hiring for the new head chef position, replacing the mother who's retiring. A vegan culinary grad applied, but since the restaurant is meat-heavy, the author was concerned about her ability to taste and manage meat dishes, which she said she wouldn't eat. The author turned her down, saying she's better suited elsewhere. The applicant had a meltdown.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is right or not. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nLet me think. Legally, there's no law against not hiring someone based on dietary preferences unless there's discrimination involved. But in terms of ethics or fairness, is the author justified?\n\nThe restaurant's identity is built around meat. The head chef needs to manage taste tests and quality control for meat dishes. The candidate's veganism would make it hard for her to do that. If she can't taste the meat dishes, the restaurant's standards might suffer. The author's reasoning is practical: the job requires tasting meat dishes, and the candidate's personal beliefs conflict with that essential job function. So it's a legitimate concern, not discrimination. The author didn't reject her based on her veganism per se but because it would interfere with her job responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the employer could have been more accommodating, like having someone else taste the meat dishes on her behalf. But the author mentions that the kitchen gets very busy and everyone has specific roles. The head chef is responsible for the final tasting, which is crucial. If the candidate refuses to do that, maybe it's a red flag. The author's parents and the existing team might not be comfortable with someone who doesn't eat meat, which is part of the restaurant's core offerings.\n\nAlso, the applicant's meltdown and the friend's reaction are more about the outcome than the decision's validity. The author's reasoning is based on the job's requirements, not personal bias. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They made a business decision based on the needs of the restaurant. So the answer should be B.\n"
