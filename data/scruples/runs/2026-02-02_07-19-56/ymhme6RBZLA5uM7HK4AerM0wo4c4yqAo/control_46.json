There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when their restaurant focuses mostly on meat-based dishes.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The restaurant is a bar and grill with a lot of meat dishes, only one vegetarian option. The position is for head chef, which is a key role. The candidate is a vegan with no professional experience outside of culinary school. During the interview, she mentions being a strict vegan and her favorite dishes are vegan. The manager is concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat-based dishes, but the candidate says someone else can do it. The manager decides not to hire her, leading to her meltdown and friends calling the manager an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the manager is at fault. \n\nFrom the restaurant's perspective, the head chef needs to taste the food, especially meat dishes, which are the core of their menu. If the chef can't or won't taste the food, that's a problem for quality control. The restaurant's reputation relies on their meat dishes, so having a chef who isn't willing to engage with those dishes might be a legitimate concern. The manager is prioritizing the restaurant's needs and the specific requirements of the job. \n\nOn the other hand, the candidate is vegan and might not have experience in a meat-heavy kitchen. But the manager isn't saying she's unqualified for lack of experience; the issue is her dietary restrictions conflicting with job duties. The manager is being honest about the job requirements. The candidate might have thought she could adapt, but the core responsibility of tasting meat is essential here. \n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown) and the friend's anger might indicate they felt discriminated against, but the manager is not discriminating based on protected categories like race or gender. The decision is based on job performance requirements. \n\nSo the manager is making a judgment call based on the job's needs. The AITA community often considers whether the action is a jerk move. In this case, the manager is being professional and honest, not being discriminatory, and making a business decision. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
