There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when the restaurant is mostly meat-based.\n\nFirst, the author is a manager helping to hire a new head chef. The restaurant is known for meat dishes and has very few vegan options. The candidate is a vegan with no experience but a culinary degree. During the interview, the candidate's veganism becomes clear. The author is concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat dishes, which the candidate can't do. The author declines the candidate, and the candidate reacts negatively.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the facts. The restaurant's main menu is meat-heavy, and the head chef's role includes tasting and quality control. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes because they're vegan, that could be a problem for the job requirements. The author is prioritizing the restaurant's needs and customer expectations. However, refusing to hire someone purely based on their dietary preferences without considering their ability to adapt or manage the role could be discriminatory. \n\nBut wait, the job requires tasting meat dishes, which is essential for quality. Since the candidate is vegan and won't eat meat, they can't fulfill that part of the job. The author is making a business decision based on the role's requirements. However, the author could have explored alternatives, like the candidate supervising others for tasting, but the candidate suggested having someone else do it, which the author rejected. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because the job's essential functions can't be compromised. The candidate's meltdown might be an overreaction, but the author's decision is based on the restaurant's needs.\n"
