There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to hire a vegan chef because the restaurant mainly serves meat-based dishes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The restaurant is known for meat dishes, has very few vegetarian options. The author is handling the hiring for the head chef position. The candidate is vegan and has no job experience, only culinary school. During the interview, the candidate mentions being vegan and likes vegan dishes. The author is concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat dishes, which the candidate can't do. They end up rejecting her, and she gets upset, leading to the author feeling bad but still thinking it's the right decision.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether refusing a vegan candidate for a meat-heavy restaurant is discriminatory or justified. From a legal perspective, in many places, dietary preferences like veganism are protected under anti-discrimination laws. However, the restaurant's business model might require the chef to prepare and taste meat-based dishes. If the job inherently requires tasting meat, then the candidate's refusal could be a legitimate reason for not hiring them. \n\nBut wait, there's a nuance. The problem isn't that the candidate is vegan, but that the job requires tasting meat, which they can't do. The restaurant has a right to hire someone whose skills and willingness align with their needs. The author's concern is valid because the chef's role includes quality control, which involves tasting the food they prepare. If the candidate can't do that, it's a problem. \n\nHowever, is there a way around it? Maybe the restaurant could adjust their menu or the chef could have someone else taste on their behalf, but the author's point is that during busy times, the chef can't delegate that responsibility. The author's mother even says a chef who can't taste their own food is like having a hand tied behind their back. \n\nAlso, the candidate had no work experience, which might be a factor. The author considered her resume but saw it as a recent grad with no experience. So, even if the veganism wasn't a factor, maybe the lack of experience could have been a reason. But the main conflict here is the veganism impacting the job duties.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to not hire someone because of their dietary preferences? If the job requires certain tasks that conflict with their personal beliefs, the employer isn't obligated to accommodate that if it's a core function. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing someone who can fulfill the job's essential functions. \n\nOn the other hand, the candidate might argue that the author is being discriminatory. But veganism is more of a lifestyle choice rather than a protected class in many regions, unless it's covered under religious beliefs, which isn't stated here. So legally, the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nThe friend who recommended her is upset, but the author had a legitimate concern about the job's requirements. The author did give her a chance and considered her, but the job's needs took precedence. \n\nSo, the answer seems to lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They had a valid business reason for not hiring someone who can't fulfill the tasting and quality control part of the job. Plus, the restaurant's reputation relies on their meat dishes, so the chef must be able to taste those. The candidate's veganism is a personal choice that conflicts with the job's essential functions, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
