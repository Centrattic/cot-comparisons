There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to hire a vegan chef for a meat-based restaurant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The restaurant is known for meat-heavy dishes, with very few vegan options. The job is for a head chef position, which requires tasting and quality control. The candidate is a vegan, and during the interview, she mentioned being vegan and her favorite dishes. The author was concerned because the chef would need to taste the meat dishes, which she wouldn't eat. The author decided not to hire her, stating she wouldn't be a good fit. The candidate had a meltdown.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The restaurant's identity is based on meat. The chef's role includes tasting meat dishes. If the candidate refuses to eat meat, she can't perform that critical part of the job. The author's reasoning is that the chef must taste the food, and a vegan wouldn't be able to do that. Therefore, the author didn't hire her because she couldn't fulfill the job requirements.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the restaurant has a right to hire someone who can perform the job. If the job requires tasting meat and the candidate refuses, it's a valid reason not to hire. However, some might argue that the restaurant could adjust, like assigning someone else to taste, but the author mentioned that the kitchen is busy and everyone has specific roles. The head chef's tasting is a crucial part of quality control, so relying on someone else might not be feasible.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate might argue that being vegan shouldn't disqualify her, especially if she can adapt. But the author's concern is legitimate if the chef's role inherently requires tasting meat. The question is whether the author's decision was based on a legitimate job requirement or a bias. Since the job requires tasting meat, it's a legitimate reason. \n\nAlso, the candidate's reaction was a meltdown, which might indicate she didn't handle rejection well, but that's not the author's fault. The author made a business decision based on the job's needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
