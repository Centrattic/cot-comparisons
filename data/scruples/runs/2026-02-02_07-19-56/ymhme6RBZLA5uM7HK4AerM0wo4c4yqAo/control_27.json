There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong for not hiring a vegan chef when the restaurant is mostly meat-based.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's main menu is focused on meat dishes, with very few vegetarian or vegan options. The new chef candidate is a strict vegan, which could be a problem for a place that relies heavily on meat. The key points here are job requirements versus personal ethics.\n\nThe chef's role includes tasting and quality control. If the candidate is vegan and refuses to eat meat, they might not be able to taste the meat dishes effectively, which is crucial for maintaining the restaurant's standards. The author mentions that during the interview, the candidate suggested having someone else taste the meat dishes, but the author rejected that idea because of the fast-paced environment. That makes sense because the head chef should be directly involved in tasting everything.\n\nThe candidate had no job experience, which might not be a dealbreaker, but their dietary restrictions could conflict with the job's essential functions. The author's parents have built the restaurant's reputation around meat dishes, so hiring someone who can't taste those dishes could compromise the business's success.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown and hanging up) might indicate they felt the interview was unfair. However, the author's decision is based on the job's requirements, not discrimination. The restaurant isn't violating any laws by choosing a chef who can perform all necessary duties. There's no indication that the author is discriminating based on a protected category; they're making a business decision based on the job's needs.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a fair assessment based on the job's requirements. The answer should be B.\n"
