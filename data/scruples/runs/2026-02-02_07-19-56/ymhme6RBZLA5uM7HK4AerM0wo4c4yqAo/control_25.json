There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when the establishment mostly serves meat-based dishes. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author works at their parents' bar and grill, which has a meat-heavy menu. They're in charge of hiring for the head chef position, which is being vacated by their mother. A candidate, a recent culinary grad who's a strict vegan, applied. During the interview, she mentioned her veganism and favorite dishes, which are all vegan. The author was concerned because the restaurant's core is meat-based, and the chef needs to taste the dishes. The candidate suggested someone else could taste the food, but the author felt that wouldn't work because of the busy environment and the importance of the chef's role in quality control. They decided not to hire her, and the candidate was upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's decision was discriminatory or reasonable. The candidate is a vegan, and the restaurant's menu doesn't cater to veganism. The author argues that the chef needs to taste the food, which is mostly meat-based, and that the candidate's refusal to eat meat would hinder her ability to perform the job effectively. \n\nI need to consider employment law. In many places, refusing to hire someone based on their dietary preferences (like veganism) isn't a protected class. Discrimination is typically based on race, gender, religion, etc. Unless the candidate's veganism is tied to a protected characteristic, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the job requires tasting meat-based dishes, which is a legitimate job requirement. If the candidate can't perform that essential function, the author isn't obligated to hire them. The candidate's lack of experience might also be a factor, though the author didn't mention that as the main reason. \n\nThe candidate's reaction was a meltdown, which might be emotional, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The author's reasoning is based on the job's requirements and the restaurant's nature. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have been more open-minded, considering the candidate's potential to adapt or bring new ideas. But the job's core is meat-based, and the chef's role includes tasting, which is crucial. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong because they're making a business decision based on job requirements and the restaurant's needs. The candidate's veganism isn't a protected category, and the author's concerns about the chef's ability to perform the job are valid.\n"
