There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when the restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a manager helping to hire a new head chef. Their parent's restaurant is known for meat dishes, like steak, burgers, etc., with almost no vegan options. They hired a vegan chef candidate who had no prior work experience but was a recent culinary grad. The candidate was strict vegan, and when asked how she'd handle tasting meat dishes, she suggested having someone else do it. The author felt that wouldn't work because the chef needs to taste everything for quality control. They decided not to hire her, leading to the candidate's meltdown and friends calling the author an asshole. The author is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the restaurant's menu focus versus the chef's dietary preferences. The author's main concern is that the chef wouldn't be able to properly taste and oversee the meat-based dishes, which are central to the restaurant's identity. The chef candidate's position as a vegan might make it difficult for her to effectively perform the job, especially in a role that requires tasting and quality control.\n\nBut wait, is it discrimination based on dietary preferences? Veganism is a personal choice, not a protected class in most places. However, if the job requires handling or tasting meat dishes, then the candidate's refusal could be a legitimate reason for not hiring. The author is choosing someone who can perform the job as required. The restaurant has a specific menu, so the head chef should align with that. The candidate might not have the necessary skills or willingness to work with the existing menu. The author could be looking for someone who can manage a meat-heavy menu, not a vegan one. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate might argue that she's qualified in culinary arts and could adapt the menu to include some vegan options, but the restaurant's reputation is built on meat. Also, the author mentioned they have only one vegetarian dish, so the candidate's expertise might not fit. The author's decision seems based on job requirements, not on prejudice against veganism. The candidate's inability or unwillingness to taste meat dishes would hinder her ability to perform the role effectively. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
