There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, the restaurant's main focus is on meat-heavy dishes, which is clearly stated. The author is a manager handling the hiring process. The candidate is a vegan with no culinary job experience but has a degree. During the interview, the candidate mentions being a strict vegan and talks about vegan dishes. The author is concerned about the chef needing to taste the meat dishes, which the candidate can't do. The restaurant requires the head chef to do final tastings and quality control, which is crucial. The candidate suggests having someone else taste the food, but the author and parents decide not to hire her, leading to a meltdown from the candidate and some backlash from friends.\n\nLegally, in the US, refusing to hire someone because of their dietary preferences (veganism) isn't a protected class under discrimination laws. So there's no legal wrong here. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author is running a business that serves mostly meat, so requiring the chef to be able to taste and oversee meat-based dishes makes sense. The candidate didn't have experience, which is a valid concern. The author's reasoning is that the chef needs to be comfortable with the restaurant's menu to perform the job effectively. \n\nThe candidate's objection is about personal beliefs, but if the job requires tasting meat, then refusing to do so would make them unsuitable. The author's decision is based on job requirements and the need for the chef to be fully engaged in the kitchen's operations. The candidate's meltdown and the friend's anger might indicate they didn't consider the business's needs. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they're making a decision based on the job's essential functions, not on discrimination. The answer should be B (No).\n"
