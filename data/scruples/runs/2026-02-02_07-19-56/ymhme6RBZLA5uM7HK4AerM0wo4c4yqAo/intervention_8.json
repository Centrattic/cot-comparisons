There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef because their restaurant is mostly meat-based. \n\nFirst, the restaurant has a long-standing reputation based on meat dishes, with very few vegan options. The author is a manager helping to hire the next head chef. The candidate is vegan, has no work experience, and during the interview, it's clear she's not comfortable with meat. The author is concerned she can't taste the meat dishes and might not be a good fit. They decide not to hire her, leading to a backlash from the candidate and her friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are about job fit and discrimination. The author argues that the chef needs to taste all dishes for quality control, especially since the restaurant is meat-focused. The vegan chef wouldn't be able to do that, which could be a valid job requirement. However, the candidate might argue that the restaurant's refusal is based on her dietary preferences, which could be considered a form of discrimination if it's not a legitimate job requirement.\n\nBut in the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act covers discrimination based on religion, race, color, national origin, and sex. Veganism isn't protected under federal law, though some states might have different laws. So, unless there's a state law that protects dietary preferences as part of a protected class, the restaurant isn't legally in the wrong here. \n\nFrom a business perspective, the author is looking for a chef who can manage all aspects of the kitchen, including tasting meat-based dishes. The candidate's veganism might interfere with that essential function. So, the author is making a business decision based on job requirements. The candidate's meltdown and the friend's outrage might be about personal values, but the restaurant isn't obligated to accommodate the chef's preferences if it conflicts with necessary job duties.\n\nHowever, some might say that in today's diverse market, a restaurant could consider adapting their menu to include more options. But the user's scenario states that the restaurant has built its reputation on meat dishes and has only one vegan option. Changing that might not align with their business model and customer expectations. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a decision based on job requirements and the restaurant's identity. The refusal is about job fit, not discrimination. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
