There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, the context: The place is a bar and grill/cafe that's known for meat-heavy dishes. They have very few vegan options. The author, a high-ranking manager, is involved in hiring a new head chef. A job candidate is a strict vegan with no professional experience, only culinary school. During the interview, the candidate makes it clear she's vegan and talks about her favorite vegan dishes. When asked how she'd taste meat dishes without eating them, she says someone else can do it, but the author is concerned about quality control and the importance of the head chef tasting their own food. They decline the offer, and the candidate reacts negatively.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me consider the factors.\n\nFrom one angle, the business has a specific menu and reputation. The head chef needs to oversee all dishes, including tasting them. If the chef refuses to taste meat (because of dietary restrictions), that could compromise the quality and standard of the food. The author might be right in thinking that someone who can't or won't taste the meat dishes wouldn't be a good fit for the job. It's about job requirements and the practicality of the role. The business might not be able to accommodate a strict vegan chef given their menu and operational needs. So, the author's decision is based on the job's requirements and the necessity for the chef to be able to taste all dishes to maintain quality.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is discriminatory. The candidate was applying for a job as a chef, which is a professional role, and the refusal is based on her dietary preferences (veganism) and not her skills. However, in this case, the ability to taste the food is a legitimate job requirement. The chef needs to ensure that all dishes, including meat-based ones, meet the restaurant's standards. If the candidate can't or won't taste them, that's a valid concern. So it's not about her being vegan per se, but her inability to fulfill a key duty of the role.\n\nAnother point is that the candidate didn't have job experience, which might have been a factor. But the author mentions that lack of experience isn't a dealbreaker. The main issue was the tasting of meat. The author's concern is practical. The chef's role requires tasting all dishes, and without that, the quality control is compromised. Therefore, the author's decision is reasonable because it's about the job's requirements, not discrimination against her personal beliefs.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown and hanging up) and the friend's anger might suggest that the author's decision was perceived as unfair. But the author is prioritizing the business's needs and the role's demands. So, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
