There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, the restaurant's primary focus is on meat-based dishes, and they have only one vegan option. The author, as a manager, is responsible for hiring. They interviewed a vegan chef who has no job experience but is a recent culinary grad. The chef is strict vegan and wouldn't eat meat, which is a problem because the head chef needs to taste the meat dishes for quality control.\n\nThe author's concern is that if the chef can't taste the meat dishes, the quality control would be compromised. The chef suggested having someone else taste, but the author rejected that because the kitchen is busy and everyone has specific roles. The author ended up rejecting the candidate, leading to a meltdown from the candidate and criticism from the friend.\n\nSo, the key points are: the restaurant's menu is mostly meat, the chef's dietary restrictions conflict with the job requirements, and the author decided not to hire based on that. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't explicitly covered under the same protections as race, gender, etc. However, if the veganism is a protected characteristic in their area, that could be a factor. But in many cases, dietary choices aren't considered protected. \n\nThe author is making a business decision based on the job's requirements. The head chef needs to taste the food, which includes meat. The vegan chef can't do that, so they wouldn't be suitable. It's about job performance, not discrimination. The author is choosing someone who can fulfill the role's essential functions. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the restaurant could adapt by adding more vegan options, but the user mentions that the business has a reputation for meat-based dishes and their parent's input suggests they don't want to change. The author isn't obligated to hire someone who can't perform the job's core duties. \n\nThe friend's reaction is emotional, but the author's decision is reasonable given the circumstances. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
