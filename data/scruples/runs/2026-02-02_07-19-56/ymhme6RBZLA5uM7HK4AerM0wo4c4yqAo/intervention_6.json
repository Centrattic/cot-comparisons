There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is a manager at their parents' bar and grill/cafe, which is known for meat-based dishes. They're looking to hire a new head chef. A vegan culinary grad applies and is interviewed. The candidate is vegan and has no job experience. The author is concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat dishes, which the candidate won't eat. The author declines the candidate, leading to a meltdown and accusations of being an asshole. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the business's primary focus is meat-heavy cuisine, the need for the head chef to taste test dishes as part of quality control, the candidate's strict veganism making it impossible to taste meat dishes, and the author's decision to not hire her for that reason.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to determine the right answer.\n\nFirst, employment law considerations. In many places, employers can set job requirements based on the job's essential functions. If tasting the meat dishes is a necessary part of the job, then requiring the candidate to be able to do that is legitimate. The candidate's veganism, while a personal choice, might not override the business's operational needs here. So, the author isn't necessarily violating any anti-discrimination laws because veganism isn't a protected class in most jurisdictions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not hiring someone who can't perform a core job function.\n\nHowever, one could argue that the author should have been more flexible. Maybe the candidate could have found a way to taste the dishes without compromising their veganism, but the scenario states that the candidate refuses to eat meat entirely. The author's role is to ensure the kitchen runs smoothly, and a head chef not tasting the food would be problematic. The author's parents run a meat-focused establishment, and they need someone who can oversee the cooking and tasting. So, the author is making a business decision based on the job's requirements.\n\nOn the other hand, if the candidate had experience in meat-based cooking but was vegan for personal reasons, maybe there's a different angle. But in this case, the candidate has no experience and is strictly vegan. The author is looking for someone who can manage the existing menu, not overhaul it into vegan-friendly. The author isn't discriminating based on protected characteristics but is assessing the candidate's ability to perform the job as it is.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they're evaluating the candidate's suitability for the specific job requirements. The job needs someone who can taste and manage meat dishes, and the candidate's veganism makes that impossible. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
