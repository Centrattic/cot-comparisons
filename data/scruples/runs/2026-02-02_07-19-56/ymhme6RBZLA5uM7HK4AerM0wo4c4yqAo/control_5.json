There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author declining to hire a vegan chef for a meat-heavy restaurant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant is known for meat-based dishes, with very few vegetarian options. The candidate is a strict vegan with no work experience. The author is responsible for hiring and decided not to hire her because of dietary preferences. The candidate was upset, leading to conflict.\n\nThe question is about whether the author was in the wrong. The restaurant's business model relies heavily on meat, so it's reasonable to expect a chef who can work within that framework. The author's role is to ensure the new head chef can manage the kitchen effectively, including tasting meat-based dishes for quality control. The vegan chef's refusal to taste meat would be a problem because the chef's role requires overseeing all dishes. \n\nDiscrimination laws might come into play here, but dietary preferences like veganism are not the same as protected classes (race, gender, etc.). However, some might argue that refusing to hire based on dietary preferences could be seen as bias. But in this case, the author isn't discriminating against a protected group but rather making a business decision based on job requirements. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the chef needs to taste the food, including meat, which is essential for the job. The candidate didn't have the necessary experience, which could be another factor. The author could be seen as protecting the business's standards and reputation by hiring someone who can fully commit to the menu.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate might feel it's unfair to be rejected solely based on dietary preferences. But since the job requires working with meat, which the candidate refuses to consume, it's a valid concern for the business. The author's decision is based on the practical needs of the restaurant rather than personal prejudice.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a business decision that aligns with the restaurant's needs. The key is that the job requires tasting meat, which the candidate can't do, making her unsuitable for the role. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
