There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The bar and grill/cafe has a meat-heavy menu, with only one vegetarian option. They need a new head chef, and a candidate applies. The candidate is a strict vegan and has no professional experience. The author interviews her and finds out she's vegan. They're concerned because the head chef needs to taste the food, including meat dishes. The candidate suggests having someone else taste the dishes, but the author decides not to hire her, explaining she's a better fit elsewhere. The candidate gets upset and the friend is angry.\n\nNow, the key points here are the business's needs versus the candidate's dietary preferences. The business requires a chef who can manage a meat-heavy menu and perform quality control, which includes tasting the food. The candidate's veganism would prevent her from tasting meat dishes, which is a critical part of the job. The author's reasoning is that without tasting, the chef can't properly oversee the food quality, which is essential in a busy kitchen. \n\nIs it discrimination? Well, dietary preferences like being vegan aren't typically protected classes under employment law in the US, unlike race or gender. However, the business has the right to hire someone who can fulfill the job requirements. If the job requires tasting meat, and the candidate can't do that, it's a legitimate reason to not hire them. \n\nThe candidate might have faced challenges finding work, but the business isn't obligated to provide job opportunities that don't align with their operational needs. The author's decision is based on the practical necessity of the role, not on the candidate's personal beliefs. The author did consider her, gave her a chance, and then decided based on the job's requirements. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they made a business decision based on the essential functions of the job. The answer should be B (No).\n"
