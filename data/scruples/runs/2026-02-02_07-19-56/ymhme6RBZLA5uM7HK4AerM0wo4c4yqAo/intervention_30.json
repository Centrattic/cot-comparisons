There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a manager at their parents' bar and grill/cafe that serves a lot of meat-based dishes. They were interviewing a vegan candidate for a chef position. The candidate has no job experience but a culinary degree. During the interview, it became clear she's a strict vegan and prefers vegan dishes. The author was concerned about her ability to taste meat-based dishes, which are the staple of the business. The candidate suggested having someone else taste the food, but the author felt that the chef should be responsible for tasting all dishes for quality control. They decided not to hire her, leading to the candidate's upset reaction and accusations from the friend.\n\nNow, considering the question: is the author in the wrong? The key points here are employment practices, discrimination, and job requirements. The author's business is meat-centric, so the chef needs to be able to taste and manage meat dishes. The candidate's veganism might conflict with the job's essential functions. However, under labor laws in many places, refusing to hire someone based on dietary preferences or veganism could be considered a form of discrimination unless it's a bona fide occupational qualification.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the chef must taste all dishes, including meat, for quality. If the candidate can't do that, it's a legitimate job requirement. The author isn't discriminating based on race, gender, or religion, but rather on the ability to perform a key job function. However, some might argue that the business should be open to adapting, like offering some vegan options or allowing a vegan chef to manage both meat and vegan dishes while respecting their beliefs.\n\nBut the business has a long-standing reputation on meat-based dishes. It might not be feasible to change the menu significantly, especially if it's a family-run business. The author's decision is based on the candidate's inability to meet the job's core requirements. The candidate didn't mention any accommodations needed, and the author provided a justified reason for not hiring her. The candidate's meltdown and the friend's accusations seem to indicate a possible misunderstanding of the business needs.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, as long as the refusal is based on the job's essential functions and not a protected class, the author isn't in the wrong. The candidate's veganism isn't a protected category in most jurisdictions, so the author isn't discriminating illegally. The author is upholding the business's standards and menu requirements, which are critical for their operations and customer expectations.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
