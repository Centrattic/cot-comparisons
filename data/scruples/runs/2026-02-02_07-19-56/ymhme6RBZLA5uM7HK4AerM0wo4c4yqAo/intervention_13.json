There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at their parents' bar and grill/cafe, which focuses on meat-heavy dishes. They're in charge of hiring the new head chef, and a vegan candidate applied. The candidate is a recent culinary grad with no experience. She's vegan and can't taste the meat dishes, so the author decided not to hire her because she wouldn't fit into the meat-heavy environment. The candidate got upset and accused the author of being an asshole. The author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet me break it down. The business has a specific menu that's mostly meat, and the chef needs to manage a meat-heavy kitchen. The job requires the chef to taste the dishes, a critical part of quality control. The candidate is vegan and can't eat meat. The author is concerned that she can't properly perform the tasting part of the job, which is essential. \n\nFrom a business perspective, the job requires specific skills that align with the menu. If the candidate's dietary restrictions prevent her from tasting the main dishes, which are meat-based, then she might not be able to fulfill the role effectively. The author isn't discriminating based on her being vegan but is assessing her ability to perform the job duties. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a legal angle. In some places, dietary restrictions could be considered a protected class, but veganism isn't typically a protected status unless it's part of a religious belief. The author isn't saying they won't hire her because she's vegan, but because she can't perform the necessary job functions, like tasting the food. \n\nAlso, the author did consider her, gave her a chance, and then made a decision based on the requirements. The candidate's reaction (meltdown and hanging up) might indicate poor professionalism, but the author's reasoning is about job fit. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a business decision based on the job's needs. The candidate's veganism is a personal choice, and the job requires meat-based cooking. The author's actions are within their rights as long as they're not discriminating based on a protected category. Since the rejection is based on job requirements, not the candidate's personal beliefs, the author is justified. Answer B.\n"
