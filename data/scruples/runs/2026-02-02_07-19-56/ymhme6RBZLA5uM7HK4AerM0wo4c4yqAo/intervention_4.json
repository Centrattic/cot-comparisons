There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef for a meat-heavy restaurant. The author is a manager helping to hire a new head chef, and the candidate was a vegan with no experience. \n\nFirst, the restaurant's main focus is meat-based dishes with very few vegetarian options. The author's concern is that the chef needs to taste the food, which includes meat, and the candidate wouldn't do that. They cited a meltdown from the candidate and some backlash from a friend.\n\nI need to consider employment laws and ethical hiring practices. In the US, there's a principle of employment at-will, meaning employers can choose who to hire based on their business needs. Unless there's a protected class involved, which in this case there isn't\u2014veganism isn't a protected class. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut ethically, some might argue that the author dismissed the candidate without considering their potential to adapt. However, the role requires tasting meat-based dishes, which is critical for quality control. The chef needs to be able to taste the food they're preparing, and if the candidate refuses to eat meat, they can't perform that duty effectively. \n\nThe candidate didn't have prior experience, which is a valid consideration. The author also considered the restaurant's reputation and the need for the chef to fit into the existing structure. The author's decision was based on job requirements, not discrimination. \n\nThe candidate's meltdown and the friend's reactions might be emotional, but it doesn't negate the business needs. The author did explain the reason for not hiring her, which seems respectful. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They made a decision based on the job's requirements and the restaurant's operational needs.\n"
