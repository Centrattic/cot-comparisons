There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for not hiring a vegan chef when their restaurant is mostly meat-based.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's main offerings are meat-heavy dishes with only one vegetarian option. The chef position requires tasting meat dishes for quality control. The candidate is a vegan, which could be a problem since she wouldn't eat the food she's preparing. The author decided not to hire her because of this, leading to a conflict.\n\nI need to consider employment laws and discrimination. In many places, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't a protected category under employment law. So refusing someone based on being vegan isn't illegal in itself. However, the key point here is whether the candidate could perform the job duties. If the role requires tasting meat dishes, and she's a strict vegan who can't do that, then it's a legitimate concern. The author is looking for someone who can handle the responsibilities, like tasting food, which a vegan might not be able to do without adjustments. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to accommodate her, like having someone else taste the meat dishes. However, the author's reason is that during busy times, the chef can't rely on someone else. The author's mother mentions that a chef who can't taste their own food is like having a hand tied behind their back. That suggests that the ability to taste is essential for quality control.\n\nAlso, the candidate might not have the necessary experience. She's a recent culinary grad with no job experience, which is a valid consideration. However, the main issue here is the veganism affecting job performance. The author isn't discriminating on illegal grounds but is considering job requirements. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a business decision based on the necessity for the chef to taste and manage the meat-based dishes, which are central to the restaurant's identity. The candidate's dietary restrictions conflict with the essential functions of the job. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
