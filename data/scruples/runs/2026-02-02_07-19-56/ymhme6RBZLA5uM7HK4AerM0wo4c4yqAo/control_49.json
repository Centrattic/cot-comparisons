There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The business is a bar and grill/cafe that focuses on meat dishes, with only one vegetarian option. They're hiring for a head chef position. The candidate is a vegan graduate with no experience, and during the interview, she expresses her veganism and how she wouldn't eat meat. The interviewer is concerned about her ability to taste test meat dishes, which is a crucial part of the job. The candidate suggests someone else could do the tasting, but the interviewer rejects her, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are the job requirements versus the candidate's personal beliefs. The head chef must taste the food, especially the meat dishes. The candidate's refusal to eat meat could hinder her effectiveness in this role. The business's reputation and menu are built around meat, so the chef's role is integral to maintaining that. The interviewer's main concern is valid because if the chef can't taste the meat dishes, quality control is compromised. The candidate's approach to delegating tasting doesn't solve the problem since the chef's personal ability to assess the food is necessary.\n\nHowever, there's also the angle of discrimination. Veganism is a protected class in some places, so refusing to hire someone based on that could be legally problematic. But in this case, the refusal is based on the job requirements, not the candidate's beliefs. The role inherently requires tasting meat, which the candidate cannot do. So it's a matter of job fit rather than discrimination.\n\nThe candidate's meltdown and the friend's backlash might seem harsh, but the interviewer had a legitimate reason to decline. The business needs someone who can perform all duties, including tasting meat dishes. The candidate's lack of experience is another factor, but even if she had experience, her inability to taste the food is a showstopper.\n\nIn conclusion, the interviewer made a reasonable decision based on the job's essential functions. The candidate's veganism is a personal choice that conflicts with the job's requirements. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
