There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not hiring a vegan chef when their restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based. The author is a manager at a family-run bar and grill that's known for meat dishes. They were interviewing a candidate who is a strict vegan and culinary school graduate with no job experience. The candidate didn't have experience in a meat-heavy kitchen, and the author felt she wouldn't be a good fit because the chef needs to taste the meat dishes, which she can't do. The author rejected her, and the candidate was upset.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to consider is employment discrimination laws. In many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on religion, race, gender, etc., but dietary preferences like veganism aren't typically protected categories. So, unless the veganism is tied to a protected status, like a religious belief, the author might not be in the wrong for choosing a chef who can perform the job requirements.\n\nThe job requires tasting meat dishes, which is part of quality control. The candidate made it clear she's a strict vegan and couldn't taste the meat. The author is right to prioritize someone who can fulfill the job's essential functions. Even if the candidate had the culinary skills, she couldn't perform a crucial task. The author isn't obligated to hire someone who can't meet the job's requirements, regardless of their personal beliefs.\n\nAnother angle is if the author considered the candidate's qualifications. The candidate had no job experience, so that's a valid concern. The author might have been looking for someone with more practical experience, especially for a head chef position. Also, the author's friend recommended her, but the author still had the right to evaluate based on merit.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown and being called an asshole by the friend) might be emotional, but the author's reasoning is based on practical job requirements. The author isn't being discriminatory; they're assessing fit for the role. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
