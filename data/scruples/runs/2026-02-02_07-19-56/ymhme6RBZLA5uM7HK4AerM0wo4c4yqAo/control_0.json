There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when the restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's primary offerings are meat-heavy dishes. They have only one vegan option. The head chef is retiring, and the author, a manager, is handling the hiring. The candidate is a vegan culinary student with no job experience. During the interview, she mentions being vegan and her preference for vegan dishes. The author is concerned because she can't taste the meat dishes, which are central to the restaurant's identity.\n\nThe key points here are the job requirements versus the candidate's personal beliefs. The restaurant needs a chef who can manage quality control, including tasting meat dishes, which are a significant part of their menu. The candidate's refusal to taste meat would hinder her ability to perform a critical job duty. The author's decision is based on practicality and the restaurant's needs, not discrimination against her veganism. \n\nLegally, in many places, it's acceptable to require employees to perform essential job functions. The restaurant isn't discriminating based on protected characteristics like race or gender, but rather on job-related qualifications. The author's reasoning is that the chef must be able to taste and oversee the quality of meat dishes, which are central to the business. The candidate's veganism conflicts with this requirement, making her unsuitable for the role. \n\nEmotionally, the author might feel bad about the candidate's reaction, but the decision is based on operational needs. The author could have considered other roles where veganism isn't a barrier, but the specific job requires tasting meat. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing the restaurant's needs and the job's essential functions.\n"
