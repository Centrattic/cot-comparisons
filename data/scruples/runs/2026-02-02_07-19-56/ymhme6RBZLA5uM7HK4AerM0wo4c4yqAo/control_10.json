There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of the restaurant's dishes are meat-based.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant's identity is centered around meat dishes like steaks, burgers, and fish. They have very few vegan options. The person in question is handling the hiring for a head chef position because their mother is retiring. The candidate was a vegan culinary student with no prior experience but was recommended by a friend. During the interview, the candidate made it clear she's a strict vegan and couldn't taste meat dishes, which the restaurant's role requires for quality control. The author decided not to hire her and informed her that she'd be better suited elsewhere. The candidate reacted badly.\n\nNow, the key points here are the job requirements. The head chef needs to taste all dishes, including meat-based ones, which is a core part of the job. The candidate's veganism makes it impossible for her to perform this essential duty. The author is making a business decision based on the candidate not meeting a critical job requirement. There's no discrimination here because the job itself requires tasting meat; it's not about personal preference but job necessity. The author isn't rejecting someone for their dietary choices per se, but because the job's responsibilities are incompatible with those choices. \n\nHowever, maybe some could argue that the restaurant could adapt by having a non-vegan person taste the meat dishes. But the author points out that the kitchen is busy, and everyone has specific roles. It's impractical to assign someone else to taste-test for the chef. Plus, the head chef's role in quality control is vital. The candidate's refusal to taste meat would interfere with the job's core functions.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate might feel discriminated against, but in this case, it's about job requirements. If the job requires tasting meat, then the employer is justified in not hiring someone who can't do that. It's a legitimate business decision, not a personal attack. The author isn't in the wrong because they're not forcing the candidate to eat meat; they're just requiring her to fulfill the job's responsibilities. The candidate is also looking for a vegan chef job, which aligns with her preferences, so she might not be the right fit here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
