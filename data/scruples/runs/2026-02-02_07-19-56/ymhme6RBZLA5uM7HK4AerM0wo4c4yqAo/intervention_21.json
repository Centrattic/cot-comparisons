There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not hiring a vegan chef when most of their menu is meat-based.\n\nFirst, the context: The restaurant is known for meat dishes, has minimal vegan options. The author is handling the hiring for the head chef position. The candidate is vegan, has no job experience, and during the interview emphasizes her veganism and mentions she won't eat meat. The author is concerned about her ability to taste meat dishes, which she suggests having someone else do, but the author rejects the idea because the head chef must handle final tasting and quality control. They decline her application, and she reacts negatively.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author is responsible for hiring a head chef who can manage a meat-heavy menu. The candidate's refusal to taste meat dishes is a problem because the role requires tasting all food, especially the main offerings. The restaurant's reputation relies on meat dishes, so the chef needs to understand and ensure the quality of those items. The candidate's veganism makes her unwilling to taste meat, which is a critical job function. \n\nIs there discrimination here? The question is whether refusing a vegan candidate is based on a protected class. Veganism isn't a protected category in most places. The author isn't excluding her because of her religion, race, etc., but because her dietary preferences conflict with the job requirements. The job requires tasting meat dishes, which she can't do. So, it's a legitimate requirement for the position. \n\nThe candidate's argument is that she's struggling to find work as a vegan chef, but the author's business isn't set up for that. The author isn't obligated to create a vegan menu just because someone is vegan. They're hiring for a specific role that's incompatible with her dietary restrictions. \n\nThe author's decision seems based on job-related concerns rather than bias. They even considered her despite the lack of experience, but the refusal to taste meat was a dealbreaker. The candidate's meltdown and the friend's reaction might indicate they didn't expect the job requirements to be a problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're prioritizing the restaurant's needs and the job's essential functions. There's no discrimination; it's a matter of job fit. Answer B.\n"
