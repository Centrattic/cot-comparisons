There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef at a restaurant that serves mostly meat dishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The restaurant's main dishes are meat-based, with very few vegetarian options. The candidate is a vegan with no professional experience, only culinary school. During the interview, she mentioned she's a strict vegan and talked about vegan dishes. The author was concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat dishes, which the candidate wouldn't do. They decided not to hire her, leading to a backlash from her and the friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the restaurant's business model relies heavily on meat, the chef role requires tasting meat dishes, and the candidate's veganism conflicts with that requirement. The author's reasoning is that the candidate couldn't fulfill a core job duty (tasting meat) which is essential for quality control. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't protected under employment law. The job requires specific duties that the candidate is unwilling to perform due to personal beliefs. The author is prioritizing the restaurant's needs over the candidate's preferences, which is generally acceptable unless there's a protected class involved here, which there isn't in this case.\n\nThe candidate's argument is that she's struggling to find work as a vegan chef, but the author's restaurant isn't a vegan establishment. The author is under no obligation to hire someone whose values conflict with the job's requirements. The author also mentions that they considered her but concluded she wasn't a fit, which is a standard part of the hiring process.\n\nThe friend's reaction and the candidate's meltdown might be seen as overreacting, but the question is about the author's rightness. The author made a business decision based on job requirements. There's no indication of bias beyond the job's necessity. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a reasonable assessment for their business's needs.\n"
