There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when their restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's identity is heavily centered around meat dishes. They have very few vegetarian or vegan options, which is part of their reputation. The parent's bar and grill has thrived on this for a decade. The author, as a high-ranking manager and someone involved in hiring, is responsible for finding a new head chef as the current one retires.\n\nThe candidate in question is a recent culinary school graduate with no professional experience. She's a strict vegan and during the interview, when asked about working in a meat-heavy environment, she suggests that someone else can taste the dishes since she can't or won't eat meat. The author and their parents are concerned because the head chef must taste all dishes, especially given the high volume and the importance of quality control. They decide not to hire her, leading to a fallout where the candidate is upset and the friend is angry.\n\nNow, considering the scenario, the main issue is whether refusing to hire someone because of their veganism is discriminatory. But the restaurant's business model is built around meat dishes. The candidate's dietary preferences are a fundamental part of her lifestyle, but the position requires her to taste and oversee meat-based dishes. The restaurant isn't in the business of providing vegan options, so expecting the chef to handle meat-based dishes is part of the job. \n\nHowever, there's a line between job requirements and discrimination. If the position inherently requires tasting meat and the candidate cannot do that due to personal beliefs, it's a valid reason to not hire them. It's not about the candidate's personal choices but the job's essential functions. The author isn't discriminating based on protected classes like race or gender, but rather evaluating the candidate's ability to perform the job's key duties. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the restaurant could adapt by hiring someone who can manage the current menu while also bringing new ideas. But the restaurant's identity is tied to their meat-heavy offerings, and the parents have built a reputation around that. The author might have a valid reason to stick with a candidate who can taste and uphold the quality of their existing menu, especially with high volume and no room for compromise on that aspect.\n\nThe candidate's suggestion that someone else could taste the dishes doesn't address the necessity of the head chef's role in quality control and tasting. The job requires the chef to be directly involved in ensuring the dishes meet their standards. So, the author's decision is based on the candidate's inability to fulfill a critical part of the job, not on prejudice against her dietary choices.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because the job's requirements are clear and essential to the restaurant's operation. Refusing to hire someone who cannot perform a core duty (tasting meat dishes) isn't discrimination but a reasonable business decision.\n"
