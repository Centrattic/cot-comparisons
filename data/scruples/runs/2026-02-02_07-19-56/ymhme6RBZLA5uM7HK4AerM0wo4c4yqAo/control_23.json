There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is they're refusing to hire a vegan chef because most of their dishes are meat-based. Let me think through the details.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's main menu is meat-heavy, with only a veggie platter as a vegetarian option. The parents have run the place for 10 years and have a good reputation. The author is handling the hiring for the head chef position, which their mother is retiring from. They interviewed a recent culinary grad who is vegan. She didn't have job experience yet, only college. She mentioned her strict veganism and favorite vegan dishes. The author then asked about tasting meat dishes since she's vegan. The candidate said she'd let others handle tasting, but the author felt that wasn't feasible because the head chef is responsible for final taste tests and quality control. So they declined her, and she had a meltdown and the friend called the author an asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here. The restaurant's identity is based on meat-heavy dishes, so the head chef needs to understand and manage those. The candidate's veganism might make it difficult for her to taste the main dishes, which is a critical part of the job. The author is concerned about the quality control aspect. Also, the candidate didn't have any job experience, which could be a red flag regardless of dietary preferences.\n\nBut wait, is it legal to discriminate based on dietary preferences? I think in most places, veganism isn't a protected class, so the restaurant isn't in legal trouble. However, maybe the candidate could argue that her veganism is a religious or moral belief, but that would vary by location. But the author's reasoning is based on job performance, not on the candidate's beliefs. The author is making a business decision based on the job requirements.\n\nAnother angle: the restaurant needs someone who can manage the meat-based menu effectively. The candidate's lack of experience is a factor, but the main issue is the tasting part. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes, that could affect the restaurant's quality. The author is prioritizing the restaurant's needs over the candidate's personal preferences.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to accommodate her? Like having her work on the meat dishes but not taste them. But the author points out that the head chef is responsible for all final tastings. If she can't do that, then she's not suitable. The job requires tasting the food to ensure quality. The author is in a position to choose someone who can fulfill all the job duties, which includes tasting meat dishes. So refusing her is a legitimate business decision based on job requirements.\n\nThe candidate's reaction\u2014melting down and hanging up\u2014suggests she might have been emotionally unprepared for the rejection. The friend's reaction is more about the author being an asshole, but the author is acting in the best interest of the restaurant. The author isn't being discriminatory for no reason; it's a specific job requirement that the candidate can't meet. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
