There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author works at their parents' bar and grill/cafe, which is known for its meat-based dishes. They\u2019re in charge of hiring the new head chef because their mother is retiring. A vegan culinary grad applied, but the author didn't hire her because she's vegan and wouldn't eat meat. The author's concern is about taste testing the meat dishes, which is a key part of the chef's role. The applicant had a meltdown and the friend was upset, but the author feels they made the right call.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, employers can't discriminate based on religion, race, gender, etc., but dietary preferences like veganism aren't typically protected categories. So the author isn't necessarily breaking any laws here. However, ethically, some might argue that the applicant's dietary preferences shouldn't affect her suitability for the job.\n\nBut the job requires taste testing the meat dishes, which is a core part of the role. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes because of their diet, maybe the author is justified in not hiring her. The applicant did suggest someone else could taste them, but the author argues that the chef's role includes quality control, which requires personal tasting. That seems valid because the chef's personal involvement in taste is crucial for consistency and quality.\n\nAnother angle: the applicant has no job experience. Even if she's a vegan, maybe the lack of experience is a bigger issue. But the author mentions that everyone has to start somewhere, so they didn't count that as a dealbreaker. However, the main issue was the vegan aspect conflicting with the job's requirements.\n\nAlso, the restaurant's identity is meat-based. If the chef is vegan, there might be a cultural mismatch. The author's parents have built the business around meat, so they might not want a chef who's against that core. The author isn't forcing the applicant to eat meat, but the job requires tasting meat dishes, which she refuses. That's a conflict of job requirements and personal ethics.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say the author should have found a way to accommodate her, like assigning someone else for tasting. But the author argues that the chef's role includes tasting, so delegating that might not work. The author's reasoning seems practical here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author made a decision based on job requirements and business needs, not on discrimination. The applicant's dietary preference made her unsuitable for a role that requires tasting meat dishes. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
