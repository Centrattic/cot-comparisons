There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about hiring a chef for a restaurant that focuses on meat-based dishes. The candidate is a vegan, and they didn't get the job because the author felt she couldn't taste the meat dishes, which is a crucial part of the job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's needs. They have a strong meat-based menu and only one vegetarian option. The chef is responsible for tasting everything, including the meat dishes. If the candidate is a strict vegan, she wouldn't eat meat, so she can't taste those dishes herself. The author mentioned that in a busy kitchen, having the head chef taste the food is important for quality control. If the chef can't do that, maybe she can't fulfill her role effectively.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate is a recent culinary grad with no experience. The author didn't reject her solely for being vegan, but because it would be impossible for her to perform a key job duty. However, maybe there's a way around it, like having another staff member assist with tasting meat dishes. But the author points out that the kitchen is busy, and everyone has specific roles. If the chef can't taste the dishes herself, she might not catch issues that others might miss. \n\nAlso, the restaurant's reputation is built on meat-based foods. Hiring a vegan chef might not align with their current business model. The author is in a position to make hiring decisions based on the restaurant's needs. The candidate's meltdown and the friend's anger might be more about their perspective than the author's decision being wrong.\n\nBut wait, could the restaurant have adjusted? Maybe they could have hired a vegan chef and started introducing more vegan options. But the author's argument is that the restaurant isn't set up for that. If the candidate can't adapt to the existing menu, then it's a legitimate reason not to hire her. \n\nSo the key point here is whether the author's decision was based on the candidate's inability to perform a core job function. If the job requires tasting meat dishes and the candidate can't do that, then the author isn't in the wrong. They're choosing someone who can fulfill the role's requirements. The candidate's dietary preferences don't override the job's necessary duties here. Therefore, the author isn't at fault.\n"
