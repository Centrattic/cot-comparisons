There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario is about refusing to hire a vegan chef for a restaurant that primarily serves meat-based dishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, employment discrimination based on dietary preferences like veganism isn't typically protected under anti-discrimination laws unless it's tied to a protected class such as religion or a disability. So legally, the author might be in the right because refusing someone based on their veganism isn't illegal in this context.\n\nNext, the practicality of the situation. The restaurant's menu is heavily meat-based, with only one vegetarian option. The chef's role includes taste-testing, which is crucial for quality control. A vegan chef who can't or won't taste meat dishes might not perform this duty effectively. The author mentions that the chef would need to rely on others, which could be problematic during busy times. This seems like a valid operational concern.\n\nThe candidate's lack of experience is another factor. While the author isn't ruling out inexperienced candidates entirely, the candidate's veganism conflicts with the job requirements. The author's decision is based on the candidate's inability to meet a key responsibility, not just their dietary preferences.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels bad after turning down the candidate, especially since the candidate had a meltdown and friends accused the author of being unfair. However, the author's reasoning is rooted in the job's specific needs rather than personal bias.\n\nI should also consider if there's any alternative solution. Could the restaurant adapt by adding more vegan options? The author mentions that their parents have built a reputation on meat-based dishes, so a sudden shift might not align with their business model. The mother is retiring, so maintaining the restaurant's identity is important.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on legitimate job requirements and the operational needs of the restaurant. There's no indication of discrimination beyond the job's inherent requirements. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
