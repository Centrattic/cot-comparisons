There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is helping to hire a new chef for their family's restaurant, which is mostly meat-based. They interviewed a vegan chef, and during the interview, she made it clear she's a strict vegan. The author was concerned because the restaurant's main dishes are meat-heavy and the chef would need to taste the food. The vegan candidate suggested having someone else do the tasting, but the author's family thinks that's not feasible because the chef needs to taste everything. They ended up not hiring her, and the candidate got upset, with the author's friend being angry.\n\nFirst, I need to think about whether the author had a valid reason not to hire her. The restaurant's main offerings are meat-based, and the chef's role includes tasting the food. Since the candidate is a strict vegan, she wouldn't eat meat, so how could she properly taste the dishes? The author's argument is that the chef needs to taste the food to ensure quality, which makes sense. If the chef can't taste the food, maybe they can't do their job properly. \n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the restaurant could have adjusted a bit. But they have almost no vegan options, so it's a meat-focused place. The candidate might not have the necessary experience in a meat-heavy environment. However, the author might be discriminating based on dietary preferences. Wait, is veganism a protected class? Probably not in most places, so it's not illegal to not hire someone because of that. The author could argue that the job requires tasting meat dishes, which the candidate can't do, so it's a job requirement. \n\nThe candidate was a recent grad with no experience, which is a factor. The author's friend is upset, but maybe the author wasn't obligated to hire someone who isn't a good fit. The author did consider her, but in the end, the job requires certain duties that the candidate can't fulfill. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. It's about job requirements and fit. The answer should be B (No).\n"
