There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when the restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's identity is centered around meat dishes, and they have very few vegetarian or vegan options. The author is in charge of hiring the new head chef, a critical role that involves tasting and quality control. The candidate is a vegan with no prior work experience, only culinary school. She's clear about her dietary preferences upfront, which is important here.\n\nThe author's concern is valid because a head chef in a meat-heavy establishment needs to taste and oversee the meat dishes. If the chef can't or won't taste the food, especially during busy times, it could affect the restaurant's quality and operations. The candidate suggested having someone else taste, but the author correctly points out that the head chef's role includes that responsibility. Delegating that to someone else might not be feasible or effective.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate was upfront about her veganism. The author could have considered if her veganism posed a conflict with the role. However, the job requires tasting meat dishes, which she's not willing to do. The author's decision is based on the job's requirements, not discrimination. The candidate's meltdown and the friend's reaction might indicate they expected a different outcome, but the author's reasoning is job-related and practical.\n\nLegally, unless veganism is a protected class (which varies by region), refusing due to job incompatibility isn't discrimination. The author didn't lie or discriminate; they assessed the candidate's suitability for the role. The candidate's lack of experience was a factor too, but the main issue was the inability to perform a key duty\u2014tasting meat dishes. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
