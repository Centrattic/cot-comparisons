There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not hiring a vegan chef when the restaurant primarily serves meat-based dishes. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's main offerings are meat-heavy, like steaks, burgers, tacos, etc. They have very few vegan or vegetarian options\u2014just a veggie platter. The parents have run the place for 10 years and have a good reputation. The person handling the hiring is a manager, and the new chef position is for someone to replace the retiring head chef. The candidate was a vegan culinary student with no experience. \n\nThe key points here are the job requirements versus the candidate's dietary restrictions. The chef's role includes tasting the food, which is crucial for quality control. The vegan candidate couldn't eat meat, so she suggested having someone else taste it, but the manager rejected that because the kitchen is busy and the chef needs to handle it themselves.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the restaurant has a specific menu that relies heavily on meat. The chef needs to be able to taste and oversee the preparation of those dishes. If the chef is vegan and can't taste the meat dishes, that could be a problem for quality control. The manager had a right to consider the job's requirements when hiring. The candidate didn't have experience, which isn't a dealbreaker, but the core issue is the tasting requirement. \n\nThe author's decision was based on the job's needs, not discrimination against the candidate's dietary preferences. The candidate might find it hard to get a job as a vegan chef in a meat-centric area, but the restaurant isn't obligated to adapt their entire operation for a single candidate. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The manager could have considered if the candidate could adapt, maybe by learning to prepare meat dishes even if they don't eat them. But the main issue is the tasting part. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes, that's a functional problem. The author is not in the wrong here because they hired based on the job's requirements.\n"
