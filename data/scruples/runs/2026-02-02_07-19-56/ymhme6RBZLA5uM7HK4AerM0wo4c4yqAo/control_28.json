There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when the restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The restaurant is known for its meat-heavy dishes, with only a single vegetarian option. The writer is the manager handling hiring for a head chef position, which is crucial because the current chef is retiring. The candidate is a vegan culinary grad but has no job experience. During the interview, the candidate's veganism is highlighted, and when asked about tasting meat dishes, she suggests someone else could do it. The writer turns her down, feeling she wouldn't fit, and the candidate reacts strongly.\n\nNow, the key points here are about hiring practices and discrimination. The writer argues that the candidate wouldn't have been a good fit because of the restaurant's focus on meat and the chef's need to taste all dishes for quality control. The candidate, on the other hand, feels discriminated against because of her dietary preferences. \n\nIn the US, employment discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't protected under federal law unless it's tied to a protected class like religion. If the veganism is a personal choice, employers can consider it if it affects job performance. Here, the writer is concerned that the chef can't taste meat dishes, which are central to the menu. The job requires tasting all dishes, including meat, which the candidate refuses to do. If that's a core job function, then refusing to perform that task could be a legitimate reason to not hire the candidate. \n\nHowever, there's an alternative angle. Could the restaurant make reasonable accommodations? For example, could they assign someone else to taste the meat dishes if the chef can't? But the writer mentions that the kitchen is busy and everyone has specific roles. The head chef's role in quality control might depend on their own tasting. If someone else has to do it, maybe that's an issue of workflow or efficiency. The writer's mother even uses a metaphor about a chef having a hand tied behind their back if they can't taste their own food, implying that tasting is essential.\n\nAnother factor is the candidate's experience. She's a recent grad with no job experience. The writer might be concerned that even if she were willing to taste meat, her lack of experience could be a problem. But the main issue here is the veganism conflicting with job responsibilities. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the writer might not be in the wrong because the job requires tasks that the candidate can't perform due to personal beliefs. Discrimination laws typically don't cover dietary preferences unless they're part of a protected category. The writer is making a business decision based on the needs of the restaurant. However, the candidate might feel it's a matter of bias, especially if there are no other qualified candidates. But the restaurant's menu is a key part of their brand and operations, so the chef must align with that. \n\nOn the other hand, if the restaurant is in an area where finding a chef who can handle meat dishes is hard, maybe they should consider training someone. But the writer points out that the candidate's refusal to taste meat is a direct conflict with the job's core functions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer's decision seems justified. They're not violating any laws, and the role's requirements make the candidate's refusal a legitimate disqualifier. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
