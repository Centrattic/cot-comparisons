There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for refusing to hire the vegan chef. Let's start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe user works at a bar and grill/cafe that's known for meat-based dishes. They're hiring a new head chef to replace their mother, who's retiring. The applicant is a recent culinary grad with no work experience, and she's a strict vegan. She came in for an interview and talked about her vegan dishes. The user asked if she could taste the meat dishes, and she said someone else would do it. The user ended up not hiring her, saying she'd be better in a vegan kitchen. She had a meltdown, and the user's friend called them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, employment discrimination laws (like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act) prohibit discrimination based on religion, race, gender, etc. But veganism isn't a protected class. So legally, the user isn't doing anything wrong by not hiring someone because of dietary preferences. However, there might be other angles, like disability or religious practices. Since the user didn't mention any such claims, maybe that's not an issue here.\n\nNext, the practical aspects. The restaurant's identity is built around meat-heavy dishes. The head chef is responsible for tasting and quality control. If the chef refuses to taste the meat dishes, that could be a problem. Even if someone else could do it, the chef's input is crucial. The user's concern is valid because the chef needs to ensure the food meets standards, and not tasting it could compromise quality.\n\nThe applicant's situation: she's a recent grad with no experience. While everyone starts somewhere, the lack of experience might make her less suitable even if she had the right dietary flexibility. But the main issue is her veganism conflicting with the restaurant's menu. The user considered her but decided against it for valid operational reasons.\n\nThe applicant's reaction was a meltdown and hanging up, which is unprofessional, but the user isn't responsible for that. The user's friend's reaction might be more about personal feelings than the decision's validity.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the user is closing off opportunities for a vegan chef, but the restaurant's business model prioritizes meat. Hiring a vegan chef there would create a conflict, as the chef might not be able to perform key duties. So the user's decision is based on the job requirements, not just personal preference.\n\nIn summary, the user isn't in the wrong because the decision is based on the job's practical needs and the restaurant's established menu, which aligns with their requirements for the head chef role. There's no legal or ethical violation here, just a mismatch between the candidate's preferences and the job's demands.\n"
