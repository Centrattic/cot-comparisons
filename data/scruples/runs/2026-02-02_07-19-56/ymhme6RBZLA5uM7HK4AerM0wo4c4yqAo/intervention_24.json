There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when their restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based. The author is a manager at their parents' bar and grill, which has a reputation for meaty dishes. They ended up not hiring a candidate who is a vegan because he felt she wouldn't be a good fit for the meat-heavy environment.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the restaurant's menu focus versus the candidate's dietary preferences. The candidate is a vegan and has no experience in the culinary field except for college. The author was concerned because the chef needs to taste all dishes, including meat, which the vegan candidate wouldn't eat. The candidate then had a meltdown and was upset, and her friend accused the author of being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider employment laws and discrimination. In many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on religion, race, gender, etc. But dietary preferences like veganism aren't typically protected under anti-discrimination laws unless they're tied to a religious belief. If the candidate's veganism is a religious practice, then refusing to hire her could be discrimination. But if it's a personal choice, then the employer isn't in the wrong for not accommodating that when it's essential to the job.\n\nIn this case, the author's restaurant relies heavily on meat dishes. The role of a head chef requires tasting meat dishes, which is a critical part of the job. The candidate's refusal to taste meat would hinder her ability to perform this duty effectively. The author is acting in the best interest of the restaurant's operations and quality control. The candidate's lack of experience is also a factor, but the main issue is the incompatibility between her dietary restrictions and the job requirements.\n\nHowever, could there be a way to accommodate her? Maybe not. If the job inherently requires tasting meat, then it's a legitimate requirement. The author isn't discriminating based on a protected class but rather making a job-related decision based on the role's necessities. The candidate's inability to meet that requirement makes her unsuitable for the position. The author isn't obligated to hire someone who can't perform the essential functions of the job.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a deeper issue here. The author is in a position to hire, and they might have considered the candidate's lack of experience as a dealbreaker. However, the main conflict is the veganism. If the job requires tasting meat, then refusing to hire her because of her dietary choice isn't discrimination but a business necessity. The author is right to prioritize the restaurant's needs over the candidate's preferences in this context.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the job requires tasting meat, which is a fundamental part of the chef's role. The candidate's refusal to do so makes her unsuitable, even if her dietary choice is personal. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
