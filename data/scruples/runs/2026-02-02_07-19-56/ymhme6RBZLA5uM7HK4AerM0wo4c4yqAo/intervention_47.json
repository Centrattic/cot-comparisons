There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The bar and grill has a meat-heavy menu with only one vegan option. The author is the hiring manager and interviewed a vegan chef who has no experience. The chef was clear about being vegan and couldn't taste the meat dishes, which is a key responsibility. The author decided not to hire her because of this, leading to a fallout.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The job requires tasting meat dishes for quality control. If the chef can't do that due to dietary restrictions, they might not be able to properly perform the job. The author is right to consider job requirements when hiring. Employers can set job qualifications based on the role's needs. However, the chef might argue it's a discrimination issue. But veganism isn't a protected class in many places, so that might not hold. The author's main point is about the practicality of the role. The chef wouldn't be able to taste-test meat dishes, which is essential. So, the author made a business decision based on the job's demands. The other friend's anger is about the chef's situation, but the author isn't obligated to hire someone unsuitable. I think the author is justified here. Answer B.\n"
