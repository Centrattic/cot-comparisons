There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe person works at their parents' bar and grill/cafe, which has a lot of meat-based dishes and only one vegan option. They're in charge of hiring the new head chef because their mom is retiring. A friend recommended a vegan chef who's a recent culinary grad. The candidate had no job experience but had a good resume. During the interview, the candidate mentioned she's a strict vegan and talked about vegan dishes. The person was concerned because the restaurant is meat-heavy, and the chef needs to taste all the dishes. The candidate said she'd have someone else taste the meat dishes, but the person thought that wasn't feasible because of the busy environment and the chef's responsibility for quality control. They decided not to hire her, and she had a meltdown and got her friend to lash out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me consider the legal and ethical aspects. Employers can't discriminate based on religion, race, gender, etc., but dietary preferences like being vegan aren't protected under anti-discrimination laws in most places. However, the restaurant's business model relies on meat-heavy dishes. The chef's role requires tasting all dishes, including meat, which a vegan might refuse. The candidate's refusal to taste meat could hinder her ability to perform the job properly. The author might think that the candidate isn't a good fit because she can't fulfill the necessary job duties. On the other hand, the candidate might feel discriminated against for her veganism, but unless it's a protected class, the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The restaurant has a specific menu focus, and the chef should have the skills to handle those dishes. The candidate's lack of experience might also be a factor, but the author mentions that lack of experience isn't a dealbreaker. However, the main issue is the candidate's refusal to taste meat, which is essential for quality control. The author's concern is valid because the chef's role is critical in ensuring the food meets the restaurant's standards. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes, the quality might suffer, which could affect the restaurant's reputation.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown, friend's anger) might indicate that she felt unfairly judged, but the author's decision is based on job requirements. The author isn't forcing her to eat meat, just expecting her to taste it to ensure quality. The candidate's solution of having someone else taste the meat isn't practical in a busy kitchen where the head chef has specific responsibilities.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely isn't in the wrong because they're choosing a candidate who can fulfill the job's essential functions. The decision is based on the necessity for the chef to oversee all dishes, including meat, which is central to the restaurant's offerings. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
