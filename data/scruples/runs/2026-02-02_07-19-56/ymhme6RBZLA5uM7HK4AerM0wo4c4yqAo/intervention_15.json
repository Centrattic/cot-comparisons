There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef for a meat-heavy restaurant. The user themselves think the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The restaurant is known for meat-based dishes, with only a single vegetarian option. The new chef candidate is vegan and has no job experience, but just graduated from culinary school. The author decided not to hire her because she's vegan and couldn't taste test the meat dishes, which is a crucial part of the job.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's decision was discriminatory or reasonable. The key points are: the restaurant's menu is mostly meat, the chef role requires tasting all dishes, and the candidate's veganism would prevent her from doing that part of the job. The candidate had a meltdown and the friend called the author an asshole.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many countries, refusing to hire someone based on their dietary preferences (like veganism) isn't considered illegal discrimination. Discrimination laws typically cover things like race, gender, religion, and disabilities. Veganism isn't protected under most anti-discrimination laws unless it's considered a religious belief in some jurisdictions. However, the situation here isn't about refusing someone because of their veganism per se, but because their veganism conflicts with the job requirements. The job requires tasting meat dishes, which the candidate can't do. So it's about job compatibility rather than discrimination.\n\nBut there's another angle. The restaurant has a specific menu. If a vegan chef can't handle the meat-based dishes, maybe they can't perform the job effectively. The author's concern is valid because tasting is part of quality control. Alternatively, could the restaurant have adjusted the menu to include more vegan options? But the restaurant's identity is built around meat, so that might not be feasible. The parents have run the place for 10 years with a strong reputation, so changing the menu could be a risk.\n\nThe candidate doesn't have experience, which is a factor. Maybe the author is justified in looking for someone with experience in meat-based cooking. The candidate's lack of experience and the job's requirements (tasting meat dishes) are both valid reasons for not hiring her. But the author might have been too quick to dismiss her without considering if there's a compromise, like having the candidate help with other aspects even if they can't taste meat. However, if tasting is a core part of the job, that's a legitimate requirement.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if the refusal is based on an essential job function. If the job requires tasting meat, then it's not discriminatory to require that. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
