There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when their restaurant is mostly meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The restaurant's main dishes are meat-heavy, with only one vegetarian option. The author is handling the hiring for the head chef position, which is crucial because the chef has to taste and control the quality of the food. The interviewee is a vegan with no job experience, and she refuses to taste meat, which is a key part of the job here. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the chef can't taste the meat dishes, she wouldn't be effective in her role. The restaurant relies on meat, so a chef who can't or won't taste the main dishes might not be able to ensure quality. The interviewee's response about having someone else taste it doesn't work because the chef's direct involvement is necessary during busy times.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't typically protected under employment laws unless it's a religious practice or something similar. Since being vegan is a personal choice here, the author isn't legally at fault. Also, the job requires specific duties that the candidate isn't willing to perform. The author did give her a chance, considered her, and made a business decision based on the needs of the restaurant.\n\nThe friend's reaction seems overblown, but the author's stance is about job requirements. There's no indication of bias beyond the job's needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
