There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when their restaurant primarily serves meat-based dishes.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The restaurant's main dishes are meat-based, with only one vegetarian option. The head chef is retiring, and they're hiring a replacement. The candidate is a vegan with no professional experience, only culinary school. She's clear about her veganism during the interview and the manager is concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat dishes. She suggests someone else could taste them, but the manager thinks that's not feasible because of the busy environment and the importance of the chef's role in quality control. They decline her, and she gets upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the restaurant has a right to expect the chef to be comfortable with the menu, which includes meat. The candidate's veganism is a personal choice, but the job requires working with meat. The restaurant has a specific business model and customer base. They're not discriminating based on protected categories like race or gender; it's more about job requirements. The candidate might not have the necessary skills or willingness to perform a key job function (tasting meat dishes). The manager also mentions that the candidate has no job experience, which could be a factor in the decision.\n\nOn the other hand, could there be a way to accommodate her? Maybe she could work on expanding the menu to include more vegan options, but the restaurant's identity is built around meat. Also, the manager's role is to ensure the restaurant's standards are met, which might be compromised if the chef refuses to taste the main dishes. The candidate's refusal to taste meat might hinder her ability to oversee the kitchen effectively.\n\nI should also consider if there's any legal aspect. In some places, dietary preferences might be protected under religious or health reasons, but veganism is generally a lifestyle choice unless tied to a specific religious belief. However, in this case, the restaurant isn't preventing her from being vegan; they need someone who can perform the job as it's structured. So it's more a matter of job fit rather than discrimination.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown and being called an asshole) might indicate she felt slighted, but the manager is sticking to the business needs. The manager isn't rejecting her for being vegan, but because her dietary restrictions conflict with the job's requirements. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
