There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to hire a vegan chef for a meat-heavy restaurant. The user is asking whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's main dishes are meat-based, with very few vegan options. The author is the manager handling hiring. They interviewed a vegan candidate who has no job experience but just finished culinary school. The candidate made it clear she's a strict vegan and talked about her favorite vegan dishes. The author was concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat dishes, which she can't do. The candidate suggested having someone else taste the food, but the author rejected her, thinking a chef must taste their own food. The candidate got upset and the friend was angry.\n\nSo, the key points are: the restaurant's menu is mostly meat, the candidate's veganism conflicts with the job requirements, and the author didn't hire her because she couldn't taste the meat dishes. \n\nIs the author wrong here? Well, the job requires tasting meat dishes, which is a core part of the role. If the candidate can't do that, she can't perform the job properly. The restaurant's reputation is built on their meat dishes, so the chef needs to understand and ensure the quality of those. The author's reasoning seems valid because they can't have a head chef who can't taste the main offerings. \n\nBut maybe discrimination? Veganism is a personal choice, not a protected class in most places. Unless there's a law against refusing to hire someone based on dietary preferences, the author isn't breaking any laws. Also, the author isn't discriminating based on race, gender, etc., which are protected. So from a legal standpoint, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nThe candidate had no experience, which could be a factor too. The author might have been considering that as well. But even if she had experience, if she can't taste the key dishes, that's a problem. The author also mentioned that the kitchen is busy, and the chef has specific responsibilities. So the author made a business decision based on the job's requirements.\n\nThe candidate's reaction was a meltdown and the friend being angry, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong. The author felt bad but stayed firm because they thought she wouldn't fit. It seems like a legitimate business choice. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
