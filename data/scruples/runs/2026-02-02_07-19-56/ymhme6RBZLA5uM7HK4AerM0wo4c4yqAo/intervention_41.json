There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves refusing to hire a vegan chef for a meat-heavy restaurant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The restaurant's main dishes are meat-based with very few vegetarian options. The position is for a head chef who would take over from the retiring mother. The candidate is a vegan culinary student with no job experience but a strong preference for veganism. The author, as a manager, interviewed her and decided not to hire her because she wouldn't taste the meat dishes and suggested someone else do it, which the author found unacceptable.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the chef must taste all dishes for quality control, especially since they're busy. The vegan chef couldn't taste the meat dishes, so she wouldn't be a good fit. The candidate got upset and accused the author of being an asshole.\n\nNow, considering discrimination laws. In many places, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't a protected category. However, if the job requires certain tasks that conflict with the candidate's beliefs, the employer isn't obligated to accommodate that if it's a fundamental part of the job. Tasting meat dishes for quality control seems essential here. The restaurant's reputation is built on meat, so the chef's ability to taste and manage those dishes is crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate might argue that her veganism is a personal choice, but the job requires her to taste meat. If the job duties are incompatible with her ethical stance, she might not be a good fit. The author isn't forcing her to cook meat; she's just required to taste-test dishes, which she can't do. The author's decision is based on the job requirements, not on her veganism per se, but on her inability to perform a necessary duty.\n\nThe candidate's reaction\u2014meltdown and hanging up\u2014might indicate she didn't handle rejection well. The author's friends also got upset, but the main issue is the hiring decision. The author's parents run a meat-focused business, so they have the right to hire someone who can fulfill the role's essential functions. The author isn't discriminating based on protected traits; they're assessing job suitability. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
