There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when their restaurant is mostly meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The restaurant is known for meat dishes, only a few vegetarian options. The position is for a head chef. The candidate is vegan, has no job experience, and during the interview emphasized her veganism. The author (the manager) was concerned about her tasting meat dishes and how she'd handle quality control. They declined the candidate, explaining it wasn't a good fit. The candidate got upset and the friend accused the author of being an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The restaurant's menu is meat-heavy, so the head chef would need to manage and taste those dishes. The candidate being vegan might make it difficult to taste test meat dishes, which is a crucial part of the job. The author mentions that the chef is responsible for final tasting and quality control, which requires tasting the food. If the candidate refused to taste meat, that would be a problem because they can't perform a key duty. Also, the author's parents have been running the place for 10 years and have a reputation, so maintaining the menu's consistency is important.\n\nThe candidate might argue that she could adapt or work within the system, but if her veganism is strict, she might not be able to taste the meat dishes. The author considered her lack of experience as a possible dealbreaker but wasn't against it initially. However, the main issue here is the inability to perform a critical job function\u2014tasting meat. \n\nEmployers can choose candidates based on their ability to perform the job. If the role requires tasting meat, and the candidate cannot do that, it's a valid reason to not hire them. The author didn't discriminate based on religion or any protected class. The candidate's dietary preferences are personal, but in this context, they affect job performance. The author's decision seems to be based on the candidate's inability to meet job requirements, not on bias. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
