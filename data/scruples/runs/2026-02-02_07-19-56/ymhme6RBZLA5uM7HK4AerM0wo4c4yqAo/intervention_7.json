There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for not hiring a vegan chef when their restaurant is mostly meat-based.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The restaurant's main dishes are meat-based, with very few vegan options. The author is in charge of hiring and interviewed a vegan chef who has no work experience but culinary school. The chef was upfront about being vegan and mentioned she couldn't taste meat dishes because of her diet. The author decided not to hire her because of this, and she had a bad reaction.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't a protected category under anti-discrimination laws. So legally, the author's decision might be allowed. However, ethically, there could be arguments both ways. \n\nThe author might argue that the chef's refusal to taste meat would hinder her ability to perform a key duty of the job, which is quality control. If the head chef can't taste the meat dishes, that could affect the restaurant's standards. On the other hand, the chef might argue that the restaurant's meat-heavy menu doesn't suit her vegan values, and the author is not accommodating her dietary needs, which could be seen as a lack of diversity in hiring.\n\nBut here's the thing: the restaurant's identity is built on meat-based food. The chef candidate's veganism might not align with the job's requirements. Even if she could adapt, the tasting issue is a practical problem. The author's concern about her ability to perform the job's essential functions is valid. The author isn't discriminating based on a protected class; they're making a business decision based on job suitability.\n\nThe friend's reaction and the vegan chef's meltdown might be emotional but don't necessarily make the author wrong. The author acted in what they believed was best for the restaurant's operations. Also, the candidate didn't propose any solutions to the tasting problem, which is a critical part of the role.\n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is sensitive, the author's decision seems justified based on the job's requirements and the restaurant's nature. They aren't in the wrong here.\n"
