There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to hire a vegan chef for a restaurant that's primarily meat-based.\n\nSo, the key points here: the restaurant's menu is mostly meat, with very few vegetarian options. The author is in charge of hiring, and the candidate is a vegan with no job experience but a culinary degree. The author ends up not hiring her because she's vegan and can't taste the meat dishes, which is a crucial part of the role as the head chef.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, employers can't discriminate based on dietary preferences unless it's protected under anti-discrimination laws. However, dietary choices like veganism aren't typically protected under employment laws unless they're tied to a religious belief or disability, which isn't mentioned here. So legally, the author might be in the clear.\n\nNext, the practical aspect. The job requires tasting meat dishes, which is essential for quality control. If the chef can't or won't taste the food, that's a legitimate concern. The author explains that the head chef must taste everything, and delegating that task isn't feasible during busy times. That's a valid job requirement, so refusing someone who can't perform that duty isn't necessarily discriminatory.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the author is closing off opportunities for a vegan chef, but others might say it's about job fit. The restaurant's identity is meat-based, so a chef who can't engage with that aspect might not be suitable. The author did consider the candidate's resume and gave her a chance, then made a decision based on the role's needs.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown and hanging up) might reflect poorly on her, but that doesn't absolve the author if there was a bias. However, the author's decision was based on job requirements, not prejudice. There's also the point that the author's friend recommended her, but the author still interviewed her, showing they tried to be fair.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's refusal is based on the job's necessity to taste meat dishes, which is a legitimate requirement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
