There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of the dishes are meat-based. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the job is at a bar and grill/cafe that's known for meat-heavy dishes. The parent's place has a good reputation in the neighborhood, and they have very few vegan options. The author is handling the hiring for a head chef position as their mother is retiring. They interviewed a candidate who is a strict vegan, with no job experience but culinary school. The author was concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat-based dishes, and the candidate suggested someone else could do the tasting. The author decided not to hire her, leading to a backlash from the candidate and the friend.\n\nNow, the key points here are the job requirements. The head chef is responsible for tasting and quality control, which is crucial for a meat-heavy menu. The candidate's veganism might conflict with the necessity to taste meat dishes to ensure quality. The author's reasoning is that the chef must be able to taste their own food, which a vegan wouldn't do. \n\nIs there a legal issue here? In many places, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't protected under employment law unless it's tied to a protected class like religion. Veganism isn't a protected status in most regions. So legally, the author might be in the right. \n\nEthically, it's a bit more murky. Could the candidate have adapted? Maybe the restaurant could have adjusted by having a non-vegan staff member taste the meat dishes under the chef's supervision. However, the author argues that during busy times, the chef's involvement is necessary, and delegating tasting to someone else isn't feasible. The restaurant's reputation and menu depend on the head chef's ability to oversee all aspects of food preparation and quality, which includes tasting meat dishes. \n\nThe candidate didn't have any experience, which is a factor. The author mentions that while lack of experience isn't a dealbreaker, the candidate's inability to perform a key job function (tasting meat) is. The author's decision was based on the job requirements, not the candidate's personal beliefs, but rather the practical need for the role.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown and being called an asshole) might be seen as their own issue, but the author's stance remains on the job's necessity. The friend's criticism about finding work as a vegan chef might be a valid point, but the restaurant's specific needs take precedence here.\n\nSo, putting it together, the author made a decision based on the job's requirements, which are critical for the restaurant's operation. There's no evidence of discrimination beyond the job's necessary functions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
