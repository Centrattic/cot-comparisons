There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef for a meat-heavy restaurant. The question is whether the author (AITA) made the right decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based, with only a couple of vegetarian options. The candidate is a strict vegan, which could be a problem because the head chef's role requires tasting meat dishes. The chef mentioned that they can't taste the meat dishes, so the restaurant would need someone else to do that, which isn't feasible during busy times. The author decided not to hire her because she wouldn't be able to perform a critical job function\u2014tasting the food. \n\nFrom a business perspective, the restaurant needs a chef who can ensure the quality of their meat dishes. If the chef can't taste the meat, they can't properly oversee the cooking process. That seems like a valid reason not to hire someone. Also, the candidate didn't have any job experience, which might be a red flag for some positions. The author is a manager and made a judgment call based on the job's requirements.\n\nOn the other hand, the candidate was rejected solely because of dietary preferences. But in this case, it's not just about preferences; it's about job functionality. The position requires tasting meat dishes, and the candidate can't do that due to her strict veganism. So it's a matter of the job's essential functions versus the candidate's ability to perform them. \n\nDiscrimination laws usually protect against hiring biases based on race, gender, religion, etc., but dietary preferences aren't typically protected in the same way. Unless the candidate could have made a reasonable accommodation (like having someone else taste the food), which the restaurant found impractical, it's not illegal to not hire her. The author's reasoning seems to be based on the inability to perform a key job duty, not on a protected characteristic.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown and being called an asshole) might be an emotional response, but the author's decision is based on business needs. The friend who recommended her might not understand the operational challenges of the restaurant. The author is in a position of responsibility to ensure the restaurant continues to operate well after the mother retires. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The decision is based on the necessary skills for the job. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
