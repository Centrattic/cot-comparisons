There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The restaurant is known for meat dishes, with only one vegetarian option. The author is handling the hiring for the head chef position. The candidate is a vegan with no job experience, but she's a recent culinary grad. During the interview, she mentions being vegan and prefers vegan dishes. The author is concerned because the chef has to taste all the meat-based dishes, and the candidate can't or won't do that. The author decides not to hire her, leading to some backlash from the candidate and the friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the restaurant's menu is primarily meat, the chef role requires tasting meat dishes, the candidate is vegan and unwilling to taste meat, leading to the decision not to hire her. The question is whether this decision is wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, employers can hire based on job requirements. If the job requires tasting meat, then it's reasonable to require the candidate to do that. Veganism is a personal choice, but if it conflicts with job duties, the employer isn't obligated to accommodate that. However, there might be exceptions if it's a protected class or if there's reasonable accommodation. But veganism isn't typically a protected class in employment laws. \n\nAlso, the candidate had no experience, which might be a factor. The author considered her resume but found the lack of experience wasn't a dealbreaker, but the vegan issue was a dealbreaker. The author also mentions that the chef needs to do quality control, which the candidate wouldn't do if she can't taste meat. So, the decision seems based on job requirements.\n\nHowever, maybe the restaurant could have adjusted. But given the menu is mostly meat, it's hard to see how the chef could avoid tasting meat. The author also said the candidate was uncooperative in finding a solution. If the candidate couldn't adapt to the job's needs, the author is justified in rejecting her. \n\nThe candidate's meltdown and the friend's reaction might be emotional, but the author's decision is based on practicality. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They made a business decision based on the job's requirements and the candidate's inability to meet them.\n"
