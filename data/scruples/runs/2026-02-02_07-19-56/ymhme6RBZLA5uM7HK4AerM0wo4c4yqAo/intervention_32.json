There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when the restaurant is mostly meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The restaurant's main dishes are meat-based, with almost no vegan or vegetarian options. The author is a manager, and their mom, the head chef, is retiring. They interviewed a vegan culinary student who had no job experience. The applicant mentioned being a strict vegan and discussed her favorite vegan dishes during the interview. The author was concerned she wouldn't be able to taste the meat dishes, and the applicant suggested having someone else do it, which the author rejected. They ended the interview and told her she's better suited elsewhere. The applicant had a meltdown, and the author feels bad but stands by their decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. From the restaurant's perspective, they need a chef who can manage a meat-heavy menu and ensure quality control by tasting the food. A vegan chef might not be able to taste meat dishes, which could be a problem. Also, the restaurant's reputation is built on meat, so maybe the chef's dietary preferences could conflict with the kitchen's needs.\n\nHowever, the applicant is a recent grad with no experience. The author's main reason for rejection seems to be her veganism, not her qualifications. But the restaurant's operational needs are valid. They need someone who can handle meat dishes and taste them. The applicant's solution of having someone else taste the food isn't feasible because the head chef is responsible for that. So maybe the author is justified in their decision because the job requires tasting meat dishes, and the applicant's strict veganism would prevent her from doing that essential task.\n\nOn the other hand, is the author discriminating based on dietary preferences? That's a tricky point. If the job requires tasting meat, then the author is looking for someone who can perform that duty. It's a legitimate job requirement. The applicant's stance as a vegan makes her unable to fulfill a key responsibility. So the author isn't in the wrong for not hiring her because she can't meet the job's requirements. The author still feels bad but remains firm, which is reasonable if the job's needs are prioritized.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the job requires tasting meat dishes, and the applicant's strict veganism makes her unable to perform that essential function. The restaurant's needs take precedence here.\n"
