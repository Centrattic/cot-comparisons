There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to hire a vegan chef for a restaurant that's primarily meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The restaurant's main dishes are meat-based, with very few vegan options. The author is handling the hiring for a new head chef after their mother retires. A candidate, who is a vegan culinary grad, applied. She didn't have work experience but was recommended by a friend. During the interview, the candidate emphasized her veganism and her favorite dishes. The author was concerned because the chef needs to taste the meat-based dishes for quality control. The candidate suggested relying on others for tasting, but the author found that unacceptable, leading to rejection. The candidate had a meltdown and the friend accused the author of being an asshole.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, not hiring someone based on their dietary preferences could be seen as discriminatory. On the other hand, the restaurant's business model relies heavily on meat, so the chef needs to be able to taste and manage those dishes, which is a legitimate job requirement. \n\nDiscrimination laws vary, but in the U.S., Title VII allows for job requirements that are necessary for the job. If the ability to taste meat is essential, then it's a valid reason. However, if the candidate could have adapted or if the restaurant could have made accommodations (like having a separate tasting area), that might change things. But in this case, the author's concern is that the chef must taste the food themselves, which the candidate refused. That's a core function of the role. \n\nAlso, the candidate didn't have work experience, which is a factor in hiring. The author might have valid reasons beyond just their dietary preference. But the issue is whether refusing based on veganism is discrimination. Veganism is a personal choice, not a protected class in most places, so the author isn't necessarily violating any laws. However, the emotional response from the candidate and the friend's reaction might make the author feel bad, but the decision could be justified by the job's requirements. \n\nSo, considering the business's needs and the essential functions of the chef role, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
