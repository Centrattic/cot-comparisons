There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if they should be considered the asshole (AITA) for refusing to hire a vegan chef when their restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a manager in their parent's bar and grill that's known for meat dishes. They're hiring a new head chef because their mother is retiring. A vegan candidate came in for an interview, and when asked about tasting meat dishes, she said someone else could do it. The author didn't hire her, and now the candidate is upset, with the author's friend calling them an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's menu focus and the chef's role. The job requires tasting meat-based dishes, which is part of quality control. The vegan chef wouldn't be able to do that. The author's concern is valid because the chef's dietary restrictions might interfere with their ability to perform a critical job duty. \n\nBut is that a valid reason to not hire her? Maybe. The author is justified in looking for someone who can fulfill all job requirements, including tasting the dishes. The candidate didn't have experience, but even without that, the inability to taste the food could be a deal-breaker. \n\nOn the other hand, could the restaurant have adjusted? Maybe they could have found a way to have vegan staff taste the non-vegan items, but the author mentioned that during busy times, everyone has specific roles. The head chef is responsible, so relying on someone else might not be feasible. \n\nAlso, the candidate was upfront about being vegan. The author gave her a fair interview and made a decision based on fit. The candidate's reaction (meltdown) and the friend's reaction might indicate that they felt discriminated against. But is that discrimination? If the job requires tasting meat, then it's a legitimate requirement. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're hiring someone who can perform the job as required. The restaurant's business model is meat-heavy, so the chef needs to be able to taste and manage those dishes. The candidate's veganism made her unsuitable for the role, and the author made a reasonable decision. Therefore, B (the author is not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
