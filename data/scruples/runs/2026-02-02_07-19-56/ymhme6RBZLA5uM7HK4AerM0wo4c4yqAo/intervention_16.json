There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when their restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based. The situation is that the author is helping their parent's bar and grill/cafe, which has a reputation for meat dishes. They need a new head chef and interviewed a vegan culinary grad. The interviewee mentioned being vegan, and when asked about tasting meat dishes, she said she'd have someone else do it. The author refused to hire her, and she had a meltdown.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if there's any discrimination here. The restaurant is meat-focused, so hiring someone who doesn't eat meat might be a problem. The key points are the job requirements. The head chef must taste the meat dishes, which the candidate refused to do. If the job requires tasting meat, then the author isn't discriminating based on veganism but rather fulfilling a necessary job function. However, if there's a way to accommodate her veganism without compromising the job's essential functions, then maybe the author is being discriminatory.\n\nThe candidate is vegan and can't taste meat, which is a core part of the job. The author's argument is that the chef needs to taste everything for quality control, which is crucial. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes, that's a problem. The restaurant's business model relies on meat items, so they need someone who can assess those. The candidate might not be a good fit here, even if she's qualified in other areas.\n\nBut wait, could there be an alternative? Like having a sous chef taste the meat dishes on her behalf? However, the author mentions that the kitchen is busy and everyone has specific roles. The head chef is responsible for final tasting. So relying on someone else might not be feasible. The job's essential functions require the chef to taste the food they're responsible for. Therefore, the author is justified in not hiring someone who can't perform that duty.\n\nAlso, considering the friend's reaction and the candidate's meltdown, maybe the author handled the rejection poorly, but the decision itself might be based on legitimate job requirements. The author isn't discriminating based on veganism but on the inability to perform a key job function. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
