There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. The scenario involves a family-run bar and grill that's known for meat dishes, and they're looking to replace the retiring head chef. The candidate is a vegan culinary student with no job experience, and the author (manager) turned her down because she can't taste meat dishes, which is a key part of the job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. In the U.S., employment discrimination laws generally protect against bias based on race, gender, religion, etc. But dietary preferences like veganism aren't a protected class, so legally, the author isn't breaking any laws by refusing to hire her. Legally, it's a no.\n\nBut ethically, there's more to unpack. The candidate was upfront about being vegan, and the job requires tasting meat dishes. The author's main concern is about the chef's ability to perform the job, specifically in terms of quality control. The chef needs to taste all dishes to ensure they meet the standard, especially for a place that's meat-centric. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes, that's a legitimate problem. The candidate suggested having someone else taste, but the author rightly points out that in a busy kitchen, that's not feasible. The head chef can't rely on others for final checks; they need to do it themselves.\n\nThe candidate had no job experience, which might have been a red flag, but the author isn't wrong for considering that. However, the main issue is the inability to perform a critical job function. The author is responsible for food quality, so refusing someone who can't taste the main menu items makes sense. The meltdown and the friend's reaction might reflect on their professionalism, but the author isn't obligated to hire someone who can't do the job.\n\nOn the flip side, could the author have been more accommodating? Maybe by considering if the candidate could adapt or if there were other roles where her vegan expertise could be useful. But the job specifically requires tasting meat dishes, and the candidate's veganism makes that impossible. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the job's requirements over the candidate's personal preferences.\n\nIn summary, the author made a reasonable decision based on the job's needs. The candidate didn't meet a key requirement, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
