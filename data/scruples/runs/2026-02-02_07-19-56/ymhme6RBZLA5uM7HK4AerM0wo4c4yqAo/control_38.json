There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, so the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not hiring a vegan chef when the restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the restaurant's main dishes are all meat-centric. They have one vegetarian option, which is a veggie platter. The author is in charge of hiring the new head chef because their mother is retiring. They interviewed a candidate who is a strict vegan and has no work experience. The author was concerned because the chef would need to taste the meat-based dishes, but the candidate suggested having someone else do it. The author felt that wouldn't work since the chef is responsible for quality control and tasting. They ultimately rejected the candidate, and the candidate had a meltdown.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the restaurant's nature, the role requirements, and the candidate's suitability. The head chef's role includes tasting and quality control of all dishes, which are mostly meat-based. The candidate is vegan and refuses to eat meat, which is a conflict with the job's essential functions. The author's reasoning is that the chef can't perform the job effectively if they can't taste the meat dishes. That seems like a legitimate job requirement. \n\nOn the other hand, the candidate might argue that their veganism is a personal choice and that they could still manage the kitchen even without tasting the meat. However, the author's position is that the chef must be able to taste the food to ensure quality, which is a valid operational necessity. The author isn't discriminating based on religion or a protected category unless veganism is considered a protected class, which it isn't in most places. The decision is based on the job's requirements, not the candidate's personal beliefs. \n\nAlso, the candidate's lack of experience might be a factor, but the author's main concern was the tasting requirement. They gave the candidate a chance, but the job's demands don't align with the candidate's dietary restrictions. The author isn't obligated to find a way around this conflict unless it's a legal requirement. Since the restaurant's business model is meat-based, it's reasonable to expect the head chef to be comfortable with meat dishes. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong because the job's essential functions require tasting meat dishes, which the candidate couldn't do due to their veganism. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
