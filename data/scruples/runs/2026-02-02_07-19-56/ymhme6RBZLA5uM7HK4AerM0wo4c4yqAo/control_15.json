There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not hiring a vegan chef when most of the dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person works in a family restaurant where most of the food is meat-based, and they have only one vegetarian option. They're hiring a new head chef because their mother is retiring. A potential candidate interviews, but she's a strict vegan. The interviewer is concerned because she can't taste the meat dishes, which are a big part of the menu. The chef candidate suggests having someone else do the tasting, but the interviewer rejects her because the head chef needs to taste everything. The candidate gets upset and the friend is upset too.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether refusing to hire someone based on their dietary preferences is discriminatory or not. The restaurant's primary cuisine is meat-heavy, so they need a chef who can handle those dishes. The candidate's veganism might conflict with the job requirements here. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many places, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't covered under protected classes, so it's not illegal. However, there's an ethical angle. The candidate has a personal belief that aligns with veganism, so is that a valid reason to not hire her? The restaurant has a specific need that might not align with her personal choices. \n\nThe candidate also lacks experience, but the user says that's not a dealbreaker. The key point is the tasting requirement. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes, that's a problem for quality control. The restaurant's reputation relies on their meat dishes, so having a chef who can't taste them might compromise that. \n\nThe user might be in the right because the job requires tasting the food they're responsible for, which includes meat. The candidate's refusal to do that makes her unfit for the role. However, the user could have considered if there's a way to accommodate the candidate, but given the job's nature, it's not feasible. \n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue that the restaurant could adapt by adding more vegan options, but the user's parents have built a meat-heavy menu and there's only one vegetarian option. There's no indication they want to change that. \n\nSo, the user's decision is based on the job requirements, not the candidate's personal beliefs. They're choosing someone who can meet the specific needs of the kitchen. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
