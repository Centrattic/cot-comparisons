There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The restaurant's main offerings are meat-based, with only one vegetarian option. The candidate is a strict vegan with no prior experience, and she couldn't taste the meat dishes. The author thought she wouldn't be a good fit because of the role's requirements.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the restaurant's identity is built around meat dishes. The head chef needs to oversee all aspects, including tasting and quality control. If the chef can't taste the meat dishes, maybe that affects the restaurant's standards. The author might have valid concerns about the candidate's ability to perform the job effectively.\n\nBut there's also a consideration of discrimination. Veganism is a personal choice, and as long as the candidate can perform the essential duties, the restaurant can't refuse based on that. However, in this case, the chef needs to taste the food, which the candidate can't do. That might be a legitimate job requirement, making the refusal acceptable.\n\nThe candidate's meltdown and the friend's reaction might indicate that the situation was handled poorly. Ending the interview abruptly and then calling her afterward could come off as abrupt. Maybe a more detailed explanation would have been better to avoid hurt feelings.\n\nSo, balancing the business needs against discrimination laws. If the role requires tasting meat, which is a fundamental part of the job, then the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason based on job performance. But if the requirement is not absolute (like having someone else taste for them), then maybe there's an issue. However, the author mentions that during busy times, everyone has specific tasks, so delegation might not be feasible. \n\nI think the author made a business decision based on job requirements and fit. They didn't hire her not because of her veganism, but because she couldn't fulfill a core duty (tasting meat dishes). Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
