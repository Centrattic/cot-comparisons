There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when most of their dishes are meat-based. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The cafe is known for meat-heavy dishes, like steak, burgers, tacos, etc. They have almost no vegan or vegetarian options. The current head chef is retiring, and the writer is helping with hiring. A vegan culinary grad applies, but since the place is all about meat, the writer and their parents are concerned. The chef candidate says she's vegan and can't taste meat dishes, so the writer turns her down. The candidate gets upset, and friends call the writer an asshole. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong.\n\nSo the main points here are: the business's nature (meat-focused), the candidate's dietary preferences conflicting with the job requirements, and the decision to not hire her based on that. \n\nFrom a business standpoint, the restaurant's identity is built around meat dishes. The head chef would need to taste and control the quality of those dishes. If the candidate refuses to taste them, that's a problem. The restaurant's success depends on the chef being able to manage and taste all the key dishes. The candidate didn't have experience in this kind of kitchen, which is a red flag. Also, the fact that she had a meltdown and hung up might indicate poor handling of rejection, but that's more about her reaction than the hiring decision.\n\nLegally, in the US, refusing to hire someone based on dietary preferences might be a gray area. Unless veganism is a protected class (which it's not in most cases), it's not illegal to not hire someone because their preferences don't align with the job requirements. The job requires tasting meat dishes, which the candidate can't do. That's a legitimate reason. \n\nEthically, some might argue that the restaurant should be more inclusive or adapt to changing trends, but the restaurant has been successful as a meat-focused place for 10 years. They don't have to change their menu to accommodate every dietary preference. The chef needs to fit the existing setup. \n\nThe candidate also didn't have any job experience, which is a valid consideration. The writer mentions that they considered this but it's not a dealbreaker. However, the tasting issue is a dealbreaker because it's essential for the role. \n\nThe candidate's reaction is unprofessional, but that's her fault. The writer's decision was based on the job's requirements, not discrimination. \n\nSo putting it all together, the writer isn't in the wrong. They made a business decision based on the needs of the restaurant and the job's essential functions. The answer should be B.\n"
