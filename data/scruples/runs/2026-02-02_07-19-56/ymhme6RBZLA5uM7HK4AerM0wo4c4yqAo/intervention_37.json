There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not hiring a vegan chef when their place is mostly meat-based. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's parent's business is a grill/cafe with a lot of meat dishes. They're hiring a head chef, and the candidate is a vegan with no experience. The author is a manager and decides not to hire her because she can't taste the meat dishes. The candidate got upset, and the author's friend is upset too. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The business has a specific menu focus, and the head chef needs to oversee the entire menu, including tasting and quality control. The vegan chef couldn't taste the meat dishes, which is essential for the role. The author's reasoning is that the chef's role requires tasting all dishes, especially meat-based ones, which are the core of the menu. The candidate's veganism would make it impossible for her to perform this critical duty effectively. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, the job requirements are clear. If the role requires tasting meat dishes and the candidate refuses due to dietary restrictions, that's a valid reason to not hire them. It's about the job's essential functions. The author isn't discriminating based on protected characteristics like race or gender but rather based on the ability to perform the job. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have been more accommodating. For example, if the chef could manage the menu and delegate some tasks to others for tasting, but the author's main point is that the head chef must personally taste everything, which is a standard practice. Also, the candidate has no experience, which is a separate issue. \n\nThe author's friend is upset, but the author isn't obligated to hire someone who can't meet the job's requirements. The user thinks the author is wrong, but based on the job's needs, the author's decision seems justified. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
