There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for not hiring a vegan chef for a meat-heavy restaurant. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The restaurant's main dishes are meat-based, with very few vegetarian options. The author is in charge of hiring because the mother is retiring. The candidate is a vegan recent culinary grad. She couldn't taste the meat dishes as a vegan, which is a key responsibility of the head chef. The author rejected her, explaining that her veganism made her a poor fit, and she had a meltdown.\n\nLegal perspective: Discrimination laws typically protect against biases like race, gender, religion, etc., but dietary preferences aren't usually covered. So, unless there's a law requiring accommodations for veganism in hiring, it's not illegal to not hire someone based on that.\n\nEthically, is it unfair? Well, the job requires tasting meat dishes, which she can't do. The author needs someone who can manage the kitchen's specific needs. The candidate might have the skills, but her dietary restrictions conflict with the job's requirements. The author is choosing based on job suitability, not just preference. The friend's anger might be about perceived discrimination, but the author's reasoning is job-related.\n\nAnother angle: Could the restaurant adjust? Maybe not easily. They're a local spot with a reputation for meat. Changing that would require significant menu changes and possibly alienate their customer base. The author isn't obligated to overhaul the business for a candidate's preferences.\n\nThe candidate's situation: She's struggling to find work in the area as a vegan chef, but the author's business isn't set up to accommodate that. The author isn't required to adjust the job to fit her, especially when the job's core duties involve meat. The author did offer a fair interview and explained the decision, which seems respectful.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author made a business decision based on job requirements and the restaurant's needs. There's no legal discrimination, and the ethical stance is that the job's demands make her unsuitable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
