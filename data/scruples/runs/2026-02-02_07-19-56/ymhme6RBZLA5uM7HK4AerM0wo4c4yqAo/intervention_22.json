There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef when the restaurant's menu is mostly meat-based.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't a protected category under employment law. So, the author might not be breaking any laws by not hiring someone because of their veganism. However, it's also important to check if there are any exceptions or specific laws that apply here.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The restaurant has a specific menu focus, and the head chef needs to be able to taste and oversee meat-based dishes. The candidate refused to taste meat, which is a core part of the job. The author's concern is valid because the chef's role requires tasting all dishes to ensure quality. If the candidate can't perform that duty, it's a legitimate reason to decline the position.\n\nThe candidate's reaction (meltdown and hanging up) might indicate that she wasn't a good fit culturally, but that's not the main issue here. The key point is whether the author had a valid reason for not hiring her. The author considered her lack of experience and the inability to taste meat as reasons. The lack of experience could be a standard hiring concern, but the veganism issue directly affects job performance.\n\nSome might argue that the restaurant should accommodate by allowing the chef to work on specific dishes or adjust the menu. However, the restaurant's identity and reputation are built around meat-based dishes. Changing that significantly could affect their business model and customer expectations. The author isn't obligated to alter the menu to fit a new chef's dietary preferences.\n\nAnother consideration is the interview process. The author did give the candidate a chance and discussed the role's requirements. The candidate was aware of the meat-heavy environment and still applied. If she wasn't willing to taste meat, she should have realized it's a mismatch. The author's decision to prioritize job requirements over personal preferences seems reasonable.\n\nIn summary, while the author might feel bad for the candidate's reaction, the decision not to hire her based on her inability to perform a critical job function (tasting meat dishes) is justified. There's no legal or ethical obligation to hire someone whose dietary restrictions conflict with the job's essential duties.\n"
