There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to hire a vegan chef for a meat-based restaurant. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The restaurant's main offerings are meat-based, with very few vegan options. The author is in charge of hiring and declined a candidate who's a strict vegan. The candidate couldn't taste the meat dishes, which is a critical part of the chef's role. The author's parents run the place, and the head chef position is key for quality control.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the vegan chef wouldn't be a good fit because she can't taste the meat dishes, which are central to the restaurant's menu. The chef's role requires tasting everything to ensure quality. The candidate's refusal to eat meat makes it impossible for her to fulfill that part of the job. \n\nThe candidate had no prior job experience, which might be a factor, but the author's main concern is the inability to taste meat dishes. The author also mentions that the kitchen is busy and roles are specific, so relying on someone else for tasting isn't feasible. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, discrimination based on dietary preferences isn't protected under most employment laws. The author isn't discriminating based on race, gender, etc., but rather making a business decision based on the job requirements. The job requires tasting meat, so the candidate's veganism made her unsuitable for the role. \n\nThe author did give the candidate a fair interview and considered her application. The decision was based on the inability to perform a key duty of the job. While the candidate was upset, the author's stance that she wouldn't fit in a meat-heavy environment seems justified. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following business needs and the job's essential functions. The answer should be B.\n"
