It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when people behind them asked them to sit down. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The concert is Elton John, which is a music event where people might stand during songs. The author and their group were in the back rows, which are on risers. When the concert started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. But the people behind them, an older couple and others, wanted them to sit so they could see the stage. The author complied once during a slower song but then stood again during other songs, leading to conflict.\n\nSo the main issue is visibility. The people behind were likely blocked from seeing the stage because the author and others stood. The author argues that everyone else stands, so why not them. But the problem is that their standing was causing a problem for others. In concerts, especially seated sections, it's usually expected that you stay seated unless there's a standing area. Even if others are standing, if your standing blocks people behind, it's considerate to sit. \n\nThe author mentions they sat down once when they could, but then chose to stand again. The older couple got frustrated and sarcastically clapped. The author responded with a dirty look. That's not a great resolution. The key point is that even if it's a concert where people move around, respecting others' view is important. The author was in a seated section, so they should have been aware that standing might affect those behind them. \n\nAlso, the fact that others in front were standing might not be a valid reason if the author's group was in a seated area. It's possible that the venue's setup allows for standing in the front but not in the back. The author's actions were causing discomfort to others, so even if they felt it was part of the concert experience, they should have considered others' needs. \n\nThe young couple who apologized felt pressured by the older ones, which shows the social pressure the author's actions created. The author's refusal to sit down despite repeated requests shows a lack of consideration. While it's understandable to want to enjoy the music, blocking others' view is inconsiderate. \n\nSo, in conclusion, even though the author might have felt it was their right to stand, the impact on others makes them at fault. The correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
