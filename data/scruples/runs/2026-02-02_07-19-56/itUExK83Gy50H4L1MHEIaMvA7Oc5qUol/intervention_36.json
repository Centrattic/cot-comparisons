It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The author wrote about an Elton John concert where they were in the back rows. They joined others in front standing up during songs, but the people behind, an older couple, asked them to sit. The author tried to comply once but then refused later, leading to tension and sarcastic clapping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Generally, in seated concerts, people are expected to stay in their seats unless the venue allows standing. However, some concerts might encourage movement, especially with energetic music. The venue here had chairs on risers, so maybe it's a seated event.\n\nThe author was in the back, so standing up might block the view for those behind. The people behind (older couple) likely wanted to see the stage without being obstructed. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate because they ignored requests that were for the comfort and view of others. \n\nHowever, the author argues that everyone in front was standing, so they felt it was okay. But their position in the back makes it so their standing affects others. The concert might have a mix of seating arrangements, but if the venue provided chairs, they should respect that seating is meant for those in the back. \n\nAlso, when the author refused to sit even after being asked, and then gave a dirty look, that escalates the situation. The older couple's frustration is understandable. While the author wanted to enjoy the music, they didn't consider the impact on others. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the concert's vibe encouraged movement, and the author was just being a fan. But concert etiquette usually prioritizes the view for those seated behind. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the seating arrangement and the requests of those behind them.\n"
