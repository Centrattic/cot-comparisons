It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for standing up at a concert even though people behind them asked them to sit down. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The concert is for Elton John at Madison Square Garden. They're in the floor section with risers, so seating is sloped. During the concert, people in front stand up, and the AITA joins them. The people behind, an older couple and others, start asking them to sit. The AITA complies during a slow song but stands again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" ignoring requests. The older couple gets angry and sarcastic clapping happens. The AITA reacts with a dirty look. Later, a young couple apologizes, feeling pressured by the older group.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the AITA is wrong for standing up despite being asked to sit. The concert setup has chairs, but many people stand. The author's reasoning is that it's a concert where people jam, so standing should be allowed.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Audience Etiquette**: In concerts, especially seated ones, blocking the view is generally frowned upon. If the AITA is standing and blocking those behind, that's an issue. However, in this case, the AITA was in the back rows. When they stood, maybe the older couple in the back couldn't see over them. The AITA did try to sit during a slow song but then stood again. The key is whether their standing was unreasonable.\n\n2. **Respect for Others**: The people behind had a right to enjoy the concert without being blocked. The AITA's refusal to comply might be seen as inconsiderate. Even though the author tried to mediate by asking the front rows to sit, the conflict escalated when they refused again later.\n\n3. **Cultural Norms**: At some concerts, especially with older attendees, standing might be more disruptive. The author defends their actions by comparing to others, but if everyone stands, the entire back section might block the view, which the venue might not account for. However, in this case, the AITA was in the back, so maybe the front rows are designed to handle that. But the older couple couldn't see, so that's a problem.\n\n4. **Proportionality of Response**: The AITA's dirty look might be seen as an escalation. However, the older couple was yelling, which could justify a reaction.\n\n5. **Venue Layout**: The risers are meant to provide a good view. If the front rows stand, the back rows might have an obstructed view. The AITA's standing might be against the intended design, making them at fault.\n\n6. **Intent vs. Outcomes**: The AITA wanted to enjoy the concert like others, but their actions caused others discomfort. The older couple's frustration is valid because they can't see. The AITA might not have considered the impact of their actions on others, especially those in higher seats.\n\n7. **Resolution**: The young couple apologized, indicating that the pressure from the older group was unwarranted. Maybe the older couple was overly strict, but that doesn't absolve the AITA of blocking their view.\n\nIn conclusion, the AITA might be partially at fault for not respecting the requests to sit, which directly affected others' viewing experience. Even though they tried to mediate once, the continued standing during other songs shows a disregard for others' needs. The venue's seating is designed to accommodate standing in front rows, but the AITA's position in the back means their standing could block those behind. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing.\n"
