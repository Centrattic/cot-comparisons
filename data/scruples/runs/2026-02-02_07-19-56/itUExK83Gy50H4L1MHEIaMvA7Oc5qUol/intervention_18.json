It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about standing up at an Elton John concert despite people behind them asking to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. They were in the back rows with chairs on risers. When the concert started, people in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind, an older couple and others, asked them to sit. They complied during a slower song. But then during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" they stood again, leading to frustration from the older couple who ended up clapping sarcastically. The author felt it was their right since everyone else was standing.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to stand up despite requests. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for my opinion.\n\nI should consider concert etiquette. Typically, if you're sitting in a seated area, you should stay seated to allow others behind you to see the show. However, sometimes people stand, especially if it's a more lively event. The key here is that the author was in a seated section, and their standing blocked the view for people behind them. The older couple was trying to enjoy their seated view without obstruction. The author's actions, even if they were following the crowd, caused discomfort to others.\n\nAlso, the author did sit down once when asked during a slower song, but then resumed standing during upbeat songs. The older couple's frustration escalated, leading to sarcastic clapping. The author's refusal to comply, even when directly asked by the couple behind, might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, Elton John concerts can be energetic, and some people might stand during certain songs. The author argues that if everyone else is standing, why shouldn't they? But the issue is the specific seating arrangement and the impact on those behind. The author's actions directly affected others' ability to see the concert, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, in concert etiquette, blocking the view is a common issue. If the venue is set up with seated sections, standing can be a problem. The author's decision to stand, despite being asked to sit, might be considered inconsiderate. Even if others are doing the same, their own actions still block those behind. The fact that they eventually sat down during a slower song shows some consideration, but the repeated standing during upbeat songs, especially when directly asked, seems to prioritize their own enjoyment over others' view.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consistently respect the requests of those behind them, which is a basic courtesy in such settings.\n"
