It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. They went to an Elton John concert, were seated in a back section with chairs on risers. When the concert started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined. The couple behind them, an older couple, asked them to sit so they could see. They tried to comply during a slower song but later stood again for popular songs. The older couple got angry, and there was some tension. The author feels it's their right to stand since everyone else is doing it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about concert etiquette, blocking views, and respecting others' experiences. The author argues that since everyone else is standing, they should be allowed too. But the people behind them, especially the older couple, were clearly struggling to see because the author and others were standing. \n\nConcert venues usually have a policy where you're seated to ensure everyone can see the stage. If the venue provided chairs, maybe standing is against the norm. However, sometimes people do stand, especially for high-energy songs. But the problem arises when it blocks the view for others. The author's actions, while they might be common, directly affected the people behind them. \n\nThe older couple was being respectful by asking, and the author chose to ignore their requests after a point. That seems inconsiderate. Even if others are doing the same, it doesn't negate the request from those behind. The author's justification is that it's a concert where people jam, but if the venue is structured for seating, they might be violating the intended setup. \n\nAlso, the author took it further by giving a dirty look after sarcastic clapping, which adds to the conflict. The young couple behind ended up apologizing for the pressure from others, implying the author wasn't entirely to blame, but the older couple might have been more aggressive. However, the core issue is whether the author had a right to block the view despite being asked to sit. \n\nIn most cases, concert etiquette suggests that if you're seated, you should stay seated so others can enjoy the concert without obstruction. Standing in a seated section is usually frowned upon. So the author's actions might be considered inconsiderate, especially since they were in a back section where blocking the view for others is more impactful. \n\nBut the author argues that everyone in front was standing, so they felt it was okay. That might be a valid point if the venue allows standing in front rows, but the people behind are still affected. There's a balance between enjoying the concert and respecting others' experience. The fact that they tried to sit during a slower song shows some consideration, but then stood again for another song. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have felt they were part of the crowd's natural movement, their actions directly impacted others' ability to see the show. The older couple's frustration is understandable, and the author's refusal to comply with their requests, despite knowing they were causing a problem, leans towards the author being in the wrong. So probably answer A.\n"
