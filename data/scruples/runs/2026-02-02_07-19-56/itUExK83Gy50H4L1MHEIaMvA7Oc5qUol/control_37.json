It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for standing up at the concert despite people behind them asking them to sit down. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe user went to an Elton John concert at Madison Square Garden. They were in the back section of the floor seats on risers. When the show started, everyone in front of them stood up and started dancing, so they joined in. After the second song, an older couple behind them asked them to sit down. The user tried to be respectful by sitting down during a slower song and even asked the people in front to sit so they could see. Then when the songs got upbeat again like \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" they stood up again, which made the older couple angry and led to sarcastic clapping and a dirty look from the user. The young couple behind them later apologized for feeling pressured by the people behind them. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about concert etiquette and respecting others' lines of sight. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the user was in a sloped seating arrangement. If they're in the back, standing up would block the view for people behind them. The older couple is asking them to sit down so they can see the stage. The user did sit down once during a slower song, which helped. But when the music picked up again, they stood up again, which the older couple found frustrating. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that everyone else is standing, so why shouldn't they? But the issue is that they were blocking the view for others. In concert settings, especially in seated areas, the expectation is that if you stand up, you might block people behind you. So if others are asking you to sit down to maintain their view, it's considered polite to do so. However, the user tried to accommodate by sitting during slower songs, which shows they weren't completely inconsiderate. \n\nBut when the music became more upbeat again, they chose to stand again despite the requests. The older couple was upset, and the user responded with a dirty look. That escalation might be a problem. The user's argument is that it's an Elton John concert, and people were dancing, so they should be allowed to do the same. But the problem is that their actions are affecting others' experience. \n\nI think the main ethical consideration here is balancing personal enjoyment with the comfort of others. While concerts are about enjoying the music, if your actions (like standing up) are directly impacting others' ability to see the show, you have a responsibility to consider them. The user did make an effort once by sitting during a slower song, but then continued to stand when it was causing issues again. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They did comply once but then ignored further requests. The older couple's frustration is understandable, and the user's response (dirty look) isn't helpful. However, the user could argue that they were just trying to enjoy the concert like others. But since they were blocking people, they might be at fault for not maintaining a seated position once asked. \n\nI'm leaning towards the user being at least somewhat in the wrong because they chose to stand up multiple times despite knowing it was causing a problem for others. Even if the concert had a dance vibe, the seating arrangement meant that standing up was a choice that affected others. So the answer might be A (Yes, they're in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because concerts can be lively, and people do stand up sometimes. However, the key here is the repeated requests to sit down to not block others.\n"
