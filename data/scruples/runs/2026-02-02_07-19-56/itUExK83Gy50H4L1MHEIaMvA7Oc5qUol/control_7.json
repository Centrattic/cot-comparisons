It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind asking them to sit down. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is at an Elton John concert. They\u2019re in the back rows on a sloped seating arrangement. When the show starts, everyone in front stands up, so they join in. The people behind, an older couple surrounded by younger ones, ask them to sit down. The author complies during a slower song. But during \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stand again with others. The older couple gets angry, and the author refuses, ends up getting sarcastic claps, and they all part ways.\n\nSo, the main question is whether standing up is acceptable here. Let's think about concert etiquette. In general, if the venue provides seating, people might expect to stay seated. However, concerts with a lot of movement often have standing areas. But in this case, it's floor seats with chairs. The author's decision to stand might block the view for people behind, which is a common issue. \n\nThe author tried to be respectful initially by sitting down during a slower song. But when they stood again during a popular song, others were upset. The key point is whether the author's actions were considerate of others' viewing experience. Even if most people are standing, if there's a specific reason someone needs to sit (like the older couple), blocking their view could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that after the slower song, they stood again when others did, but the people behind were still upset. The author might argue that it's part of the concert experience, but the fact that they were in the back rows on a slope suggests that standing could obstruct the view more significantly. \n\nAnother angle: The author's actions led to tension with the older couple, who were clearly frustrated. The younger couple behind them felt pressured but apologized later. The author's refusal to sit down might be seen as selfish, prioritizing their own enjoyment over others' ability to see the show. \n\nBut then again, concerts are about enjoying the music, and standing is a common response to energetic songs. The author could argue that everyone else was doing it, so it's part of the experience. However, the seating arrangement was designed for sitting, so maybe there's an expectation to remain seated unless there's a standing area. \n\nI think the main issue is blocking the view. Even if others are standing, if the people behind can't see because of the author's actions, then it's their fault. The author should have considered that and found a compromise, maybe by sitting more often or adjusting their position to minimize obstruction. \n\nAlso, the fact that the older couple was getting angry and the author responded with a dirty look shows a lack of consideration. The author's actions led to a hostile environment, which is not good. Even if they wanted to enjoy the concert, they should have been more mindful of others' needs. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consistently consider the people behind them, leading to conflict and a poor experience for others.\n"
