It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite being asked to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They were at an Elton John concert, seated in the back rows on risers. During the concert, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind them, an older couple surrounded by younger couples, asked them to sit down. They tried to accommodate by sitting during a slower song, but when the music picked up again, they stood back up. The older couple got angry and even sarcastically clapped, leading to tension.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The key points here are about respect and consideration for others' viewpoints. The concert provided chairs, which might imply a more seated audience, but the crowd's behavior (everyone standing) could suggest a different expectation. The author's actions were based on joining in with the majority, but the people behind them had a different preference, possibly due to age or physical comfort.\n\nConcert etiquette can vary, but generally, if you're blocking someone's view or disturbing others, you should adjust. Since the author was in the back rows, standing might have obstructed the view for the people behind them. Even though they tried to sit during a slower song, the continued standing during upbeat songs might have been a recurring issue. The fact that others near them also stood up suggests a social norm of participation, but the author should consider the specific needs of those behind them, especially if they're older or less able to stand.\n\nThe author's justification is that it's an Elton John concert where people are jamming, but the presence of chairs and the structure of the venue (risers) might mean that sitting is expected. The conflict arises from conflicting expectations between participation and comfort. The author might have been inconsiderate by not finding a middle ground, like partially standing or using their phone to see over, instead of insisting on full standing. The sarcastic clapping and the dirty look from the author escalate the situation, which isn't helpful.\n\nSo, balancing the enjoyment of the concert with consideration for others' comfort is key. The author might be in the wrong for not fully respecting the requests of the older couple, even if they were following the crowd. Concertgoers have a responsibility to be mindful of their surroundings and adjust when necessary to avoid causing discomfort. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
