It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when people behind them asked them to sit down. The situation is a bit nuanced.\n\nFirst, the concert was at Madison Square Garden with a sloped seating arrangement. The people in the back rows (the author and their group) stood up during the show, which blocked the view for the older couple behind them. The couple asked them to sit down, and the author initially complied but then stood up again during another song. Eventually, the author refused to sit, leading to the couple getting angry and sarcastic clapping. The author feels justified because everyone else was standing.\n\nSo, the core issue is about obstructing the view. Theaters and concerts often have policies where people in the back rows are supposed to sit to ensure those behind them can see. Even if others are standing, if the seating is designed to accommodate a sloped arrangement, the people in the front standing up could block the view for those behind. The author's actions, while perhaps in line with the crowd's behavior, may still be violating the unspoken social contract of the venue.\n\nThe author might argue that it's part of the concert experience to stand and dance. However, the key point is that the author was in a seated area, which implies they should respect the seating to allow people behind to see. The older couple paid for seats that presumably offer a good view, and the author's standing disrupted that. The fact that others were also standing might not absolve the author of responsibility if the venue expects seated sections to stay seated.\n\nAdditionally, the older couple's frustration escalated to yelling and sarcastic clapping, which the author responded to with a dirty look. This indicates a breakdown in social courtesy. While the author might feel entitled to enjoy the concert, they also have a responsibility to consider others. The resolution where the young couple apologized suggests that the older couple's pressure might have been unwarranted, but the initial issue of obstructing the view remains.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, while perhaps common in a less formal setting, likely interfered with the experience of those behind them in a seated venue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
