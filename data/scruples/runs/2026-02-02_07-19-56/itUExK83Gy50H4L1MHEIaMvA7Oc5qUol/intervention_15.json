It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when people behind them asked them to sit down. The situation is at an Elton John concert where the author is in the back rows on risers. They joined others in standing during songs, but the people behind, an older couple and their neighbors, kept asking them to sit. The author eventually refused, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Concert etiquette can vary, but generally, people tend to follow the crowd's behavior. In this case, the author was in a section with seats on risers. The people in front were standing, so the author stood to see the stage. That's understandable because if you can't see the stage, it's frustrating. However, the issue arises because the people behind them were disturbed by their standing.\n\nThe key points here are visibility and respect for others. The older couple might have a legitimate concern if the author's standing blocked their view. Concert venues often set up seating to ensure everyone can see, especially when there are risers. However, if the author is in a section where standing is common during performances, maybe the venue expects that.\n\nThe author did try to sit during slower songs, which shows some consideration, but during popular songs like \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" they chose to stand again. The people behind them felt harassed and even got sarcastic clapping. The author responded with a dirty look, which might escalate tension.\n\nI think both sides have points. The author's right to enjoy the concert as others are doing, but also the responsibility not to block others. Maybe the venue's seating arrangement should account for this, but in reality, if standing is causing a problem for those behind, the author should have found a compromise. The fact that the young couple behind them later apologized suggests that the older couple's pressure was undue, but the author's refusal to sit despite knowing the impact might be inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because everyone has the right to enjoy the concert, but they might have been inconsiderate. However, according to the question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide based on the scenario. Since the author chose to stand even when others behind were affected, and the venue provided seating, maybe the correct answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they prioritized their own enjoyment over others' visibility. Alternatively, if the venue expects standing during certain songs, then B. But given that the people behind were frustrated, A might be more appropriate.\n"
