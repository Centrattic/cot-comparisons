It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when people behind them asked them to sit down.\n\nSo the situation is an Elton John concert at Madison Square Garden. They were in the floor seats in the back, on risers. The author and the people in front stood up during the concert. The people behind, an older couple and others, kept asking them to sit down. The author tried to accommodate once during a slow song but then continued standing during other songs. The older couple got angry, and the author ended up clapping sarcastically at them.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect and consideration. The people behind the author were likely sitting in seats that made it hard for them to see if those in front were standing. The author mentioned that they were in a sloped seating arrangement. So when they stood up, they might have blocked the view of the people behind. The older couple's frustration makes sense because they can't see the show properly.\n\nThe author argues that everyone else was standing, so why not them? But the issue is that their seats are near the back, so standing would block the view for those behind. Even if others are standing, if they're in a position where their standing affects others, they might be in the wrong for not considering the people behind them. The author did try to sit down once, but then continued standing again. The people behind them, especially the older couple, were upset and felt their view was being obstructed.\n\nOn the other hand, concerts often have different expectations. Some people go to dance and stand, others to sit. The author might feel they're entitled to enjoy the music by standing, but if their actions prevent others from enjoying the show, that's a problem.\n\nSo, considering the seating arrangement and the impact on others, the author might be in the wrong for not consistently sitting down to allow the people behind to have a clear view. Even if it's a concert where standing is common, those in the back might need to sit to avoid blocking others. The author's refusal to sit when asked, despite knowing it affected others, could be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
