It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when people behind them asked to sit down. The situation is at an Elton John concert with a sloped seating arrangement. The author was in the back rows, and when everyone in front stood up, they joined in. The people behind, an older couple and others, kept asking them to sit down. The author tried to accommodate by sitting during a slower song, but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and other upbeat songs. The older couple got angry, and they ended up clapping sarcastically. The author feels justified because everyone else was standing, and they were just enjoying the music.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Concert etiquette can vary. In some concerts, especially with standing areas, people expect others to stand. But in seated sections, blocking the view might be an issue. The author was in a seated area with risers, so standing could block the view for those behind. However, the author was in the back rows, so their standing might not block as much as someone in the front. Also, they tried to sit during a slower song to accommodate the older couple. But when the music picked up again, they stood again with everyone else.\n\nThe key points here are respect for others' view and the social norm of the event. The author argues that if everyone else is standing, why shouldn't they? But the people behind had a legitimate complaint about being blocked. The author's actions caused frustration, leading to arguments. However, the author also tried to mediate by asking others to sit, but the problem resurfced when the music changed.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author was following the crowd, but their actions affected others. However, the concert setup might have contributed to the issue. In some cases, seated sections with risers are designed to allow standing without blocking. Still, the older couple's perspective is valid\u2014they couldn't see because the author and others stood. The fact that the young couple behind them later apologized suggests that the pressure from the older group was significant. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's right to enjoy the concert is also a factor. Elton John's music is often lively, and people might expect some standing. The author might not be in the wrong if the venue's setup allows such behavior. However, their refusal to sit even after being asked multiple times could be seen as inconsiderate. The sarcastic clapping from the older couple indicates a breach in social norms.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author tried to compromise but didn't fully resolve the issue. The older couple's right to an unobstructed view is important, especially in a seated section. The author's actions, while following the crowd, still caused a disturbance. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility, but it's not entirely their fault. However, since they were in the back and others in front stood, maybe the main issue was the older couple's proximity and the venue's design. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the concert had assigned seating with a clear expectation to remain seated, then the author would be wrong. However, if it's common for people in the seated sections to stand during songs, then it's more understandable. The author's actions were in line with others, but they ignored the specific requests of those behind them. The fact that they tried to sit once but then stood again might show they were trying to be respectful but didn't follow through. \n\nIn the end, the answer might lean towards the author being a little in the wrong because they didn't fully respect the requests of those behind them, even if others were doing the same. But the situation is nuanced. The correct answer might be a mix of both, but the options are A or B. Considering the scenario, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because the concert environment and collective behavior justify standing, and the venue's setup might be part of the issue. However, the repeated refusal to sit after being asked could tip it towards A. It's tricky. The fact that the young couple apologized to the author suggests that the pressure from the older group was undue, which might indicate that the author wasn't entirely at fault. So, maybe B.\n"
