It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The scenario is from the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) subreddit.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author was at an Elton John concert, sitting in the floor section with chairs on risers. During the concert, they stood up when others did. The people behind, an older couple, asked them to sit down so they could see the stage. The author initially complied but later refused during a popular song, leading to conflict.\n\nKey points to consider: The author was in a sloped seating arrangement. When people in front stand, it blocks those behind. The author was in a back section, so standing would block more seats. The older couple was struggling to see, which is a valid concern. The author stood up during a song everyone else was doing, but the people behind had a right to visibility. The author's refusal to sit down might have been inconsiderate, even if others were also standing. The sarcastic clapping and confrontation suggest the older couple felt disrespected.\n\nThe author might argue that it's a concert where people naturally stand, but seating is provided. The venue's setup probably expects seated viewers. The author's actions affected others' experience. Even if others were standing, the author was in a position to accommodate the couple. The refusal to sit, especially when asked, could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's justification about wanting to enjoy the music doesn't override the impact on others. The young couple later apologized, indicating some understanding from others.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, being considerate and resolving conflicts politely is important. The author didn't address the requests respectfully beyond the first time. Continuing to stand despite ongoing complaints shows a lack of consideration. So, the author is partially at fault for not finding a middle ground. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
