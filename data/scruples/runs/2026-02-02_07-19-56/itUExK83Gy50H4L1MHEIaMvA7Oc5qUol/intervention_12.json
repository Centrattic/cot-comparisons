It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) thread.\n\nFirst, the author and their group were in the back rows at an Elton John concert. When the show started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind them, an older couple and others, started asking them to sit down. The author tried to accommodate during a slower song but then resumed standing during another song, leading to more complaints and even sarcastic clapping. The author ended up ignoring the requests and gave dirty looks.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's the case. \n\nFactors to consider: concerts often have varying audience behaviors. Some people want to stand and dance, others prefer sitting. The venue provided chairs, so maybe they were expected to use them. However, if everyone around is standing, it's natural to follow the crowd. The author tried to sit once but then stood again when others did. The main conflict is about respect for others' views. The older couple couldn't see the stage because the author was standing. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered the people behind them from the start. Even if others were standing, blocking the view for others could be rude. The author did sit once but then resumed, showing maybe they prioritized their own enjoyment over others' comfort. The older couple was upset enough to yell and get others to do the same, which is not great, but the author's refusal to sit might have escalated tensions. \n\nIn concerts, especially seated ones, people expect to have an unobstructed view. Standing up might hinder others' experience. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, especially after multiple requests. Even if they felt everyone else was standing, the people behind had a legitimate grievance. The author might have been in the wrong for not accommodating the requests and causing a disruption. So answer A.\n"
