It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite being asked to sit down by people behind them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from the details provided. The concert is for Elton John, which is a big event. The couple is in the back rows on the floor, which are set up on risers. When the show starts, everyone in front of them stands up and starts dancing, so they join in. After the second song, the people behind them, an older couple, ask them to sit down. The couple complies during a slower song but later stands up again during a more upbeat song. The people behind get upset, the older couple yells, and the writer ends up shooting a dirty look. The young couple later apologizes, saying they felt pressured by the older ones.\n\nThe key points here are about respect for others' views and the concert etiquette. The main issue seems to be that the couple's standing up is blocking the view for the people behind them. Even though the majority of the audience is standing, the people in the back rows (the ones behind them) have a legitimate issue if their view is obstructed. \n\nWhen the couple first stood up, they might not have realized they were blocking the view, but when the older couple asked them to sit, the couple did sit down during a slower song. However, they then stood up again during a more energetic song, which reignited the problem. The writer's justification is that it's an Elton John concert where people are dancing, and they should be allowed to participate. However, the counterpoint is that in a seated concert, unless there's a standing area, people in the back have a right to an unobstructed view.\n\nThe writer's actions led to the older couple being upset and even sarcastically clapping. The writer's response of ignoring the requests and giving a dirty look adds to the conflict. While dancing is part of the concert experience, the writer's choice to stand up repeatedly, despite being asked to sit, could be seen as inconsiderate towards the people behind them, especially in a seated section where blocking the view is a real issue. \n\nConsidering concert etiquette, if someone's standing up is blocking others, it's generally expected to sit down to maintain the view for those behind. The fact that the writer tried to mediate by asking the people in front to sit down shows they tried to be considerate initially. However, continuing to stand up despite being asked again by the couple behind seems to prioritize their own enjoyment over others' comfort. \n\nSo, while the writer might not be the sole \"asshole\" if the majority of the audience was standing, their refusal to accommodate the specific requests of the people behind them, leading to conflict, does place some responsibility on them. The older couple's frustration is valid, and the writer's decision to ignore repeated requests could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the writer being in the wrong.\n"
