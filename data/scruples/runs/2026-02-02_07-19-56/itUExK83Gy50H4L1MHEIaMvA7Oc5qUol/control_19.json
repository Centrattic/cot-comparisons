It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an Elton John concert where they were sitting in the floor seats on risers. They stood up during the music, and people behind them kept asking them to sit down. The author and their group tried to accommodate by sitting during slower songs but then continued standing during upbeat songs despite the requests.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, in seated areas, people are expected to stay seated unless the venue allows standing. However, sometimes at concerts, especially with certain artists, people might stand up to dance or sing along, especially if the crowd does. The author mentions that everyone in front of them stood up, so maybe they followed the crowd's lead.\n\nBut the problem here is that the people behind them couldn't see the stage because the author's group and those in front were standing. The couple behind is an older couple, which might make it harder for them to see over the crowd. The author tried to sit during slower songs but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" which are probably more energetic songs. When the older couple got angry and others clapped sarcastically, the author responded with a dirty look.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did their standing up block the view? They were in a sloped seating arrangement, which is designed to provide a good view for everyone. If they stood up, even if the rows in front were also up, it could create a barrier. The fact that they had to sit down for others to see suggests that their standing was indeed blocking the view. The author might have been inconsiderate by not maintaining a seated position when asked, even if others were doing the same. However, they did try to comply sometimes.\n\nOn the other hand, the concert wasn't in a pit, so maybe standing is expected. But the venue provided chairs, implying a seated arrangement. The author's actions caused frustration for the couple behind, leading to conflict. Even though the group in front was also standing, the author's refusal to sit down after multiple requests might be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that others eventually apologized to the author suggests that the pressure from the older couple was undue, but that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility if their actions were the root cause.\n\nSo, balancing the enjoyment of the concert with consideration for others is important. The author's stance might be reasonable in a setting where standing is common, but since their actions directly impacted others' experience, they might be at fault for not respecting the requests to sit down to ensure visibility for all. The older couple's frustration is understandable if they couldn't see due to the standing crowd. The author's decision to stand despite knowing it blocked the view could be seen as inconsiderate, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
