It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is at an Elton John concert where they were in the floor seats on risers. They stood up during the songs, and people behind them, an older couple, kept asking them to sit down. The author and their group initially tried to accommodate by sitting during a slower song but then went back to standing for songs like \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom.\" The older couple got angry and sarcastic, and the author ended up giving them a dirty look.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. In many concerts, especially for artists like Elton John, it's common for people to stand and dance, even in seated sections. However, if someone is blocking the view of others behind them, that's a problem. The key here is whether the author's actions were obstructing the view for others. \n\nThe author mentions that they were in a back section on risers. If the people in front were standing, they might be blocking the view for those behind. But the author and their group tried to sit during a slower song to let the older couple see the stage. However, when the more energetic songs started, they stood again along with the crowd. The people in front also stood, so maybe the author wasn't the only ones blocking. \n\nThe older couple's frustration could be because they wanted to have an unobstructed view, especially if they're seated and not used to standing. But the author argues that it's a concert where people are expected to stand. The fact that others were also standing might mean the author isn't solely responsible. Also, the young couple behind them later apologized, saying they felt pressured by the older ones. That suggests the older couple might have been the ones creating tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did initially try to accommodate by sitting during a slower song. They refused to sit during the more upbeat songs, which might be seen as stubbornness, but if everyone else is standing, it's hard to argue against their right to stand. The author's actions during the songs when others were also standing might not be inconsiderate. The problem arises when their standing blocks others' view. However, if the venue is designed with risers, perhaps the sightlines are already considered in the setup. Maybe the people in the back should have chosen seats that account for possible standing in front. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have a point that it's a concert where standing is part of the experience. But if their standing is directly causing a problem for others, maybe they should consider sitting more often. However, since others in front were also standing, the author might not be the main issue. The older couple's reaction seems exaggerated, and their sarcastic clapping and yelling might be more inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author's stance is that they were just participating in what others were doing, and the older couple's requests were unreasonable. The key question is whether the author was inconsiderate by refusing to sit when asked if it was affecting the view. But if the venue is set up to handle standing in front, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The fact that the young couple apologized later indicates that the older couple's demands were perhaps unwarranted. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were following the crowd, and the issue stems more from the older couple's sensitivity. The answer would be B (No).\n"
