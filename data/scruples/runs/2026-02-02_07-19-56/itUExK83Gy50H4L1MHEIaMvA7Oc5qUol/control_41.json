It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a concert where they stood up during songs, even though people behind them asked them to sit down. The writer argues that everyone else was standing, so they should be allowed to too, especially since it's an upbeat song. But the people behind them were older and wanted to see the stage, so they got frustrated.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is about blocking the view. When you're in a concert with seating, especially in a sloped arrangement, standing up can block the view for people behind you. The writer mentions that they were in the back sections. If everyone in front is standing, then the people behind might not see the stage. The writer did initially sit down when asked, but then continued standing during other songs. The older couple started getting angry and others clapped sarcastically. \n\nI think the key points here are responsibility and consideration. Even though the writer felt it was okay because others were standing, their actions directly affected the people behind them. The fact that they ignored the requests after being asked multiple times, especially when the couple behind them was clearly upset, might make them at fault. They did try to compromise once by sitting during a slower song, but then ignored further requests. The young couple later apologized, indicating that the older couple's pressure was affecting others too.\n\nAlso, the venue provided chairs, which suggests they expect people to stay seated. Standing up in seated sections is generally frowned upon because of view obstruction. So even if others are doing it, the writer had a choice to consider the people behind. The writer's defense that \"everyone else is doing it\" doesn't absolve them from the responsibility to respect the seating arrangement and not block others. \n\nSo, the author probably is in the wrong because they disregarded the requests of those behind them, leading to a conflict. They should have prioritized the comfort and view of others, even if they wanted to stand. The fact that they stood up again despite being asked multiple times shows a lack of consideration. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
