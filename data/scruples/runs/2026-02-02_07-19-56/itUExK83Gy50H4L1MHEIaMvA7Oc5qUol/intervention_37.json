It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author attended an Elton John concert in a seated area. When the music started, everyone in front of them stood up, so they joined in. However, people behind them (an older couple and others) wanted them to sit so they could see the stage. The author complied during a slower song but then stood up again for other songs, leading to tension. The older couple got angry, and the author ended up clapping sarcastically in response. The author's main argument is that it's a concert where people are standing, so they should be allowed to do so, even if others are blocking the view.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are concert etiquette, consideration for others, and the specific seating arrangement. In concerts with a mix of seated and standing areas, it's generally expected that seated people should not stand up if it blocks the view for those behind them. However, in this case, it was a seated area with risers. The author was in a back section, so standing up would likely block the view of the people behind them. The people behind (the older couple) were probably in a higher row, which is common in such setups, so when the lower rows stand, they can block the higher ones. \n\nThe author did make an effort to sit during a slow song, which shows some consideration. However, when they stood again, especially during popular songs like \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" they ignored the requests from the people behind. The fact that the couple behind got angry and the author responded with a dirty look suggests that the author wasn't being considerate of their need to see the show. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that it's a concert where people are meant to stand and enjoy the music. However, the venue provided chairs, which implies that they might expect seated behavior. Also, the older couple's frustration is understandable because their view was obstructed. The author's actions led to a conflict and sarcastic clapping, which indicates a breakdown in social courtesy.\n\nSo, considering the balance between personal enjoyment and respect for others' experience, the author might be in the wrong. They should have been more accommodating to the people behind them, especially after being asked multiple times. While it's a concert and people do stand, the seating arrangement likely intended for seated sections to remain seated so that higher rows can see. The author's refusal to sit down despite the requests shows a lack of consideration.\n"
