It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite being asked by people behind them to sit down. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The concert is for Elton John, which is a big event. The seating is on the floor in a sloped arrangement with risers. The author and their group were in the back sections. When the concert started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind them, an older couple surrounded by younger couples, asked them to sit down. The author tried to be polite by sitting during a slower song and even asked others in front to sit down. But then during a popular song like \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood up again because everyone else did, and the people behind got angry, leading to some conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and concert etiquette. The author argues that if everyone else is standing, they should be allowed to do so. However, the people behind them had a legitimate issue because standing up blocked their view. The author's actions, even if they were following the crowd, might have been inconsiderate to those in the back. \n\nBut wait, the author did make an effort to sit down during a slower song, which shows they tried to accommodate the older couple. However, when the music picked up again, they stood up again, which the older couple found frustrating. The other people behind might have felt pressured by the older couple, leading to the young couple apologizing later.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they were part of a group that chose to stand, which is common in concerts, even if there are seats. On the other hand, their standing up repeatedly blocked the view for others who were seated behind them. The fact that the older couple was surrounded by younger couples might mean that the author's section was a bit of a middle ground. \n\nConcert etiquette usually says that if someone has seats, they should use them to allow people behind to see. But sometimes, people stand up even if they have seats, especially for a big show. However, in this case, the author was asked to sit down, and they ignored the requests after trying once. The older couple was upset because their view was blocked, and the author didn't consider their perspective beyond the initial attempt.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is that the author is partially in the wrong because they didn't consistently respect the requests from those behind them, even if the concert environment encourages standing. The balance between personal enjoyment and considering others' experiences is key here. The fact that others behind them also stood up might complicate things, but the main issue is that the author was in a position where their actions directly affected the older couple's view, and they didn't make a consistent effort to accommodate them.\n"
