It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking them to sit down. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer and their partner were at an Elton John concert in a seated floor section. They stood up during songs, and people behind them (an older couple and others) kept asking them to sit down so they could see the stage. The writer initially complied but then continued standing later, leading to the couple getting angry and sarcastic. The writer feels like they're not in the wrong because everyone else was standing too.\n\nSo the key points are:\n- The concert had assigned seating with chairs on risers.\n- The writer was in a back section, so standing up might block the view for those behind.\n- Others asked them to sit down for the sake of visibility.\n- The writer refused, arguing that others were standing too, so they should have the same right.\n\nNow, considering concert etiquette. Typically, in seated concerts, people are expected to stay seated unless there's a standing area or dance pit. If you're in a seated section, standing up can block the view for people behind you, which is generally considered rude because you're depriving others of their purchase. The fact that others were also standing might give the writer a sense of justification, but if the venue is set up for seating, the norm is to respect that to maintain everyone's view.\n\nThe writer mentions that when they stood up, people behind them asked them to sit. The writer then tried to have the people in front sit down to help the older couple see, but later ignored the requests again. The older couple got angry, the writer gave a dirty look, and the young couple later apologized, feeling pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the writer is in a position where their actions affect others. Even if others are standing, the initial request from the people behind is a valid concern. Refusing to sit down despite repeated requests, especially when it's impacting others' ability to see the show, could be seen as inconsiderate. The writer might argue that the venue setup isn't ideal, but the fact that chairs are provided usually means people are expected to use them to avoid blocking views. \n\nSo, while the writer might feel they're not at fault because others were standing, the core issue is about respecting the seating arrangement and others' right to see the concert. The older couple's frustration is understandable because their view is being obstructed. The writer's refusal to comply even after being asked multiple times could be seen as inconsiderate, making them at least partially at fault. However, the situation is nuanced because the venue setup might contribute to the problem. But generally, in seated areas, standing up and blocking others is considered rude. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
