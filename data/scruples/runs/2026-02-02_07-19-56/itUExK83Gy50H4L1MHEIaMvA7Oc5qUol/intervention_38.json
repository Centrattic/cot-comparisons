It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for standing up at the concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The situation is described in the AITA post where the author and others stood up during songs, which blocked the view for an older couple behind them. They tried to accommodate by sitting down during slower songs but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" leading to frustration from the couple. The author ends by questioning if they were at fault.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if I agree. The options are A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points are: the author was in a seated section but chose to stand during performances, blocking the view of those behind. The people behind were an older couple who couldn't see over the standing crowd. The author did attempt to sit during slower songs but then stood again during more upbeat songs. The older couple became angry and started sarcastic clapping, leading to tension.\n\nIn such situations, the general etiquette at concerts is that if you're in a seated area, you should consider the view for those behind you. Standing up can block others' sightlines, especially if they're seated further back. The author tried to compromise by sitting during slower songs, but the issue arises when they stand again during popular, energetic songs when others are also standing. The problem is that even if the majority is standing, if you're in a section that's designed for sitting, you might be expected to remain seated to avoid blocking others. \n\nThe user's argument is that the author should have stayed seated to respect the views of those behind, even if others were standing. The author's defense is that it's an Elton John concert and people generally stand to dance. However, the venue provided chairs, implying that seated viewing is expected. The fact that the younger couple behind the author felt pressured to ask for them to sit down suggests that there's a social expectation to accommodate those with a more distant view. \n\nAdditionally, the author's refusal to sit down despite the couple's increasing frustration, and the subsequent sarcastic clapping and dirty looks, indicates that their actions caused discomfort. While the author might feel it's their right to enjoy the concert as they see fit, concert etiquette often prioritizes the experience of those who are seated further back, especially if they have purchased seats in a section that's supposed to provide an unobstructed view. \n\nTherefore, even though the author tried to find a middle ground, their continued standing during the songs likely caused more issues than necessary. The correct action might have been to remain seated to avoid blocking the view entirely, even if they wanted to dance. Since the concert provided seating, perhaps the venue expects seated behavior to maintain sightlines for all.\n"
