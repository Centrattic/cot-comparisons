It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an Elton John concert where they got floor seats. When the concert started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. But the people behind them, an older couple and others, kept asking them to sit down. They tried to sit during a slower song and even asked the people in front to sit so they could see. Then during \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood again with the crowd, but the people behind were upset. The older couple got angry, and the author gave them a dirty look. The author feels like they were just being respectful of the concert atmosphere where everyone stands, even though chairs were provided.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect and consideration for others. The author is in a back row with chairs. When people stand up, those in the back might not have a good view. So, the people behind them, especially older people, might need to sit to see the stage. The author tried to accommodate by sitting during a slower song, but then continued standing during other songs. The older couple was frustrated because they couldn't see. \n\nBut Elton John concerts usually have people dancing, so maybe the author thought it was part of the experience. However, the problem is blocking the view for others. Even if chairs are provided, if standing up prevents others from seeing, that's a problem. The author might have been inconsiderate by not consistently sitting when others needed to see. Also, they ignored requests despite the young couple's mediation. The sarcastic clapping and dirty look escalated things. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they prioritized their own enjoyment over the view of others, especially when accommodations were possible. On the other hand, if the concert culture is about dancing, it's a bit of a conflict between personal enjoyment and others' needs. But the main issue is blocking the view. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
