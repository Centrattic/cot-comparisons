It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. So, the scenario involves a concert where the author is in the back rows, and during the show, people in front stand up, so they join in. The people behind them, an older couple, are upset and ask them to sit down. The author complies during a slower song but stands again for some songs, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Typically, when people stand during concerts, especially when there are seats, it can block the view for others behind. So, if you're in a higher row or back rows, standing might be inconsiderate. But in this case, the author is in the floor seats on risers. Maybe their seats are elevated, so standing might not block as much as if they were in the front. However, the people behind them are older and might have difficulty seeing if those in front are standing. \n\nThe author mentions that when they first stood, the people in front also stood, so maybe the author's standing was part of a group. But when asked by the older couple, they tried to sit during a slow song. However, when the songs picked up again, they stood again, ignoring the ongoing requests. The key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable considering the complaints from the people behind them.\n\nConcert etiquette often suggests that if people behind you ask you to sit, it's polite to comply to let them have a good view. The author seems to be prioritizing their own enjoyment over others' views, especially when there's a clear request. The fact that the people behind them were an older couple and others were pressuring them might add context\u2014maybe they found standing uncomfortable. The author's refusal and eventual confrontation (dirty look) could be seen as inconsiderate or rude.\n\nOn the flip side, the author argues that it's an Elton John concert, and many people are standing to enjoy the music. They feel it's their right to participate. However, the presence of seats implies that sitting is expected, especially to maintain visibility for those behind. The author's behavior might be seen as selfish if they repeatedly ignore requests to sit, even if others around them are also standing.\n\nThe young couple behind eventually apologized, indicating that the pressure from the older couple was a factor. The author might not have been entirely in the wrong if they felt the concert environment encouraged standing, but their refusal to comply with multiple requests could be a point against them. It's a balance between personal enjoyment and consideration for others. In such cases, the general consensus often leans towards accommodating the audience behind you, especially if they are in a less optimal position (like older individuals who might not find it easy to see over people's heads).\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they disregarded repeated requests from those behind them, even if the concert had a standing culture. The key is the ongoing nature of the requests and the author's decision to stand despite knowing it was causing discomfort.\n"
