It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the concert is at Madison Square Garden, seating on the floor with risers. The author and their group are in the back sections. When the show starts, everyone in front stands up, so they join in. Then people behind them, an older couple and others, ask them to sit down. The author complies during a slower song but then stands up again during \"Tiny Dancer,\" ignoring requests from the older couple. The author argues that it's an Elton John concert where people usually stand to jam, and that they're in the back so maybe they can stand without blocking.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect for other attendees. The older couple is frustrated because they can't see the stage if people behind them stand. The author is in the back, but maybe even from there, standing could block the view for those behind. The author mentions asking the front rows to sit down, implying that they were trying to be polite initially. However, when they refuse later, the older couple becomes angry and sarcastic. The author retaliates with a dirty look.\n\nSo, the question is whether standing up despite being asked is wrong. In concerts, there's usually an expectation that if you have seated tickets, you should stay seated unless there's a standing area. However, sometimes people stand up anyway, especially in certain genres. The author's reasoning is that others are doing it too, so it's fair. But the problem is the people behind can't see, so it's a visibility issue. The author might be in the wrong because they chose to stand even after being asked, creating a conflict. However, maybe the venue's setup allows for standing, and the author isn't blocking anyone if they're in the back. But the older couple might have a valid point if the standing is obstructing their view. \n\nThe author's actions led to tension and the older couple getting angry. Even if others are standing, the author could have considered the people behind by sitting down, especially since they were asked. The fact that the young couple apologized suggests that the pressure from the older couple was inappropriate. But the author's refusal might still be seen as inconsiderate. So, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they ignored the requests, leading to conflict. However, if the concert environment inherently allows for standing, the author might not be entirely at fault. It's a bit of a grey area, but I think the consensus might be that the author is in the wrong because they disregarded others' needs for visibility.\n"
