It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down.\n\nFirst, the context: they were at an Elton John concert in a seated floor section. They stood up during songs, which is common at concerts, but others behind them (an older couple and others) wanted them to sit to see the stage. The couple tried to mediate by getting the front rows to sit, but eventually refused when they wanted to stand during popular songs. The older couple got angry and sarcastically clapped, leading to tension.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the concert provided chairs, so maybe people expected seating. The couple behind them had a right to a clear view. The writer could have considered the people behind them, especially the older couple who might have difficulty seeing if everyone in front is standing. \n\nOn the other hand, concerts often have standing during energetic songs, and the writer was part of the majority doing the same. They tried to accommodate by sitting during slower songs. The younger couple behind even apologized later, indicating they felt the pressure wasn't justified. The writer might argue that they're part of the crowd's natural behavior.\n\nBut the key point is whether standing up obstructs the view. If the seating was designed with risers, maybe standing wasn't an issue. However, the people behind were complaining, so the writer's actions did affect others. The writer's refusal to sit down despite the requests could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if it's a concert where standing is common, respecting others' views is a consideration.\n\nThe writer did ask the front rows to sit to help the older couple initially, but then chose not to comply when it suited them. That inconsistency might make them in the wrong. The older couple's frustration is valid if their view was blocked repeatedly. The writer might not have considered the impact on others, especially given the seating arrangement's purpose.\n\nSo, while concerts allow for standing, the writer's refusal to sit when it's affecting others' experience could make them at fault. Answer A (Yes) seems appropriate because they disregarded others' needs in favor of their own enjoyment, even after being asked.\n"
