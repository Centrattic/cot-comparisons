It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: At an Elton John concert, the author and others stand during upbeat songs, which blocks the view for people behind. They were in the back sections of a sloped seating arrangement. The older couple behind gets frustrated, asks them to sit, and the author eventually complies during a slower song. Then they stand again later, leading to more tension, including sarcastic clapping from the older couple. The author defends their right to enjoy the music like others.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is in a seated area but stands up during songs, which is common in concerts, but it's causing a problem for those behind. The seating is designed to allow visibility, so standing blocks others. The author acknowledges that they should respect the older couple's need to see, so they sit down once, but then stand again when the music starts. The older couple gets angry, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFrom a concert etiquette perspective, there's a balance between enjoying the show and respecting others' view. If the venue provides seats, standing during certain songs is typical, but if it blocks others, it's considered rude. The author tried to mitigate by sitting during a slower song, but then reverted. The fact that others around them are also standing suggests that the author isn't the only one, but it's still their choice to continue when asked. The older couple's frustration is understandable because they can't see the stage due to the standing crowd. The author's refusal to sit after being asked multiple times, especially when it affects others, seems inconsiderate. The older couple's sarcastic clapping and the author's dirty look escalate the tension, which is unhelpful. \n\nBut the author argues that it's an Elton John concert and everyone else is doing it. However, the problem is specifically their section blocking others. The fact that the young couple behind them apologized later indicates that the author might not have been the only one causing issues, but their actions still contributed. The author's justification of \"everyone else is doing it\" doesn't account for the direct impact on the people behind. So, while concerts do have standing moments, the author's refusal to accommodate those who can't see is where they might be in the wrong. They could have found a middle ground, like standing only when the people in front are also seated, or sitting when the songs are slower. The fact that they ignored the requests after the second time suggests they prioritized their own enjoyment over others' needs, which is where the wrongdoing lies.\n"
