It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a concert where the author and others stood up during songs, even though people behind them asked them to sit down. The author ended up clashing with an older couple and others, who got upset because they couldn't see the stage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The concert was at Madison Square Garden, with seats on risers. The author was in a back section, so when they stood up, it probably blocked the view for the people behind them. The key issue here is whether standing up is a reasonable action given the seating arrangement and the impact on others.\n\nThe author mentions that during an upbeat song like \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" they refused to sit down even when asked. But the main problem is that their standing up was causing a view obstruction. In such venues, it's generally expected that people will sit down if their standing blocks others' view, especially in a structured seating arrangement like risers. The fact that the people in front of them also stood up suggests that the author wasn't alone, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility for their own actions.\n\nThe older couple and others were clearly frustrated because they couldn't see the stage. The author tried to be respectful by sitting during a slower song, but then stood again during another song. The sarcastic clapping and the dirty look from the author indicate a breakdown in social courtesy. Even if the music is lively, the seating is supposed to provide a good view when seated. Standing up in a seated section can be seen as rude because it's considerate of others' experience.\n\nThe young couple behind them apologized, showing that the author's actions were causing pressure on others. The author's defense is that it's an Elton John concert and people usually stand to jam. However, the venue provided chairs, which implies that the organizers expected seated viewings. In such cases, the expectation is to respect the seating and not block others, even if the music is danceable.\n\nSo, considering the impact on others and the venue's setup, the author was in the wrong. They should have been more considerate of the people behind them and found a way to enjoy the concert without obstructing views, like standing only when necessary and ensuring others aren't affected. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
