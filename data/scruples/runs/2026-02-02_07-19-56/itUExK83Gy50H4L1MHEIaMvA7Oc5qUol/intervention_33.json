It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a concert where the author and others are standing up during songs, and the people behind them are upset because they can't see the stage. The author is trying to be respectful by sitting down sometimes, but then continues to stand during other songs like \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" even when asked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Generally, if you're in a seated section, you're supposed to stay seated so people behind you can see. But sometimes, especially at concerts where people tend to stand, there might be a bit of a compromise. The author was in a back section on risers, which probably makes sightlines a big deal. If everyone in front stands up, the people behind can't see, so it's a common courtesy to sit down when needed.\n\nThe author did sit down during a slower song, which was a good move. But then, when they stood up again for the next song, even after being asked, it might have blocked the view again. The older couple was frustrated because they couldn't see, and the younger couple felt pressured. The author's refusal to sit down, especially when the people behind were getting angry, might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also part of a crowd where everyone is standing and jamming. Maybe they felt it's part of the concert experience. But the key point is that their standing directly affects others' ability to enjoy the show. Even if the majority is standing, if there are people behind you who can't see because of it, you should make an effort to sit down when needed. The author's actions, while not malicious, could be considered inconsiderate because they caused discomfort to others. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't fully accommodate the people behind them, even after being asked. It's a balance between personal enjoyment and respecting others' experience. The fact that the young couple apologized later suggests that the author might have overstepped, as it's not just the older couple but also others who were affected. Therefore, the answer is probably A.\n"
