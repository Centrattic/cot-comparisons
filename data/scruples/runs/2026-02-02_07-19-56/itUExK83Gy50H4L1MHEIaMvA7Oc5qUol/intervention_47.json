It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did the right thing by standing up at the concert despite people behind them asking them to sit down.\n\nFirst, the setup: they were at an Elton John concert in a section with risers. When the show started, people in front stood up, and the author joined them. The people behind, an older couple, wanted them to sit so they could see the stage. The author agreed to sit during a slower song but then stood up again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" ignoring requests. The older couple got angry and sarcastic, and the author gave them a dirty look. The author's defense is that everyone else was standing, so why not them?\n\nHmm. So the main issue is blocking the view. The author chose seats on risers, which are supposed to give a better view. If people in front are standing, it can block the view for those behind. The author seems to have acknowledged this by asking others to sit down initially. But then they went back to standing again, even though the people behind were upset. The author probably feels they were within their rights because the event's atmosphere encouraged standing, but the people behind them had a legitimate concern about visibility.\n\nBut in a concert, especially seated sections, there's an expectation that you don't block the view. Even if others are standing, you should considerate those behind you. The author's actions were disruptive and inconsiderate. They refused to sit when asked and even got defensive. The older couple was just trying to enjoy the concert without being blocked. So the author is in the wrong here. They should have prioritized the comfort and ability of the people behind them to see the show. The author's justification that \"everyone is doing it\" doesn't hold because it's about blocking the view, not the event's rules about standing. So the answer is A.\n"
