It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about standing up at an Elton John concert when people behind them asked them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. They were at a concert with chairs, in a sloped seating area. When the show started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind them, an older couple, asked them to sit to see the stage. They complied during a slower song but then stood again during another song. The older couple got upset, and there was some tension. The author felt it's their right to stand since everyone else was doing it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the seating arrangement, the request to sit to improve visibility, and the author's response. The main issue is about respecting others' views versus personal enjoyment.\n\nThe concert venue had chairs, which might imply that seated view is expected. However, if everyone in front is standing, people behind might not have a good view. The author initially complied when asked, but then continued standing after the song ended. The older couple and others started clapping sarcastically, showing frustration.\n\nNow, considering concert etiquette. Generally, if someone's view is blocked, especially if they paid for seats, it's polite to sit down when asked. Even if others are standing, blocking someone's sightline is inconsiderate. The author might have the right to enjoy the concert, but that doesn't negate the other people's right to see the show.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's an Elton John concert and people are standing to jam. But the venue provided chairs, so maybe there's an expectation of seated view. Also, the younger couple behind them eventually apologized, indicating that they felt the pressure from the older couple. The author's refusal to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom\" might have been the tipping point.\n\nSo, the author did try to sit when possible but then chose to stand again. The key is whether their actions were reasonable. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but they could have been more considerate. However, the older couple's frustration is valid because their view was blocked. The author's decision to stand during upbeat songs is common in concerts, but the fact that they were in a seated section might mean they should have prioritized the people behind.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though they tried to accommodate, their continued standing after being asked again could be seen as selfish. Concert etiquette often requires balancing personal enjoyment with others' experience, and if others are being directly affected, the person blocking should make space. So, the author's refusal to sit when asked again shows a lack of consideration.\n"
