It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for standing up at an Elton John concert despite people behind them asking them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They were at a concert in a floor section with chairs on risers. During the show, everyone in front stood up, so they joined. People behind, an older couple with younger couples around, asked them to sit. They tried to comply during a slow song but then stood again when the music picked up. The older couple got angry, and sarcastic clapping happened. The author ends by saying if everyone is standing, why not them?\n\nSo, the key points here are about respecting others' needs versus personal enjoyment. The author argues that since others are standing, they should be allowed to too. But the people behind them (especially the older couple) likely have a harder time seeing over the standing crowd, so asking to sit makes sense. The author didn't consider that their standing might be blocking the view for those behind, even after being asked. \n\nIn public events, there's an expectation to consider others. If someone is seated and asks others to sit to have a good view, it's polite to comply. The author's refusal, even after being asked multiple times, could be seen as inconsiderate. While the concert's atmosphere is lively and people are dancing, the author's actions might have been causing discomfort to others. The fact that a young couple later apologized suggests that the author's behavior was indeed problematic, as others felt pressured to conform.\n\nOn the other hand, concerts are about enjoying the music, and if the venue allows standing, there's an argument for personal freedom. But since the author was in a seated section, maybe they were in a spot where standing would block others. The original setup with risers implies that seating is intended for that section, so standing might be against the venue's design.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the requests of those behind them, even if they were following the crowd in front. The older couple's frustration is valid, and the author's refusal to sit during certain songs could be seen as dismissive of others' needs. So, probably AITA A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
