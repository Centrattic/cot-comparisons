It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite others asking them to sit down. The person's reasoning is that at an Elton John concert, even though there are chairs, everyone stands for upbeat songs, so they felt they had the right to do the same. However, others behind them, especially an older couple, were upset and even started clapping sarcastically.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Generally, if you're seated, you should respect the view of those behind you. Standing up and blocking others is usually frowned upon, especially if they've paid for seats and expect a good view. But in some concerts, especially with live music, people might stand during certain parts. Maybe the venue allows for that, but if others are being obstructed, that's a problem.\n\nIn the scenario, the author was in the back rows. When people in front stood up, they joined in. Then, when the people behind asked them to sit, they did for a while. But when another lively song played, they stood again, leading to conflict. The key issue is whether standing up repeatedly despite being asked is inconsiderate. \n\nThe author might argue that everyone else is doing it, so it's okay. However, the specific problem here is that the people behind them are being blocked and feel frustrated. The older couple's frustration and the sarcastic clapping suggest a significant disturbance. The author did sit down during slower songs, which shows some compromise, but refusing to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom\" when asked might be seen as disregarding others' needs.\n\nAlso, the fact that even the young couple behind eventually apologized after feeling pressured indicates that the author's actions were contributing to a negative environment. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because concerts can be lively, but they did ignore direct requests from others to sit, which affects their experience. So, it's a balance between personal enjoyment and respecting others' rights to an unobstructed view.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is partially at fault. They should have considered the people behind them more and perhaps found a middle ground. Answer A (Yes) because they were inconsiderate by not respecting the requests to sit down, even if the concert was lively.\n"
