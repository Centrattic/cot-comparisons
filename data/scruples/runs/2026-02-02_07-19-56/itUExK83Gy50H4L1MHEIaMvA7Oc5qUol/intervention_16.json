It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) story.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was at an Elton John concert in a floor section with chairs on risers. They started standing when people in front stood up, which caused the people behind them (an older couple and others) to ask them to sit. The author tried to accommodate once but then refused later, leading to some conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about concert etiquette and mutual respect. Concerts can vary in their atmosphere. Some are seated but people might stand, especially for songs they know. However, blocking the view of others is generally frowned upon. The author mentions that they were in the back, so standing might have blocked the view of the older couple behind them. When the older couple asked them to sit, the author complied once but then decided not to, leading to tension.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The user thinks so. I need to consider both sides. The author argues that it's an Elton John concert, people were dancing, and they wanted to participate. But the older couple was clearly uncomfortable and felt their view was blocked. The author's actions caused frustration, leading to sarcastic clapping and a dirty look. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, when someone's view is blocked, it's customary to sit down if possible, especially in seated sections. The fact that others in front were standing might have made it harder for the author's group to see initially, but once they stood, the people behind were affected. The author's refusal to sit when asked could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the young couple behind apologized later suggests that the pressure from the older couple was significant, and maybe the author's group was part of the problem by not cooperating enough.\n\nHowever, the author did try to sit once, which shows some consideration. But when they refused later, it escalated the situation. The key issue is whether the author should prioritize their own enjoyment over others' ability to see the concert. Concerts often have a balance between personal enjoyment and respecting others' experience. Since standing was causing a problem for those behind, the author's choice to stand repeatedly might be inconsiderate, hence in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
