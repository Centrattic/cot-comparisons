It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong at an Elton John concert by standing up despite people behind them asking them to sit down. The author's side is that they wanted to enjoy the music by standing during upbeat songs, and they felt it was reasonable since others were doing the same. The people behind them, an older couple and others, were presumably seated and wanted them to sit to see the stage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. In seated concerts, especially where people are in elevated rows, it's common for people in the front to stand and dance, which can block the view for those behind. The key point here is whether the author's standing was causing a problem for others. The older couple and their neighbors were asking the author to sit down, which suggests their view was being obstructed. The author did sit down during slower songs but stood again during upbeat ones, leading to continued complaints.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's an Elton John concert and others were standing. However, the seating arrangement might mean that standing is not the norm, and the presence of chairs could imply that the venue expects seated attendees. The author might be contributing to a cumulative blocking effect, even if others are also standing. \n\nAnother factor is the escalation of the situation. The older couple got angry and started sarcastic clapping, and the author responded with a dirty look. This kind of confrontation can create a hostile environment. While the author felt their actions were justified, the impact on others is significant. \n\nConcert etiquette often prioritizes the view for all attendees. If standing is allowed, there should be a way to do so without blocking others. The author might have ignored the needs of those behind them, even after being asked multiple times. The fact that the young couple behind them later apologized suggests that the author's actions were causing pressure on others.\n\nSo, while the author was trying to enjoy the concert, their actions directly affected the experience of others. There's a balance between personal enjoyment and respecting the rights of others. The author's repeated refusal to sit down, despite being asked, could be seen as inconsiderate. They might have been in the wrong because they didn't fully respect the seating arrangement's purpose and the needs of those seated behind them.\n"
