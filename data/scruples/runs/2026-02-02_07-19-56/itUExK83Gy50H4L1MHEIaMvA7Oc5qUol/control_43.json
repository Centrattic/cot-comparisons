It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite others telling them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The concert was Elton John at Madison Square Garden, with floor seats on risers. The couple stood up during performances, which blocked the view for people behind them. The people behind, especially an older couple and others, asked them to sit down. The couple complied during a slower song but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" ignoring the requests. They ended up getting angry and sarcastic claps from the audience, and the couple responded with a dirty look.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about blocking the view. Concert etiquette usually implies that if your actions (like standing) obstruct others, you should consider their needs. The couple's defense is that everyone else was standing, so they felt it was okay. But the people behind were specifically affected because they were in the back rows on risers, which might make the view obstruction more significant.\n\nThe key points to consider: \n1. The couple was aware of the problem (they tried to ask others in front to sit down) but then ignored repeated requests from the people behind. \n2. Their argument that everyone stood up is a common one, but if their position made their standing a problem for others, they should take responsibility. \n3. The fact that even a young couple felt pressured to ask them again suggests that the couple wasn't considering the people behind's discomfort. \n4. The older couple's frustration escalated to yelling and sarcastic claps, which is a negative outcome the authors contributed to by not cooperating.\n\nOn the other hand, the concert wasn't a standing event, so using chairs might imply that sitting is the norm. However, if the venue allows standing, especially during popular songs, there's a social expectation to do so. But when someone's actions block others, the etiquette shifts towards being considerate.\n\nIn many concerts, especially seated ones, it's expected to not stand for extended periods because it blocks others. The couple's choice to stand despite being asked shows a lack of consideration. They also took it further by responding with a dirty look, which is disrespectful.\n\nSo, the author's actions led to conflict and made others uncomfortable. Even though they had a right to enjoy the concert, they didn't account for the impact on others. Therefore, they might be at fault.\n"
