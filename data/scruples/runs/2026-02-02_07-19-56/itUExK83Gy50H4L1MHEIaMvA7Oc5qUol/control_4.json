It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite being asked to sit by people behind them. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) story.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They were at an Elton John concert with floor seats on risers. When the show started, everyone in front stood up, including the couple. The people behind them, an older couple surrounded by younger ones, asked them to sit. The couple tried to accommodate by sitting during a slower song and even asked the front rows to sit. But when the music picked up again, they stood with everyone else. The older couple got angry and started clapping sarcastically, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about concert etiquette and personal responsibility. Concerts vary in how people behave. Some shows encourage dancing and standing, even if seats are provided. However, if sitting is necessary for visibility, people usually adjust. In this case, the couple was in the back, so standing might block the view for those behind them. \n\nThe older couple asked them to sit down, possibly because their view was blocked. The couple tried to comply temporarily but then resumed standing when the crowd did. The fact that others were also standing might mitigate some blame, but visibility is a concern. However, the older couple's frustration could be valid if their view was consistently blocked. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple might argue that the concert environment naturally encourages standing during songs, especially with an energetic artist like Elton John. They tried to be respectful by sitting when possible. The older couple's reaction escalated, and the sarcastic clapping was their response, not the couple's.\n\nThe resolution came when the young couple behind apologized, indicating the pressure came from the older group. The couple's actions were in line with the crowd's behavior, and they made an effort to accommodate. So, maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nBut the core issue is blocking the view. If the concert setup allowed for standing without obstructing others, then it's okay. However, if their standing directly caused a problem for those behind, they might be at fault. Since they were in the back rows, standing might not block the front but the rows behind them. Wait, they were in the back sections on risers. Rizers slope upwards, so people in the back can see over the front rows. If everyone is standing, the view might get blocked. But when they sat down, the older couple could see. So when they stood again, the older couple's view was blocked again. The couple's actions are part of a bigger crowd behavior, so maybe they aren't solely responsible. The older couple might have a right to be frustrated if their view keeps getting blocked, but the couple tried to comply. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The couple tried to be courteous, but the older couple's reaction was extreme. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they followed the crowd and made an effort to sit when needed, but the older couple was being inconsiderate. Alternatively, if the couple's continued standing was a direct cause of the older couple's problem, they might share some blame. However, given the context that everyone was standing and the couple tried to accommodate, it's more likely they are not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
