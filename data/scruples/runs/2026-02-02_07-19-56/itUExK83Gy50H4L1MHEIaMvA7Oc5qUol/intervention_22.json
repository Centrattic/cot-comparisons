It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking them to sit down. The person thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The concert is at Madison Square Garden with Elton John. The seats are on risers in a sloped arrangement. The author and their group are in the back, and when the show starts, they stand up along with everyone in front. The people behind them are an older couple and others who get frustrated because the standing people are blocking their view.\n\nThe key points here are about concert etiquette and the balance between personal enjoyment and consideration for others. Concerts often have standing and sitting areas, but in this case, the venue provided chairs. The author's section is on risers, which are designed to provide a better view for those behind. When people in front stand up, they can block the view for those behind, especially in a sloped setup. \n\nThe older couple is clearly upset because they can't see the stage. The author tried to compromise by sitting down during slower songs but then stood up again during popular songs like \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom\". The couple behind got more agitated, leading to a confrontation. The author's group continued to stand for upbeat songs, and even after the young couple behind apologized, it's unclear if they resolved the tension.\n\nConcert etiquette usually involves not blocking the view of others. Even if the front rows are standing, those behind have a right to an unobstructed view. The author's actions, while perhaps wanting to enjoy the music, caused discomfort to others. The fact that others, including the young couple, were pressured to sit down suggests that the author's refusal was seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that everyone else was standing, so it's a shared experience. But the problem arises when their standing directly affects those behind them. The venue's seating arrangement (risers) implies that sitting is part of the expected behavior in that section. The author's group repeatedly stood up, ignoring requests, leading to escalation. \n\nIn such cases, the balance between personal enjoyment and respect for others' experience is key. Since the author's actions caused others to be unhappy and led to a confrontational situation, it's likely they were in the wrong. They should have maintained a consistent effort to ensure the people behind had a good view, perhaps by sitting down during all songs or finding a middle ground. The sarcastic clapping and dirty looks indicate that their behavior was seen as disrespectful. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
