It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is at fault for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the concert was at Madison Square Garden, so it's a large venue. They were seated in the back on risers. When the show started, people in front stood up, and they joined in. The people behind them were an older couple, maybe less mobile, who kept asking them to sit down so they could see. The author tried to accommodate by sitting during a slower song, but during a more upbeat song like \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood again. The older couple got angry, and there was some tension. Eventually, the young couple behind apologized, saying they felt pressured by the older ones.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that it's an Elton John concert where people generally stand up during songs, and they were just joining in. They feel it's their right to stand if everyone else is doing it. The couple behind them, being older, might need to see over others to enjoy the concert.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consideration for others' views. In a seated concert, especially in a sloped setup, taller people in front can block the view for those behind. If the author is standing, they're contributing to that blockage. The older couple is presumably more likely to need the elevated view. The fact that the author tried to sit during a slower song shows they tried to be respectful, but then chose to stand again during another upbeat song, even when asked again. The dirty look they gave might be a reaction to being yelled at, but that could add to the tension.\n\nOn the other hand, concerts often have a culture where people stand during certain songs, and the author might feel they're just participating in the enjoyment of the music. However, the older couple's request is about their ability to see the stage. There's a balance between personal enjoyment and consideration for others. The author might argue that it's a free choice, but in a space where seating is arranged with a view in mind, there's an expectation to respect the sightlines. The fact that they were in the back rows, the older couple in front, but actually the author was in front of the older couple? Wait, the author says they were in the back sections, and the people behind them were the older couple. Wait, the setup is risers, so maybe the author's row is higher up? Wait, the description says \"we were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\" So, the risers slope upwards, so the back rows are higher. If they're in the back, they might be sitting higher, but people behind them would be the rows in front? Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe author is in a back section of the floor seats on risers. The risers create a sloped seating, so the front rows are lower, and the back rows are higher. The people behind them are the older couple. Wait, if the author is in the back, then the people behind them would be rows beyond them, which aren't possible if they're in the back. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the seating is arranged such that the stage is in front, and the audience is in rows facing it. The author is in a back section, meaning further away from the stage. The people behind them would be in rows behind the author's row, which again, if it's sloped, their row is higher. So, if the author stands up, they block the view for the people behind them. But if the author is in the back, the people behind them would be the rows behind, which would be less of an issue in terms of blocking the view, unless the author's row is the highest. Wait, maybe the risers slope upwards from the stage towards the back. So the front rows are lower, and the back rows are higher. So if the author is in the back, standing up would block the people behind them (who are in an even higher row?) No, if the author is in the back, there's no rows behind them. Maybe the older couple is in front of the author? Wait, the original post says: \"the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down.\" Wait, that can't be. If the author is in the back section, the people behind them would be in rows behind, but if they're in the very back, there's no rows behind. Maybe there's a miscommunication here. Perhaps the author is in a middle section, not the very back. Maybe \"back sections\" refers to towards the back of the venue but not the absolute end. So, the author is in a row where people are sitting behind them (towards the rear of the venue). If they stand up, they block the view for those behind. So, the older couple is sitting behind the author's row. Therefore, when the author stands up, they block the older couple's view. The author is in a front row relative to the older couple. So, the author's actions affect the older couple's ability to see the stage. In that case, the author is blocking the view of the people behind them, and the older couple is asking them to sit down to maintain sightlines. \n\nIn that case, the author's choice to stand during certain songs, despite being asked to sit, is blocking the view for others. The author's defense is that everyone else is standing, but if the venue is designed for seated viewing, then standing might be considered against the intended setup. Concerts sometimes have standing areas and seated areas. If this was a seated section, the expectation is to remain seated, and if people choose to stand, they are responsible for not obstructing others. The author's actions, while perhaps in line with the crowd's behavior, are causing discomfort to others. \n\nThe fact that the author tried to accommodate by sitting during a slower song shows they were aware of the issue, but then chose to stand again during another song. The older couple's frustration escalates as the author ignores their requests. The author's response to the situation, giving a dirty look, might be seen as confrontational. \n\nIn terms of social norms and etiquette, when attending a concert, especially seated, one should be mindful not to block others' views. There's a balance between personal enjoyment and consideration for others. The author might argue that it's part of the concert experience to stand and dance, but the older couple's request is about their ability to enjoy the concert. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they are blocking the view of others who have the right to see the stage. Their choice to stand despite being asked to sit down is selfish and inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
