It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking them to sit down. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The concert was Elton John at Madison Square Garden. They were in the floor seats on risers. When the show started, people in front stood up, so they did too. The people behind, an older couple and others, asked them to sit. They complied during a slower song but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer.\" The older couple got angry, and sarcastic clapping happened. The author argues that since everyone else was standing, they should be allowed to too.\n\nSo, the main issue is blocking the view for the people behind. Theaters and concerts often have rules about not standing in seated areas to avoid obstructing others. If the venue provided seats, standing up could be against the rules. The author's defense is that others were doing the same, but that might not absolve them if the venue's policy is about seated sections. \n\nAlso, the older couple's frustration suggests they were in a seated area where standing isn't allowed. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting their need to see the stage. Even if others are doing it, it's still considerate to sit down when asked. The author did sit during slower songs but then stood again. The fact that the young couple later apologized indicates that the older couple's group was pressuring them, which might not make the author right, but it shows others felt the pressure too.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should consider the venue's rules and the comfort of those behind. The key points are: 1) Was it a seated section? 2) Did the venue allow standing? 3) Was the author's action a breach of general etiquette? \n\nIf it's a seated section, then standing is generally not allowed, making the author wrong. But if it's a standing area, maybe not. However, the fact that the people in front were standing might mean they were in a mixed setup. Also, the author did attempt to sit when possible but chose to stand again during songs they wanted to enjoy. \n\nBalancing the rights of all attendees is important. The author's actions affected others' experience. Even if it's a lively concert, obstructing the view is inconsiderate. So, likely, the author is in the wrong (A), but there's nuance because others were doing the same. However, the right answer is probably A because they should prioritize the people behind them.\n"
