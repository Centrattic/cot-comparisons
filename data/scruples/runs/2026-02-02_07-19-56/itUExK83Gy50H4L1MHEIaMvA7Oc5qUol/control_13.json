It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The scenario is an Elton John concert where the main character (the author) is in the back rows of the floor seats, which are on risers. When the concert starts, people in front stand up, so they join in. The people behind them, an older couple surrounded by younger couples, ask them to sit down. The author tries to be respectful and sits during a slower song, but then during an upbeat song like \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stand again, leading to more complaints. Eventually, the older couple gets angry, and the author gives them a dirty look. The author's defense is that it's an Elton John concert, where people generally stand to dance, and they feel entitled to do so.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key factors here are blocking the view for those behind them and the social norms of concerts. In many concerts, especially for certain genres, standing up is expected. However, if being seated is necessary for the people behind to see the stage, there's a responsibility to sit down when asked. The author was in a back section on risers, which might mean their standing could block the view for others. They tried to mediate by getting the front rows to sit, but when they stood again during an upbeat song, the older couple was upset. The author's actions led to others being uncomfortable and the older couple feeling frustrated. They also ended up clapping sarcastically and the author gave a dirty look, escalating the situation.\n\nFrom a social responsibility angle, even if the author believes it's a dance-heavy concert, they should consider the people behind them. The fact that they were on risers suggests that their standing could obstruct the view, which is a common issue in concerts. The author's refusal to sit despite requests shows a lack of consideration. However, the social expectation of the event might justify their actions. The older couple's frustration is understandable if they can't see the stage. The author's response of ignoring and giving a dirty look is unhelpful, but the initial decision to stand might be seen as normal for the event.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author might be at fault for not fully considering the people behind them, even if standing is typical. The resolution was that the young couple apologized, suggesting that the main issue was the pressure from the older couple. But the author's actions did cause discomfort. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't adequately address the requests to sit down to prevent blocking others, leading to conflict.\n"
