It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The situation is from an AITA post where they attended an Elton John concert. They were in the back rows on risers. When the show started, people in front stood up, so they joined. The people behind, an older couple, asked them to sit. They did sit during a slower song, but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and other songs. The older couple got angry and there was some clapping and a dirty look. Now the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are about concert etiquette, respecting others' views, and personal enjoyment. The author argues that everyone else was standing, so they should have the same right. However, the people behind them couldn't see the stage because they were standing. The author tried to mediate by getting the front rows to sit, but then they resumed standing. The older couple was clearly frustrated, and the author's actions led to an uncomfortable situation where others felt pressured.\n\nConcert etiquette often involves balancing personal enjoyment with consideration for others. Even if many people are standing, if you're blocking the view of those behind, you're being inconsiderate. The author's defense is that it's an energetic performance and people are jamming, but they also had chairs provided, which implies seated seating. Choosing to stand when it blocks others might be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that they ignored the older couple's requests and even got a young couple to mediate on their behalf suggests they prioritized their own enjoyment over the comfort of others. The sarcastic clapping and dirty look from the author indicate a lack of respect for the older couple's frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it's a lively concert and they're entitled to enjoy it. But concert venues usually have designated areas for standing (like floor pits) and seated sections. If they were in a seated section, standing up repeatedly is problematic. The author's actions disrupted others, and while they tried to mitigate by getting others to sit, they didn't fully address the issue. The key issue is whether they respected others' right to an unobstructed view. Since they were in a seated area, standing up repeatedly without considering the people behind them is likely inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
