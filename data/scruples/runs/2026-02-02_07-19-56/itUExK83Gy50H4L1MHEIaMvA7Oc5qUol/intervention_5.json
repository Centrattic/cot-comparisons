It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) was in the wrong for standing up at a concert when people behind them asked them to sit down.\n\nFirst, the context: they were at an Elton John concert with floor seats on risers. When the music started, people in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind, an older couple, asked them to sit. They complied during a slower song but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer.\" The older couple got angry, and sarcasm ensued. The author argues that since everyone else was standing, they should be allowed to too.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to decide if it's A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nPoints to consider: Concert etiquette varies. In some concerts, especially with floor seating, standing is common for energetic songs. However, the author was seated in a riser section. If the author's standing blocks people behind, that's an issue. The older couple couldn't see the stage because of the standing crowd, so they asked to sit. The author initially tried to accommodate but then refused later. The key issue is whether standing is acceptable if it obstructs others' view.\n\nThe author's argument is about personal choice and following the crowd. However, if their actions directly impact others' ability to enjoy the concert, they might be in the wrong. The fact that even the young couple behind them apologized suggests that the majority was uncomfortable with the author's refusal to sit.\n\nBut Elton John concerts often have dancing and movement. The author mentions it's not a pit, but still, people stand. However, seating is provided, so maybe standing is optional. The problem arises when their standing blocks others. The author tried to mediate initially by asking others to sit, but then continued to stand when others did. If the author's actions caused obstruction, they might be at fault. But if the venue's setup allows for standing without blocking, maybe not.\n\nThe older couple's frustration is valid if they can't see. The author's refusal to sit despite being asked could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if others are standing, if the author's section is higher and their standing blocks the view, that's a problem. The author might argue it's about concert culture, but if their actions directly caused the issue, they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, balancing personal choice vs. others' enjoyment. The older couple's need to see the stage vs. the author's desire to dance. Since the author's standing was the cause of the obstruction, even if others were doing the same, they might be in the wrong for not respecting the request to sit when it's affecting others.\n"
