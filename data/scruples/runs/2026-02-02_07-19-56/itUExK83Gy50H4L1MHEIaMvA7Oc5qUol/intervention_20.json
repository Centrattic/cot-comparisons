It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite being asked to sit down by people behind them.\n\nFirst, the situation: They attended an Elton John concert in a seated floor section. During the show, they stood up when others around them did. People two rows behind, an older couple and others, asked them to sit so they could see. The author complied initially but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer.\" The older couple got angry, people clapped sarcastically, and the author gave a dirty look. The young couple behind apologized later.\n\nThe key points here are about consideration for others. Concerts typically have seated sections to ensure everyone has a good view. Standing in a seated area can block the view for those behind, which is a common courtesy issue. Even if others are standing, the author's actions directly affected the older couple's ability to see. The author's defense is that everyone else is doing it, but that doesn't mitigate the effect on those behind. The fact that the young couple felt pressured by the older ones and later apologized suggests that the author's standing was causing a problem. The author's refusal to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom\" despite being asked again shows a lack of responsiveness. The sarcastic clapping and dirty look indicate a conflict escalation. So, while wanting to enjoy the concert is understandable, the author should have prioritized respecting the seating arrangement and the needs of those behind them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not consistently following the request to sit and causing discomfort to others.\n"
