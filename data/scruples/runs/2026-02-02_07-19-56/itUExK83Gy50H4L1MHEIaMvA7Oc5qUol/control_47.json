It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a concert where the author stood up during songs, and people behind them kept asking them to sit down. The author is arguing that everyone else was standing, so they should be allowed to as well.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around concerts. Typically, in a seated concert, people might expect to stay seated unless there's a specific area for standing, like a pit. The author was in a seated section with chairs, but others were standing. The problem arises because the people behind couldn't see the stage, so they were asking the author to sit down to avoid blocking their view.\n\nThe author's defense is that everyone else was standing, so they should have the same right. But the key point is that the people behind them had a legitimate issue with visibility. Even if others are standing, if your actions prevent others from seeing the show, that could be considered inconsiderate. The author did sit down when possible, but then stood again during another song, leading to more conflict.\n\nThe older couple got angry and others sarcastically clapped, which escalated the situation. The author's response was to ignore them, leading to a confrontation. The young couple behind them later apologized, indicating that the author wasn't the only one at fault, but the older couple might have been pushy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have points. The author wanted to enjoy the concert by standing, which is common in some settings, but they might have overlooked the people behind them. The people behind had a right to an unobstructed view. The author's decision to stand up repeatedly despite being asked could be seen as inconsiderate, especially when it's affecting others' experience.\n\nHowever, concerts can be lively, and sometimes it's expected to stand. But the author was in a seated section, so maybe there's an expectation to stay seated unless there's a pit. The fact that the author tried to sit down during a slower song but then stood again when the music was upbeat shows they tried to compromise.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author might be partially at fault for not fully considering the people behind them, but the other side also might have been aggressive in their demands. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the people behind had a valid reason (not being able to see), the author's repeated refusal despite being asked could make them at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong. But wait, in concerts, it's often a shared responsibility. Maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they did contribute to the problem. Hmm. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In some concerts, standing is expected even in seated areas. But the key is that the people behind couldn't see. So, the author's actions, while possibly common, were causing a problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
