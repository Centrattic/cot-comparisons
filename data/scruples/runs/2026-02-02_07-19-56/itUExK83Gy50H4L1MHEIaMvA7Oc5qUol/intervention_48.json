It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite being asked to sit by people behind them.\n\nFirst, the situation: they were at an Elton John concert, in the floor seats on risers. When the music started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. The older couple behind got upset because they couldn't see over the standing crowd and asked them to sit. The author initially sat down during a slower song but then stood again during a fast song, leading to more complaints and tension.\n\nThe key points here are about social etiquette and respect for others' experience. Concerts often have varying expectations. Floor seats usually mean you can stand or sit, but if someone is sitting behind you and can't see, it's courteous to consider their view. The author did sit down once when asked, which was good, but then continued standing despite repeated requests. The older couple was clearly frustrated because they couldn't enjoy the concert due to the standing crowd. The author's argument is that everyone else was standing, but the issue is that the people behind them were affected. \n\nThe author might not be entirely wrong, but repeatedly ignoring requests after being asked could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the people behind eventually felt pressured to comply might indicate a group dynamic issue. However, the author's right to enjoy the concert is also valid. \n\nIn social situations, balancing personal enjoyment with others' comfort is key. Since the author was aware of the problem and chose to ignore it after the first time, it's possible they were inconsiderate. But the concert setting and the collective behavior of others might mitigate some blame. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for not respecting the requests, especially after the older couple got increasingly upset. Standing up is part of the concert experience, but so is ensuring others can see. The author should have made a more sustained effort to accommodate both. So, Answer A.\n"
