It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author and others are at an Elton John concert. They're in the back sections on risers. When the show starts, everyone in front stands up, so they join. The people behind (an older couple and others) ask them to sit down. The author complies during a slow song but then stands again during a popular song, leading to conflict. The older couple gets angry, others clap sarcastically. Eventually, the younger couple apologizes.\n\nThe key points here are about concert etiquette and personal boundaries. The author argues that if everyone else is standing, they should be allowed to too. However, the people behind them, especially the older couple, are presumably trying to have a good view and are being obstructed by the standing crowd.\n\nIn concerts with seating, especially on risers, the expectation might be that you stay seated to maintain sightlines. If the author and others stand up, they block the view for those behind. Even if others are doing it, it doesn't necessarily make it right. The couple behind them might have specific needs, like being older and needing to see the stage clearly.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's a concert where people naturally want to dance, but the organizers provided chairs. So there's a conflict between personal enjoyment and respecting others' experience. The author did try to sit during a slow song but then stood again. The fact that the older couple yelled and were frustrated suggests that their request was legitimate. The author's refusal after being asked multiple times could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author might feel it's a common experience at concerts to stand and dance, especially for popular songs. The key is whether the author's actions were unreasonable given the setup. Since they were in a seated section, standing might be against the venue's rules or the intended seating arrangement. If the venue expected people to sit, then the author was in the wrong by not following that, even if others did it too. \n\nAlso, the fact that after the first incident, the author complied once, but then ignored further requests, leading to escalation, shows a pattern of disregarding others' requests once they felt entitled to stand. The sarcastic clapping and the younger couple's apology later indicate that the author's actions were disruptive, even if they weren't alone in it.\n\nSo, considering concert etiquette and respecting others' views, the author might be in the wrong. Even if others were doing it, they should have respected the couple's requests to sit. The answer is A.\n"
