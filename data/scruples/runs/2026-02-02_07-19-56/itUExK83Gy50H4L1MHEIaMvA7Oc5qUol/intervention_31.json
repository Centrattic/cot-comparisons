It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when others behind them asked them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was at an Elton John concert with seats on the floor. They were in the back rows, and when the show started, people in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind them, an older couple with younger couples around, asked them to sit down. The author tried to be respectful by sitting during a slower song and even asked the people in front to sit down. But during an upbeat song, they stood again, leading to frustration from the older couple who eventually got angry and others clapped sarcastically. The author felt that since everyone else was standing, they should be allowed to too.\n\nSo the main question is whether standing up in this scenario is the right or wrong thing to do. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're curious about other perspectives.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, concerts can be about enjoying the music, and if everyone is standing, it's natural to join in. Especially since the venue provided chairs but people are choosing to stand. However, the people behind the author were trying to watch the show and couldn't because those in front stood up. The author's actions might have blocked the view for others, which is a common issue in concerts. The author did sit down during a slower song, which shows some consideration, but then resumed standing during an upbeat song. The older couple's frustration is understandable if their view was obstructed repeatedly.\n\nBut then, the author also points out that it's an Elton John concert, which might have a more casual atmosphere where people stand up even if there are seats. Plus, the concert's setup with risers suggests that sightlines are considered, but maybe not perfectly. The people behind might have had a legitimate grievance, but the author's refusal to sit down when asked could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author isn't the only one standing; the people in front are also up, which complicates things. It's possible that the real issue is the venue's seating arrangement not accommodating for standing during performances.\n\nAnother angle: the people behind could have chosen to move or sit in a different section. But maybe they couldn't. The author's response of ignoring the requests might have escalated the situation. The older couple's reaction (yelling, sarcastic clapping) was harsh, but their frustration came from the repeated issue. The author's dirty look might have been a poor choice, but the main question is about standing up.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes concerts allow for some movement, especially with classic rock artists. However, if the venue provided seating, there's an expectation that people will use it to maintain views. The author's actions disrupted that. Even if others were standing, if the author's section is blocking the view for others behind, they might be at fault. The fact that the author tried to sit once but then stood again during a popular song suggests they prioritized their own enjoyment over the comfort of others. The young couple behind them mediating shows that the author wasn't entirely wrong, but the initial refusal to sit when asked could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, balancing all that, I think the author is in the wrong because their actions directly affected others' ability to enjoy the concert. Even though they tried to compromise, the repeated standing during key songs and ignoring the requests might make them the asshole. But there's also the argument that the venue's setup or the concert's nature contributed. However, the AITA format usually looks at individual responsibility. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
