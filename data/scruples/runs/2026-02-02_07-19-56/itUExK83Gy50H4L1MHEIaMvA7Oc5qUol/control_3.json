It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for standing up at a concert while people behind them asked them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The concert was Elton John at Madison Square Garden. The author was in the back rows of the floor seats on risers. When the show started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. But the people behind started asking them to sit down, which they eventually did during a slow song. Then, during \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood again with the crowd, and the people behind got upset. The older couple got angry, the young couple felt pressured, and there was some sarcastic clapping and a dirty look from the author.\n\nThe key points here are about blocking the view for people behind. The author is defending their right to stand when everyone else is doing it, but the people behind them are clearly being obstructed. The question is whether the author was wrong for not sitting down despite the requests.\n\nI need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, if someone's view is blocked, it's polite to sit down or adjust so that others behind can see. However, in many concerts, especially with standing crowds, there's an understanding that people might stand for certain songs. But in this case, the author was in a seated section, so maybe they had a responsibility to sit to allow the audience behind a clear view.\n\nThe fact that the older couple was surrounded by younger couples might indicate that the seating was tiered, so blocking their view is a valid concern. The author chose to stand even after being asked, which caused frustration. The young couple behind them mediated, but the author refused, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that it's a concert where people naturally stand, and they weren't in a mosh pit. But the problem is about the physical obstruction. Even if it's a concert where standing is common, if someone is sitting and their view is blocked, the people in front should sit down to respect their right to see the performance.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they prioritized their own enjoyment over others' ability to see the show. Even if the author felt others should respect their choice to stand, the older couple's perspective is valid. The author could have compromised by sitting during songs where others needed to see, but they chose not to, leading to the confrontation.\n\nSo, considering concert etiquette and the impact on others, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the view of those behind them despite being asked. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
