It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at an Elton John concert. The author and their group are in the back sections of the floor seating, which has chairs on risers. They start standing up when the people in front do, which probably blocks the view for the people behind them. The older couple behind starts asking them to sit down, and the author initially complies during a slower song, but then when the music gets more upbeat again, they stand back up. The couple behind gets angry, and the author retaliates with a dirty look.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Concert venues often have certain expectations. Floor seats with chairs can sometimes be for people who prefer seating, especially if there's no standing area. If the venue provided chairs, maybe standing up is against the venue's rules or disrupts others. The key issue here is blocking the view of others. Even if everyone else is standing, if the author's standing up is blocking the view of those behind, it's considerate to sit down. The author did sit down initially when asked, but then stood again. That might be where the conflict arises.\n\nThe older couple seems to be the ones who are uncomfortable with the standing. The author argues that it's an Elton John concert and people are supposed to be dancing. But maybe the people behind them, especially the older couple, are there for the music and not the dancing, so the standing is more disruptive to them. The author's decision to stand despite being asked could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author did make an effort to sit during slower songs, which shows some consideration. But then choosing to stand again during a popular song might not be fair to those behind.\n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics. The author was part of a group where others were standing, so maybe they felt peer pressure to join in. However, the responsibility of not blocking others' views lies with the person whose actions are causing the blockage. Even if everyone else is standing, if the author's standing is directly affecting people behind them, the author should adjust their behavior.\n\nThe author's response to the older couple's requests by ignoring them and giving a dirty look might escalate the conflict unnecessarily. The older couple was just trying to enjoy the concert without obstruction. The author's actions could be seen as rude and dismissive of others' needs. \n\nOn the other hand, concerts often encourage audience participation, especially for a music icon like Elton John. The author might feel they have the right to enjoy the concert their way. However, the balance between personal enjoyment and respecting others' experience is crucial. If standing up is causing a problem for others, then the author should make an effort to accommodate both by sitting down more consistently.\n\nThe young couple behind later apologized, indicating that the pressure from the older couple was influencing them. This suggests that the older couple's actions were perhaps overstepping, but the author's refusal to comply might have been the initial catalyst. \n\nIn conclusion, while concerts are about enjoying music, the physical constraints of the venue matter. The author's decision to stand up despite being asked to sit down, even if others are doing the same, could be seen as inconsiderate because it directly affects the experience of those behind them. The author's actions might not be entirely wrong, but they are inconsiderate, so there's a case for them being in the wrong. However, the line between enjoying the concert and respecting others can be blurry here.\n"
