It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about standing up at an Elton John concert while people behind them keep asking them to sit down. The author explains that they were in the back rows, and when the concert started, everyone in front stood up, so they did too. The people behind, an older couple and others, asked them to sit so they could see the stage. The author complied during a slow song, but then during a more upbeat song like \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood up again, leading to more complaints and even some sarcastic clapping from the older couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Generally, in seated concerts, especially if you're in the back, it's polite to sit so that people behind you can see. However, if the crowd is standing and dancing, especially at a show by a performer like Elton John who's known for energetic performances, there's an argument that it's part of the experience. The author mentions that almost everyone else is standing, so maybe their action isn't entirely unreasonable. But the issue is that by standing, they're blocking the view for those behind them, even if the majority is standing. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to stand up despite being asked to sit? Was the author's refusal to sit during certain songs inconsiderate? The older couple's frustration is understandable because they can't see the stage. The author tried to mediate by asking the front rows to sit, but when the songs became upbeat again, they stood up again. The fact that the young couple behind them later apologized suggests that the older couple's pressure was perhaps a bit excessive, but the author's refusal to sit might have been the initial problem.\n\nAnother angle is the venue's setup. If the concert is set up with chairs, especially in a sloped arrangement, maybe the expectation is to stay seated. However, if the majority of the audience is standing, the venue might not enforce that. The author's defense is that everyone else is doing it, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility if their actions affect others. \n\nAlso, the author's response to the older couple's frustration by giving a dirty look might have escalated things, but the core issue is whether standing was inconsiderate. \n\nSo, in summary, the author might be in the wrong because even if others are standing, if they are blocking the view of people behind them, they should consider sitting to avoid being a hindrance. However, if the concert culture is one where standing is the norm, the author's actions could be seen as acceptable. The answer might hinge on balancing individual enjoyment versus consideration for others.\n"
