It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is at fault for standing up at the concert when people behind them asked them to sit down. The situation is at an Elton John concert where the author and others are standing during songs while an older couple behind them is upset.\n\nFirst, the author was in a seated floor section. When the concert started, the people in front stood, so they joined. The couple behind them, an older couple, asked them to sit down. The author then tried to be respectful by sitting during a slower song but later stood again during popular songs like Tiny Dancer. The older couple got angry, and there was some tension.\n\nThe key points here are about concert behavior and respect for others. The author argues that even though there are chairs, when everyone else is standing, it's natural to join in. But the people behind them couldn't see the stage because the front rows were standing. That's a problem for the people behind. \n\nIn concerts, especially seated sections, it's usually expected that people stay seated or don't block others. Even if others are standing, if you're in a seated area, standing can block the view for people behind. The author was asked to sit down, which is a reasonable request to ensure everyone can see. Refusing might be inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author might have felt that in an energetic concert like Elton John's, it's acceptable to stand. But the issue is about balancing personal enjoyment with not hindering others. The fact that the author tried to sit down once but then resumed standing after a while shows some consideration but not enough. The older couple's frustration is understandable because they paid for a good view and were being blocked repeatedly. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's Elton John, and people jam, but the venue provided chairs, suggesting a seated expectation. Also, the couple behind was surrounded by younger couples, implying maybe there's a generational difference in concert behavior. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is in a position where their actions affected others. Even if the front rows were standing, the author's section is blocking those behind. The couple's request is valid because they can't see the stage. The author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the couple's reaction (yelling, sarcastic clapping) might have escalated the situation unfairly. \n\nBut ultimately, the author had the choice to sit when asked, to minimize blocking. Insisting on standing despite repeated requests is where the fault lies. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they prioritized their own enjoyment over the comfort and view of others, even after being asked multiple times.\n"
