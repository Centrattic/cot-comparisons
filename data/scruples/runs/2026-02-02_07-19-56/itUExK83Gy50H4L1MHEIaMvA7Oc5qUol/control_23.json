It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when people behind them kept asking to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The concert was for Elton John at Madison Square Garden. They were in the floor section on risers. When the concert started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined. People behind, an older couple and others, asked them to sit to see the stage. They complied during a slower song. Later, during a popular song like \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood again, leading to more complaints. They refused and got a dirty look. The people behind felt pressured and the young couple apologized.\n\nSo, the main issue is blocking the view. Concert etiquette usually involves not blocking others' views. Even if everyone is standing, if someone behind you can't see because you're blocking them, it's considered rude. The author acknowledges that they were in the back and when people stood, they blocked the older couple. They tried to sit during a slow song, which was respectful. However, when they stood again during another song, they ignored the requests again, leading to frustration.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Are you supposed to sit if you're blocking someone's view? 2) Did the author act respectfully? 3) Is there a cultural context (Elton John fans might expect standing for songs)? \n\nIn most concerts, especially seated sections, you're expected to stay seated unless there's a dance pit or it's clear everyone stands. Since this was a seated area with chairs, standing might be less expected. However, if the majority stands, maybe it's okay. But if you're blocking people behind, it's impolite. The author tried to sit once but then stood again, causing conflict. The older couple was upset, and others were sarcastic. The author's response was confrontational.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether the priority is on respecting others' view vs. enjoying the concert. Since the author was in a seated section, they might have a responsibility to sit to ensure those behind can see. Their refusal despite being asked multiple times could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the fact that everyone else was standing might be a mitigating factor.\n\nBut in general, concert etiquette suggests if your actions prevent someone else from enjoying the event (like blocking their view), you're in the wrong. The author knew they were blocking, tried once to comply, then disregarded the requests. So they might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
