It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert while people behind them asked them to sit down. The scenario involves an Elton John concert where the author and others stood during upbeat songs, causing an older couple behind them to get upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Concerts often have varying crowd behaviors. Some people prefer to stand and dance, others sit. The author was in a seated area but chose to stand during songs, which blocked the view for those behind. The key issue is blocking the view. Even though the venue provided chairs, the collective action of standing might be expected during lively songs.\n\nThe author tried to accommodate by sitting during slower songs, which shows some consideration. However, the older couple was frustrated because they couldn't see the stage. The author's refusal to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom\" despite requests might be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that others in front were also standing complicates it, but the main responsibility to not block the view lies with those in the back rows.\n\nThe sarcastic clapping and the author's dirty look escalate the situation. The author's argument is that others are standing too, so they should be allowed to as well. But the problem is that their standing does affect others' view. So, even if everyone is doing it, if it's causing a specific issue for someone behind, the ones in front might have a duty to sit to avoid blocking.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, did cause inconvenience. The correct approach might have been to sit down when asked, especially since they were in the back. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they prioritized their own enjoyment over others' ability to see the concert.\n"
