It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they were at an Elton John concert in a floor section with chairs on risers. They were in a back section, so seating was sloped. When the concert started, people in front stood up and they joined in. Then people behind them, specifically an older couple, asked them to sit down because they couldn't see the stage. The author tried to be respectful by sitting during a slower song and even asked others to sit down. But during a popular song like \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood again, and the older couple got angry and started yelling. The author then ignored them and even gave a dirty look when they clapped sarcastically. The young couple behind apologized for the pressure from others.\n\nSo the main issue is whether standing up during the concert, despite others asking to sit, was wrong. The author argues that everyone else was standing, so why shouldn't they? But the people behind couldn't see the stage because the rows in front were standing. \n\nIn concerts, especially seated sections, there's an expectation that people stay seated to allow others behind to see. If you're in a seated area, standing can block the view for those behind you. The author was in a back section, which suggests others behind them might be in higher rows, but if the seating is sloped, maybe they are lower. However, the problem arose when they stood up and blocked the older couple's view. \n\nThe author did make an effort to sit during slower songs, which shows some consideration. But during an upbeat song like \"Tiny Dancer,\" when everyone else is standing, they chose to stand again. This might be a common behavior at concerts, but if it's causing a blockage, it's a problem. The older couple was frustrated because they couldn't see, and the author's refusal to sit down during that time led to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. Seated concerts usually expect people to stay seated. 2. Standing can block the view. 3. The author was aware of the problem but continued to stand. 4. The response to the older couple's requests was defiant.\n\nWhile concerts can be lively, the expectation in seated sections is to remain seated. The author's actions, even if in line with others, disrupted the experience for those behind them. So, I think the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
