It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite being asked to sit down by people behind them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The concert was for Elton John, which isn't a typical dance-heavy event, but the venue had floor seats with chairs on risers. The author and their group stood up when others in front did, blocking the view for people behind. An older couple and others behind them repeatedly asked them to sit down. The author tried to accommodate once but then continued standing for upbeat songs, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about consideration for others' views. Concert etiquette often involves not standing if you block others' lines of sight. The venue provided chairs, which suggests they expect seated viewers for the best experience. Even if everyone else is standing, it's possible that the people behind have a right to an unobstructed view. The author's actions blocked the older couple's view despite their requests, which is a common etiquette issue in concerts.\n\nHowever, the author argues that it's an Elton John concert and people generally stand. They also mention that after the first request, they tried to adjust by making others in front sit as well. But when they refused later, especially during a popular song, the conflict escalated.\n\nThe older couple's frustration is valid because they paid for a good view and were being blocked. The sarcastic clapping and yelling from them indicate they felt disrespected. The author's response of giving a dirty look and ignoring their requests might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the majority of the audience is standing, the author might feel entitled to do the same. But the problem arises when their standing affects others. The question then is whether the author prioritized their own enjoyment over others' experience.\n\nIn typical concert etiquette, blocking the view is frowned upon, especially when others request you to sit. The fact that the venue provided chairs implies that standing isn't the norm, so the author might be at fault for not respecting others' need for a clear view. The couple behind them tried to mediate, but the author refused to adjust. Even if the music is lively, the key issue is respecting the seating arrangement and the rights of those behind to see the performance without obstruction.\n\nSo, considering the balance between personal enjoyment and respecting others' views, the author might be in the wrong. They didn't consistently comply with the requests and continued to block the view, leading to conflict. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
