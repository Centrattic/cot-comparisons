It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a concert where they stood up despite people behind them asking them to sit down. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The concert was at Madison Square Garden, a large venue. They were in the back section of the floor seats on risers. When the show started, people in front stood up and they joined in. The people behind, an older couple surrounded by younger couples, asked them to sit down. The author tried to be respectful by sitting during a slower song and even asked others to sit. But during a popular song like \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood again. The older couple got angry, and the author ended up ignoring them, leading to sarcastic clapping and a dirty look. The young couple behind apologized later.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's an Elton John concert where people usually stand for upbeat songs. The question is whether standing up despite being asked is wrong.\n\nSo, to evaluate, I should consider concert etiquette. In many concerts, especially for live music, standing is common, especially for popular songs. However, the issue here is blocking the view for those behind. The author was in the back, and when they stood, they blocked the older couple's view. Even though they tried to mediate by sitting during a slower song, they eventually stood again. The other people behind them felt their view was obstructed and asked to sit. The author's response was to ignore them and continue standing, leading to conflict.\n\nBut it's a balance between personal enjoyment and respecting others. The author might argue that the concert setup is for standing, but the people behind had a valid reason for needing a clear view. The author's actions caused frustration, and even though others around were standing, the specific request from the people behind was ignored. The fact that the young couple apologized suggests some pressure from the older couple.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's view wasn't blocked, but they blocked others. The concert setup might have expected standing, but being considerate to seated audience members behind is important. The author might have a point in wanting to enjoy the music, but they should have respected the requests. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
