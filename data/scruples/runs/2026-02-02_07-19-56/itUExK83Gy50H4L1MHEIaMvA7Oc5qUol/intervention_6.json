It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a concert where the author and others are standing up during songs, and people behind them (an older couple) are asking them to sit down. The author explains that the concert had chairs, but when everyone else stands, they join in. They tried to sit down once during a slower song but then stood up again for \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms of concerts. Typically, if the venue provides chairs, especially in a seated area, it's expected people stay seated unless the area is designed for standing. However, if most people are standing, maybe the seating is more flexible. But the key point is the people behind them were being obstructed. The author was blocking the view of the older couple. In such cases, concert etiquette usually suggests that the people whose view is obstructed have a right to ask others to sit down. \n\nThe author did initially sit down when asked but then ignored subsequent requests during popular songs. Standing up is a personal choice, but if your actions negatively impact others, it's a matter of consideration. The older couple's frustration is understandable because they can't see the concert. The author might argue that it's a concert and people dance, but the venue provided chairs, implying a seated arrangement. \n\nAlso, the fact that others in front and around the author were standing doesn't necessarily make it okay. The author's decision to stand up again after being asked might be seen as inconsiderate. The sarcastic clapping and dirty look from the author could have escalated the situation. \n\nHowever, the author did make an effort to sit during a slower song, showing some consideration. But then choosing to stand again despite repeated requests could be seen as prioritizing their own enjoyment over others' ability to see the show. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area, but generally, if you are blocking someone's view and they ask you to sit, refusing after the first time might be inconsiderate. The author's actions led to the older couple getting angry and the situation becoming uncomfortable. So, the author might be in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
