It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is at fault for standing up at a concert when the people behind them asked them to sit down. The situation involves a couple in the back (an older couple and their neighbors) who are upset because the person and the people in front are standing, blocking their view. The author stood up during songs, even when asked to sit, and eventually got into a confrontation where they shot a dirty look and were sarcastically clapped at.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is about respecting other attendees' view. Concerts often have different sections, and sometimes standing can block the view of those behind. The author was in a section with risers, which are designed to help with sightlines. However, they chose to stand during upbeat songs, which caused a problem for the people behind.\n\nThe author's defense is that everyone else was standing, so they should be allowed to do the same. But the problem arises because their standing was obstructing the view of the older couple. The fact that the older couple was surrounded by younger couples suggests there might be a generational divide in behavior. The author tried to mitigate by sitting during slower songs, but during the more popular song \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood again, leading to escalation.\n\nNow, the question is about right and wrong. In public events, there's an unspoken rule to be considerate of others' views. If you're in a higher row, you're expected to sit during songs where others in front are standing. The author was in a back section, so when they stand, they block those behind. The author's actions, while perhaps in line with the crowd's behavior, ignored the specific requests from the people directly behind them. Their refusal to sit, even when asked by the young couple (who were caught in the middle), might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's response to the older couple's frustration (dirty look, ignoring) further shows a lack of consideration. The sarcastic clapping from others indicates that the author's actions were seen as disruptive. While it's understandable to want to enjoy the concert, the key is balancing personal enjoyment with the rights of others to have an unobstructed view. The author might not be the sole person at fault\u2014others in front were standing too\u2014but their refusal to comply with requests and the resulting confrontation suggests they were in the wrong.\n"
