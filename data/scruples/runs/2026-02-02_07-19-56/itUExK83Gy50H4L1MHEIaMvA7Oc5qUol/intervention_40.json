It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The situation is at an Elton John concert where the author and others stood up during songs, leading to complaints from older people behind them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points are the concert setting, the seating arrangement with risers, the fact that the author was in a back section, and the conflict with the people behind. The author joined others in standing, even after being asked to sit down. The older couple got angry, and there was some sarcastic clapping and a dirty look from them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's more nuance. Concert etiquette varies. Some concerts encourage audience to stand and dance, especially for upbeat songs. Elton John's music might have a lot of such songs. However, the people behind the author were older and possibly wanted to see the stage better. The author tried to accommodate by sitting during slower songs but refused during others.\n\nI should consider the seating arrangement. Since they were on risers, standing might block the view for those behind. But if they were in the back, maybe the obstruction isn't as severe as front rows. Also, the author tried to mediate by getting the people in front to sit down. However, during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" they stood again despite the couple's requests.\n\nThe conflict escalated when the older couple started yelling, and the author gave a dirty look. The author's perspective is that it's their right to enjoy the concert, and others are being inconsiderate. However, their actions affected the audience behind. While concerts can be lively, blocking the view is a valid concern. The author's refusal to comply with others' requests might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they tried to mitigate it some.\n\nBut then again, if the majority of the audience is standing, maybe it's part of the concert experience. The author might not be the only one causing obstruction. The couple behind might be overreacting. However, the author's choice to stand repeatedly despite requests could be seen as disrespectful to those who need to see the stage. The resolution where the young couple apologized suggests that the older couple were the ones pressuring others, but the author's refusal still contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's right to enjoy the concert vs. others' right to see the stage. The author tried to sit during slower songs but chose to stand during upbeat ones. In concerts, standing is often part of the experience, but if it's blocking others, there's a responsibility to consider their view. Since the author was in the back, maybe the obstruction is less critical compared to front rows. However, the fact that they kept standing after being asked multiple times shows a disregard for others' needs. So, they might be in the wrong.\n"
