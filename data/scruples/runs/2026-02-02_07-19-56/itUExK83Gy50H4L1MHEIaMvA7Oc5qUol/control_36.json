It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when others behind them were asking them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The concert was for Elton John at Madison Square Garden. They were in the floor seats, which are on risers. Initially, people in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind (an older couple and others) asked them to sit down so they could see the stage. They tried to sit during a slow song but stood again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom\" when others were up. The older couple got angry, and there was some sarcasm and a dirty look from the author. The young couple later apologized, feeling pressured.\n\nThe key points here are about concert etiquette, visibility, and respect for others. The author's defense is that it's an Elton John concert and many people are standing. However, the people behind them had a legitimate issue with not being able to see the stage because those in front were standing. \n\nIn such situations, concert etiquette often suggests that if you're in a seated area, you should consider the people behind you. Standing up can block their view, especially in a sloped seating arrangement where each row is elevated. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if others were doing the same. However, if the majority were standing, maybe it's a common practice there. \n\nBut the main issue is that despite being asked to sit, the author continued to stand, leading to conflict. The older couple's frustration is understandable because their view was blocked. The author's refusal and the subsequent sarcastic clapping and dirty look could be seen as aggressive or dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were in a standing-friendly environment and that others nearby were also standing. The young couple even apologized later, indicating that the pressure wasn't entirely the author's fault. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The author was asked to sit and chose not to, which could be seen as disrespectful to the requests of those behind. Even if others were doing it, each individual has a responsibility to consider their neighbors. The author might be at fault for not fully accommodating the visibility issue once it was brought to their attention. \n\nHowever, the situation is a bit nuanced. If the concert is known for people standing, maybe it's more acceptable. But if the seating area is meant for sitting and the people behind are obstructed, then the author should have adjusted. The fact that they did sit during slower songs shows some consideration, but refusing to sit during the requested times could be seen as the wrong choice. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they chose to stand despite being asked to sit, which blocked the view and caused conflict. However, there's also the argument that the concert's culture allowed for standing. But since the people behind were asking specifically, the author should have prioritized their view, even if others were standing. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
