It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite others asking them to sit down. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) story.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were at an Elton John concert with floor seats on risers. When the show started, everyone in front stood up, so the author and their group joined in. The problem arises because people behind them, an older couple and others, asked them to sit down. The author tried to be respectful by sitting during a slower song but then continued standing during upbeat songs. The older couple got angry and sarcastic, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points here are about concert etiquette. In general, concerts have varying expectations. For seated shows, people might expect you to stay seated, but often people stand, especially for energetic songs. However, if someone's view is blocked, it's considerate to sit down. The author was in a back section, so standing might obstruct the view for those behind. \n\nThe author tried to compromise by sitting during a slow song but then resumed standing. The older couple's frustration is understandable because their view is being blocked repeatedly. However, the author argues that everyone else is standing, so they should be allowed to too. \n\nBut concert etiquette often considers the impact on others. If standing blocks the view, especially for those behind, it's polite to sit. The author's actions, while not malicious, could be seen as inconsiderate to the older couple despite the surrounding crowd's actions. However, the author also tried to mediate by getting others in front to sit down, which shows some consideration. \n\nThe final answer hinges on whether the author should prioritize their enjoyment over the comfort of others. Since the concert provided chairs, the expectation might lean towards seated behavior unless the venue is a standing area. The author's refusal to sit during certain songs, despite requests, might make them at fault. So, Answer A (author is in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
