It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is at an Elton John concert where they were sitting in the floor section. When the show started, everyone in front got up and started dancing, so the author and their friends joined in. But the people behind them, an older couple, kept asking them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, concerts are about enjoying the music, and people have different preferences. Some might prefer to sit, others to stand or dance. The problem here is that standing up might block the view for those sitting behind. Since the author was in a riser section, standing could indeed obstruct the view for the people behind. That's a key point.\n\nThe author tried to be respectful by sitting down during a slower song after the older couple asked. But then, during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" they stood up again, even after being asked. The older couple got angry, and there was some clapping and a dirty look. \n\nThe author's defense is that everyone else was standing, so why not them? But the issue is about the people behind them. Even if others are standing, if the author's standing blocks the view for those sitting behind, it's a problem. The concert organizers provided chairs, which suggests that sitting is expected, especially in that section. \n\nResponsibility here might lie in considering others' views. Even if others are doing the same, if the author's actions are causing a problem for those behind, they should find a balance. When the older couple asked them to sit, the author should have complied, especially after seeing the frustration. Refusing and getting defiant could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe fact that the young couple behind them apologized shows that the pressure from the older couple was affecting others too. The author's main issue might be not respecting the needs of the people behind them despite the crowd's actions. \n\nSo, considering concert etiquette and the impact on others, the author is in the wrong because they didn't maintain a clear view for those behind them even after being asked. So the answer would be A.\n"
