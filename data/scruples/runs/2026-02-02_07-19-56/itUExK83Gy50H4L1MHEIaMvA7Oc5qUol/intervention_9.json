It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were at an Elton John concert in a floor section with risers. When the music started, people in front stood, so they joined in. The people behind (an older couple and others) asked them to sit down. They initially complied during a slower song, but then when the music picked up again, they stood up again. The older couple got angry, and there was some confrontation.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, they were blocking the view for people behind them. Theaters and concerts often arrange seating so that each row is elevated to see over the one in front. If people in front stand up, those behind can't see. The author chose to stand when others were doing so, despite being asked to sit. They might be disregarding the rights of others to have an unobstructed view. Even if it's a concert where people expect to stand, the layout might have a purpose. The author's actions led to conflict, and the older couple got upset. The author might have acted selfishly by not considering the impact on others. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe concertgoers in floor sections expect to stand during performances. If everyone else is standing, it's reasonable to join in, especially if the venue allows for that. The author might argue that the seating was designed for standing during songs. However, the fact that the people behind had to ask suggests that the author's standing was causing a problem. The author could have adjusted their behavior more consistently, like sitting down during all songs or compromising. \n\nThe key point is about respecting others' view. Even if it's a concert where standing is common, the people behind have a right to see the stage. The author's decision to stand repeatedly despite being asked might be seen as inconsiderate. They did sit down once during a slower song, but then continued standing during other parts. The fact that the people behind were older and perhaps less able to stand could add to the issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not fully accommodating the needs of the audience behind them, even if standing is typical at such events. They could have found a middle ground or made more effort to ensure others weren't blocked. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
