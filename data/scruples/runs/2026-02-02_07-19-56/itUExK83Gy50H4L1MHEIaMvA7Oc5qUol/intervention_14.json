It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a concert where the author stood up during the show, causing people behind them to ask them to sit down. The author refused and even got into an argument with an older couple, ending up with sarcastic clapping and a dirty look.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about respect for others' views. When you're in a seated area, especially in a venue like Madison Square Garden, there's an expectation that you stay in your seat to allow those behind you to see the stage. Standing up can block the view for people behind you, which is generally considered rude or inconsiderate. \n\nThe author mentions that they were in the back sections on risers, which are designed to provide a good view even for those in the back. However, when everyone in front stands up, it can create a domino effect where each row behind is blocked. The older couple was frustrated because they couldn't see over the people in front of them. The author tried to compromise by sitting down during slower songs but then refused during more energetic songs. \n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Venue Etiquette**: Concerts often have guidelines to sit so those behind can see. Standing up in a seated area is generally frowned upon unless there's a standing section.\n2. **Impact on Others**: The author's actions directly affected the older couple's ability to enjoy the concert. Even though others were standing, the cumulative effect of multiple rows standing up blocks the view.\n3. **Attempts to Resolve**: The author did sit during slower songs, which shows some consideration, but then chose to stand again during popular songs, which might not be fair to those behind.\n4. **The Older Couple's Reaction**: Getting angry and yelling might be an overreaction, but it's a result of their view being blocked. The sarcastic clapping by others suggests they felt wronged as well.\n5. **The Young Couple's Apology**: They felt pressured by the older group, which indicates that the author's stance might have contributed to a tense environment.\n\nWhile the author might feel they're within their rights to enjoy the concert, the social contract in such settings usually prioritizes the group's needs over individual preferences. The author's refusal to sit down despite multiple requests shows a lack of respect for those behind them, even if they didn't ask directly. Hence, the author is in the wrong.\n"
