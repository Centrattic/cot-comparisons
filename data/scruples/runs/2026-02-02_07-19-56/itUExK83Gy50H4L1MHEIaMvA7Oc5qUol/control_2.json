It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is at an Elton John concert where they were sitting in the floor seats on risers. During the concert, when the music starts, people in front stand up, so they join them. But then people behind them, an older couple and others, keep asking them to sit down. The author tries to be respectful, sits down during a slower song, but then when the music gets upbeat again, they stand up again. The older couple gets angry, and there's some tension.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong by standing up despite being asked to sit. Let's break this down. First, concert etiquette usually involves respecting others' views. If someone is behind you and can't see the stage because you're standing, it's generally polite to sit down. However, in some concerts, especially with high-energy music like Elton John's, people might stand and dance. \n\nIn this case, the author is in the back section. When they stand, people behind can't see. They did try to sit down when asked, but then stood again when the song changed. The older couple was frustrated, and even others around them started clapping sarcastically. The author felt it's their right to stand if everyone else is doing it. But the issue is that their standing was blocking others.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The people behind had a right to enjoy the concert without obstruction. 2) The author could have found a middle ground, like standing in a way that minimizes blocking, or sitting when necessary. 3) The fact that others around them were also standing doesn't necessarily justify blocking the view for those behind. \n\nAlso, the author's response of flat-out refusing and giving a dirty look might have escalated the situation. While it's understandable to want to enjoy the concert, the balance between personal enjoyment and consideration for others is important. In this scenario, the author's actions impacted others' experience. So, maybe they are in the wrong for not consistently sitting down when it was affecting others' view, despite the concert's energetic nature. \n\nBut another angle: if the venue provided standing room or if it's common at such concerts to stand, maybe the expectation is different. However, since they were seated in chairs, the expectation might be that people remain seated to allow everyone a view. The author's justification is that it's an Elton John concert, but the presence of chairs might imply a seated audience. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they disregarded the requests of those behind them, leading to conflict, even though they tried to compromise initially. The fact that others were standing doesn't absolve them of responsibility to not block views if they can be asked to sit.\n"
