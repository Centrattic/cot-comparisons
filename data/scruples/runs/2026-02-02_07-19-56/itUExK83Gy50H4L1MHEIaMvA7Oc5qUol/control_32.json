It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. They went to an Elton John concert with floor seats on risers. The people behind them, an older couple and others, kept asking them to sit down because standing was blocking their view. The author and those in front initially sat down, but during certain songs, they stood again. The older couple got angry and started sarcastically clapping, leading to some tension.\n\nNow, the key points here are about concert etiquette and respecting others' views. Concert venues often have standing areas or rules to prevent blocking. If the author was in a seated section, standing might be against the venue's policy. However, the article mentions that chairs were provided, which might imply that standing isn't allowed there. If the author's standing was blocking others, even if others in front were also standing, it's a problem because they're behind.\n\nThe author argues that everyone is standing, so it's okay. But if their section is on risers meant for seated viewing, standing could compromise the experience for those behind. The people behind the author are the ones with the issue since they can't see past the standing audience. The author's actions, while perhaps in line with the crowd's behavior, might be considered inconsiderate because they ignored direct requests and contributed to blocking others' views.\n\nThe older couple's frustration is understandable if they paid for seats expecting to see the stage without obstruction. The author's refusal to sit down despite the requests and the subsequent confrontation suggest they were inconsiderate of others' needs. Even if the music is energetic, respecting the seating arrangement and others' lines of sight is part of concert etiquette. The author might not be the sole problem, but their actions did contribute to the issue, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
