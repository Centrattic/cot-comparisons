It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for standing up at the concert even when people behind them asked them to sit down. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe user went to an Elton John concert with floor seats. They were in the back section, and when the show started, everyone in front started standing and dancing. They joined in. Then, after the second song, an older couple behind them asked them to sit down. The user complied during a slower song but then continued standing for other songs, which led to more complaints. Eventually, the older couple got angry, and there was some sarcastic clapping. The user felt that since most people were standing, they should be allowed to do so.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about seating arrangement, the expectations of the attendees, and the interactions between people. The venue provided chairs, which might imply that sitting is expected, but concert culture, especially for certain artists, can be more lively with people standing and dancing even if there are seats. \n\nThe user's defense is that it's an Elton John concert, and many people were standing. The problem arises because the older couple couldn't see the stage because the people in front were standing. That's a common issue in concerts where seating is set up on risers. If the people in front stand up, they block the view for those behind. \n\nSo, the user's actions directly affected the older couple's ability to enjoy the concert. Even though the user tried to mediate by making some people in front sit down, the issue resurfaced when they stood again during a song. The fact that the young couple behind apologized suggests that there was pressure from the older people, which the user ignored.\n\nI think the main issue here is about consideration for others. While concerts can be energetic, the seating arrangement was designed in a way that if people in front stand, they block the view. The user chose to stand even after being asked, which was disrespectful to those behind. The fact that others were also standing doesn't absolve them from the responsibility to consider their neighbors. \n\nThe user's justification about the concert type might not hold because the venue provided chairs. Even if most people stand, it's a matter of common courtesy to allow those who need to sit (like older individuals) a clear view. The user's continued refusal to sit, especially after multiple requests, likely made the situation uncomfortable for others. \n\nSo, I think the user is in the wrong here. They should have been more accommodating and found a balance between their desire to enjoy the concert and ensuring others could do the same. Standing up is their right, but not at the expense of others' experience. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
