It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The situation involves an Elton John concert where the author and others stood during upbeat songs, leading to complaints from an older couple behind them. The author then refused to sit down, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Concerts can vary in etiquette based on the artist and the setup. Floor seats with chairs might imply that sitting is the norm, but sometimes people stand, especially for dancing. The key points here are the requests from others and the author's response.\n\nThe author mentions that when the older couple behind started asking them to sit down, they initially complied during a slower song. But during a more energetic song, they stood again, ignoring further requests. The older couple got angry and even sarcastically clapped, leading the author to give a dirty look. The younger couple later apologized, feeling pressured by the older ones.\n\nNow, etiquette in concerts often revolves around not blocking the view of others. If standing up prevents people behind from seeing the stage, it's considered rude. The author was in the back rows on risers, so their standing might block the view for those behind. Even though others in front were standing, the author's actions directly affected the older couple's view. \n\nThe fact that the author initially sat down when asked during a slow song shows some consideration, but then decided to stand again when it suited them. The refusal to comply with the requests, especially when the older couple was frustrated, seems inconsiderate. The author's justification is that everyone else was standing, but that doesn't exempt them from the responsibility to ensure those behind can see.\n\nAlso, the sarcastic clapping and the author's dirty look indicate a breakdown in mutual respect. While concerts can be lively, respecting others' right to see the performance is important. The author might have thought they were part of a standing crowd, but the setup with chairs suggests that sitting is expected. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did create a conflict by not consistently respecting the older couple's need to see the concert. Their decision to stand despite repeated requests, and the subsequent confrontational behavior, likely placed them in the wrong.\n"
