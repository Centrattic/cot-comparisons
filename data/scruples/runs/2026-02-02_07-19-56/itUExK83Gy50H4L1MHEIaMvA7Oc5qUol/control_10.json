It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when people behind them asked them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The concert was Elton John at Madison Square Garden. They got floor seats in a back section with risers. When the show started, everyone in front stood up to dance, so they joined in. People behind (an older couple and others) asked them to sit down. They tried to accommodate by sitting during a slower song. But during a popular song, they stood again, and the people behind got angry. The couple ended up clapping sarcastically, and the author gave them a dirty look. The young couple behind apologized later, feeling pressured by the older ones.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the concert setup, the seating arrangement, the age of the people involved, and the cultural context of the event. The author is defending their choice by saying everyone else was standing, so they should be allowed to. But the people behind them couldn't see the stage if they were standing.\n\nI need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, if you have seated tickets, you're supposed to stay seated so those behind can see. However, sometimes at concerts, people stand up regardless, especially for popular songs. But if your standing blocks others, it's considered rude. The author was in the back, so maybe their standing would block the older couple more. But the front rows standing up would have a bigger impact. The author tried to mediate by getting the front rows to sit down, which helped the older couple see. However, during a specific song, they refused again, leading to conflict.\n\nThe older couple might feel that since they paid for seats, they expect to see the stage without obstruction. The author argues that it's an Elton John concert, which is about dancing and enjoying the music, so standing is natural. But the problem is the older couple's visibility. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they prioritized their own enjoyment over the older couple's ability to see the show.\n\nThe fact that the young couple apologized suggests that the older couple's pressure was a social issue. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong entirely because the main issue is the seating arrangement. However, the author did ignore requests to sit down, which could be seen as disrespectful. The resolution where they sat during slower songs shows they tried to compromise, but then they went back to standing during a popular song, which might be the point where they crossed a line.\n\nIn summary, it's a conflict between personal enjoyment and respecting others' experience. The author might be partially at fault for not fully respecting the older couple's need to see the stage, especially after being asked multiple times. But the concert environment where people dance could also be a factor. However, since they had seated tickets, the expectation is to stay seated unless the venue allows standing. Since they were in a seated section, standing up repeatedly could be considered wrong.\n"
