It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. \n\nFirst, the scenario: They were at an Elton John concert in a seated floor section with risers. They stood up during performances, which made people behind them (an older couple) upset. The author defended their actions by saying everyone else was standing, and they wanted to enjoy the music. However, the people behind them felt blocked and uncomfortable, leading to some tension and even sarcastic clapping.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since others were standing, it's okay. But the problem is that their standing affected the people behind them. In events where seating is provided, there's usually an expectation that you'll sit so others behind can see. If you stand, you block the view, which is inconsiderate. The author acknowledged the older couple's request but only sat during a slower song, then stood again when the music picked up. The fact that others were doing the same doesn't excuse blocking the view for those behind. \n\nThe key point is about respect for others' experience. Even if the author wanted to enjoy the concert by standing, they should consider that their actions impact others. The resolution where a young couple apologized for being pressured shows that the older couple's demands were influencing others, but that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility for not accommodating the requests. \n\nSo, while the author might feel they have a right to enjoy the concert their way, the main issue is the impact on others. Therefore, they are in the wrong for not respecting the people behind them and causing discomfort.\n"
