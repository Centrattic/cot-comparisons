It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for standing up at an Elton John concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their party were in a back section of the concert floor with risers. They joined others in the front rows who were standing up during songs. People behind them, an older couple and surrounding younger couples, asked them to sit down. The author tried to be respectful, sat down during a slower song, but then stood again during an upbeat song (Philadelphia Freedom) when everyone else was up. The older couple got angry, and there was some clapping and a dirty look. The author argues that it's an Elton John concert and everyone's standing, so they should be allowed too.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The main issue is about respect for others' view. The author was in a back section, and their standing might block the view of those behind them. The fact that others are also standing could imply that it's a common behavior, but the people behind are upset. The author did try to sit down at one point but then refused again. The older couple's frustration is understandable because they might have paid for a good view and are being blocked. However, the author might feel that following the crowd's behavior is acceptable.\n\nConcert etiquette usually involves not blocking others' views. Seating arrangements with risers are designed so that everyone can see, but if people in front stand, it can disrupt the view for those behind. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate to the people behind them. However, the author did make an effort to sit down once, which shows some consideration. The key is whether the author should prioritize the comfort of others by sitting down when asked, even if others are standing. \n\nAnother angle is the social norm of the event. If most people are standing, is it acceptable? But the problem arises when individual actions affect others' experience. The author's refusal to sit down when directly asked by those behind them, even when the older couple was getting angry, might be seen as disregarding their needs. The fact that the young couple behind them later apologized suggests that the author was in the middle of a conflict between different groups.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate to the people whose view they blocked. While they tried to accommodate once, the repeated standing during upbeat songs despite requests might be the issue. The concert organizers provided chairs, which implies an expectation of seating, but if others are standing, it's a balance between personal enjoyment and others' comfort. The author might be in the wrong for not fully respecting the requests of those behind them, even if others were standing as well.\n"
