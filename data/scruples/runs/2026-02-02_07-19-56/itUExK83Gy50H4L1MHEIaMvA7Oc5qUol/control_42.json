It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for standing up at a concert despite being asked to sit down by people behind them. The scenario involves a concert where the author and others stand during songs, which blocks the view for an older couple. \n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Generally, if someone's view is being blocked, it's polite to sit down, especially if you're in the back. But the author mentions that everyone else in front was standing, so maybe there's a cultural expectation here. Elton John concerts might have a tradition of audience participation, like standing and dancing.\n\nThe author tried to compromise by sitting during a slower song, but then stood again during a popular song. The older couple got frustrated and others started clapping sarcastically. The author felt it was their right to enjoy the music. \n\nI should think about both sides. The couple behind might feel they paid for seats and deserve an unobstructed view. On the other hand, the author and the majority were following the crowd's lead. \n\nIs there a clear rule about standing in seated sections? The concert venue provided chairs, which might imply seated areas, but maybe the audience is expected to stand as part of the experience. The author's refusal to sit despite requests could be seen as inconsiderate, but if the majority is doing it, maybe it's acceptable. \n\nThe key points are: the author was in a seated section, others were standing, the couple behind was upset about the view. The author's actions caused some conflict. \n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. But in terms of etiquette, respecting others' views by sitting when asked is usually expected. So the answer might lean towards AITA being the author, but there's nuance because of the crowd's behavior. However, since the author was in a seated section, they might be expected to sit. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
