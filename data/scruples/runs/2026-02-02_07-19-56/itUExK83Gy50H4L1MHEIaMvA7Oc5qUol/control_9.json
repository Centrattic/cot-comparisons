It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The scenario involves an Elton John concert where the author and others stand up during upbeat songs, which blocks the view for an older couple behind. The author sits down during slower songs but stands again for the next songs, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Usually, concerts are about enjoying the music, and in seated areas, people often stand if they want to dance or move. However, if standing blocks the view for others, it's considered rude. The key here is whether the author obstructed the view. Since they were in the back rows, standing up might block the view for those behind them. The older couple is in front, so their view is blocked. Wait, no\u2014the people behind are the ones asking them to sit. The author is in a section with chairs on risers. If the author is standing, they might block the view for those behind. Wait, no. If they're in the back, when they stand up, they would block the view of people behind them. But the people behind would be in higher risers? Wait, the seating is on risers creating a slope. So if the author is in a higher row, standing up might block the view for those in front. Wait, the setup is sloped. Let me clarify: in a typical concert venue with a sloped seating arrangement, each row is elevated higher than the one in front. So if someone is in a back row, standing up might not block the view of those in front because they're lower. But if they're in a back row and standing, the people behind them (higher rows) might not be blocked. Wait, the author says they are in one of the back sections. When they stand up, the people behind (higher rows) can't see over them. So the author's standing blocks the view of the people behind. That's the issue here.\n\nThe older couple is behind the author. So when the author stands, they block the older couple's view. The author joined others in front who were standing, so maybe the front rows are standing, which is normal. But if the author is in a back row, standing up would block the people behind. So the people behind (the older couple) are asking them to sit to have a clear view. The author sits down during slower songs but stands again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom.\" The older couple gets angry and the author refuses, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Concert etiquette usually suggests that if you're in a seated area, you should remain seated to maintain views for others. However, some concerts allow standing if it doesn't obstruct others. The key here is whether the author's standing was blocking the view of others. Since they were in the back and the people behind them are in higher rows, their standing would indeed block the view. So, by standing, they are being inconsiderate to the people behind them. However, the author argues that everyone else was standing, so they should be allowed to as well. But if the venue's structure means that standing in the back blocks the view of higher rows, then the author is in the wrong. They could have chosen to sit to avoid obstructing others. The fact that they tried to sit during slower songs but stood again during upbeat songs shows they were aware of the issue but chose to prioritize their own enjoyment over others' viewing experience. The older couple's frustration is valid because they paid for their seats and expect to see the stage without obstruction. The author's decision to stand despite repeated requests is inconsiderate. The young couple who apologized felt pressured by the older couple, which also indicates social pressure to conform to seating norms in that area. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they obstructed others' view despite being asked to sit down.\n"
