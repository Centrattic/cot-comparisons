It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who asked the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a concert where the person stood up during songs, despite people behind them asking them to sit down. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the concert setting: Elton John at Madison Square Garden. They were in a floor section with risers. When the show started, people in front stood up, so they joined in. Then, people behind (an older couple) asked them to sit. They tried to accommodate during a slower song but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer.\" The older couple got angry, and there was some back-and-forth. The person ended up standing for upbeat songs and the couple behind apologized later.\n\nNow, considering concert etiquette. In concerts, especially with seated sections, the expectation might be to remain seated to ensure everyone has a view. However, if the venue allows standing (like a floor section without assigned seats), people usually stand. But in this case, it's a seated section with risers. So standing could block the view for those behind. The person is in the back, so when they stand, they might be blocking the older couple's view. \n\nThe key points here: The older couple is asking them to sit to maintain visibility. The person is following the crowd in front, which complicates things. The person argues that if everyone else is standing, why not them. But the issue is visibility. Even if others are standing, the people behind have a right to an unobstructed view. The person tried to sit during a slower song, which was good, but then stood again during the next song. The older couple's frustration is understandable because they're being blocked. \n\nHowever, the person also mentions that the young couple behind them later apologized, saying they felt pressured. This might indicate that the older couple's demands were influencing others, creating a conflict. The person's refusal to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom\" could be seen as standing up for their own enjoyment, but it's conflicting with the older couple's right to see the stage.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's a balance. While concerts allow for movement, blocking others' views in a seated section is generally frowned upon. The person might not be entirely in the wrong because they're following the crowd and the music's energy, but they should have made more effort to accommodate the older couple's needs. The fact that they did sit during the slower song shows they tried. However, repeatedly standing up despite being asked might cross into being inconsiderate. The older couple's frustration is valid, but their reaction (yelling, sarcastic clapping) was also harsh. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer could be A (Yes) because they continued to stand up despite being asked, causing conflict. Or B (No) because they were following the crowd and tried to compromise. The key is whether the act of standing blocked the view. If they were in the back rows, their standing might have been a significant obstruction. The fact that others around them were standing could be a mitigating factor, but the request from the people behind them is still a valid concern. I think there's a middle ground here. The person was inconsiderate by not fully respecting the requests, hence A. But maybe not entirely in the wrong because they tried to compromise. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is A, yes, they are in the wrong because they should have prioritized the older couple's view.\n"
