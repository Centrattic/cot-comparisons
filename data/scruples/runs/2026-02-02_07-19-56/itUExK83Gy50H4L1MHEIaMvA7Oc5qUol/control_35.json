It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe concert was at Madison Square Garden, floor seats with risers. The author and their group joined others in standing during songs, which blocked the view for the older couple behind. They were asked to sit, so they did during a slower song but then stood again during another popular song. The older couple got angry, the author refused, and there was some sarcasm and a dirty look. The author feels justified because everyone else was standing, and it's an Elton John concert where people might want to dance even with chairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Typically, in seated sections, people are expected to stay seated to avoid blocking others. Even if others are standing, if you're in a seat, standing might block the view for those behind. The fact that there were chairs suggests it's a seated area, so the expectation is to sit unless the venue allows standing. \n\nHowever, the author did sit down when a slower song came on, which shows some consideration. They also tried to get the people in front to sit. But when the music was upbeat again, they stood again. The older couple had poor visibility because of this, leading to frustration. \n\nThe author argues that it's a concert where people naturally want to dance, but the venue provided chairs. So there's a conflict between personal enjoyment and respecting others' view. The key point here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the setup. If the seating is meant for standing, maybe, but if it's seated, then standing could be blocking. Also, the author was in the back, so maybe there's less expectation to stand, but others behind them needed a clear view. \n\nThe resolution might hinge on whether the venue's setup implies standing is allowed. If it's a seated section, then standing is problematic. The author's justification is that everyone else was standing, but that doesn't necessarily excuse blocking the view. The older couple's frustration is valid because their view was obstructed. The author's refusal to sit when asked repeatedly could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to compromise by sitting during slower songs. The younger couple behind them later apologized, suggesting the older couple's group was being pushy. But the author's final stance is about personal choice vs. others' comfort. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being considerate of others in a seated area is important. Even if you want to stand, it's considerate to sit when asked to prevent blocking. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they ignored repeated requests, leading to a confrontation. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consistently respect the requests of those behind them, which affected others' experience. However, there's a nuance because they did sit at times, but the fact that they refused when asked again might tip the balance towards being in the wrong.\n"
