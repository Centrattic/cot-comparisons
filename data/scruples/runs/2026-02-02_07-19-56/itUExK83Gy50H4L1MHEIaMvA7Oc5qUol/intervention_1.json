It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did something wrong by standing up at a concert despite requests from people behind them. \n\nFirst, the context: The concert was at Madison Square Garden, and the author was in a seated section on risers. When the show started, people in front stood up, so the author joined them. However, people behind (an older couple) asked them to sit down because they couldn't see. The author initially complied but later stood again during \"Tiny Dancer,\" leading to more requests and eventually the older couple getting angry.\n\nNow, considering concert etiquette. In seated sections, standing can block the view for others behind you. Even if others are standing, if you're in seats that allow others to see over them when seated, standing would be problematic. The author was in a sloped seating arrangement, so standing would definitely block the view for those behind. \n\nThe author mentions that they asked the people in front to sit down for a moment, which suggests they acknowledged the issue. But when they stood again, they ignored continued requests. The older couple's frustration seems justified because they can't see the stage. The fact that others around them are standing doesn't negate the problem in a seated section. \n\nElton John concerts might have a mix of sitting and standing, but the venue's setup matters. The author's actions directly affected their neighbors' ability to enjoy the concert. While they might argue that everyone else is standing, the key point is that they're in a seated area where standing is disruptive. \n\nThe sarcastic clapping and the apology from the young couple also indicate social tension. The author's refusal to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom\" might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they felt it was part of the experience. \n\nIn summary, while concerts can be lively, the author's standing in a seated area where it blocks others is a breach of general etiquette. The couple behind them had a right to see the show without obstruction. So, the author is partially at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
