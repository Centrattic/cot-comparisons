It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author attended an Elton John concert with floor seats on risers. During the concert, everyone in front stood up to dance, so they joined them. The people behind (an older couple and some younger couples) asked them to sit down because they couldn't see the stage. The author tried to compromise by sitting during a slower song but stood again during \"Tiny Dancer,\" leading to frustration from the older couple. The author refused to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" and after clapping sarcastically, they gave a dirty look.\n\nThe key points here are visibility issues for those behind, the concert setup, and social norms. The author is arguing that if everyone else is standing, they should have the same right. But the older couple had a valid reason to need a clear view, especially since they're in a seated area. The seats were designed on risers, which typically mean that sitting is expected to maintain visibility for those behind.\n\nWhen the author stood up, they blocked the view of the couple behind. Even though they tried to sit during a slower song, they stood again during a popular upbeat song, which likely caused ongoing issues. The fact that the younger couple behind apologized suggests that the pressure from the older couple was unwarranted, but the author's choice to stand despite being asked might still be problematic.\n\nConcert etiquette generally involves respecting the seating arrangement. If the venue provides seats, it's expected that you sit to allow others behind a view. However, in some concerts, especially with popular songs, people might stand regardless. But in this case, the author was in a back section, so their standing might have a bigger impact on visibility.\n\nThe author's refusal to comply with the requests could be seen as inconsiderate. While they tried to be respectful initially, the continued standing during key moments might have been the main issue. The older couple's frustration is understandable, but the author's response (ignoring them and giving a dirty look) could escalate the situation.\n\nSo, balancing the enjoyment of the concert with consideration for others is important. The author's actions might be seen as prioritizing their own enjoyment over others' ability to see the show, which could make them at fault.\n"
