It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. The scenario involves an Elton John concert where the author and others in front of them stood up during songs, blocking the view for an older couple behind them. The author tried to be respectful by sitting during a slower song but then resumed standing during another popular song, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around concerts. Typically, concerts have a certain expectation of behavior. If someone is seated in a riser arrangement, standing up can block the view for those behind. The author was in a back section on risers, so standing up would block people behind them. The older couple is asking them to sit down to maintain their view, which is a reasonable request.\n\nThe author argues that everyone else was standing, so they should be allowed to do the same. However, that might not be a valid justification because the people behind them had a legitimate view issue. The author did attempt to accommodate by sitting during a slower song, but then resumed standing, which escalated the situation. The older couple got angry and sarcastic clapping happened, which indicates the author's actions were causing discomfort.\n\nThe key points here are respect for others' experience versus personal enjoyment. While concerts can be energetic, seating arrangements are designed to provide a view for all. Standing in a seated area, especially in a riser setup, disrupts that. The author might not be the sole offender, but they did contribute to the problem by not respecting the requests of those behind them, especially after the initial compromise.\n\nAlso, the fact that the young couple behind apologized suggests that the pressure from the older couple was affecting others, and the author's refusal to sit might have contributed to that pressure. The author's enjoyment shouldn't come at the expense of others' ability to see the concert. Therefore, the author should have been more considerate and found a middle ground, perhaps by standing in a way that minimizes obstruction or moving to a standing area if possible.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
