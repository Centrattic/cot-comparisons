It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about standing up at a concert despite people behind asking them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. They went to an Elton John concert at Madison Square Garden. The seats were on risers, sloped. They were in a back section. When the concert started, people in front stood up and they joined. Then people behind (an older couple and others) asked them to sit down. They complied during a slow song but stood again during another song. The older couple got angry, and there was some clapping and dirty looks. The author defends their action by saying everyone else is standing, so why not them?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to check. So, the possible angles here: concert etiquette, seating arrangements, considering others' views, and the social norms of concerts.\n\nElton John concerts, especially with older audiences, might have people who prefer sitting. The risers are designed so that everyone can see, so if people in the back stand, they block those behind. But in this case, the author was in the back, so when they stand, they block the people behind. But the ones asking them to sit are the older couple behind them. The author tried to ask the front rows to sit down to see the stage, which suggests that the problem is about their own visibility? Wait, no. If they were in the back, standing would block the people behind them, not the ones in front. Wait, the author says they were in one of the back sections. If they stand up, they block the view for the people behind them. So the people behind them (the older couple) can't see because the author is standing. So the author is blocking the view of the older couple. \n\nConcert etiquette usually expects that you don't block people's views. If you're in the back, you need to stay seated if you're blocking those behind. Even if everyone else is standing, if your standing up prevents others from seeing, it's considered rude. But sometimes, in standing areas, people are aware that people behind might be blocked. But in seated concerts, the chairs are supposed to be for sitting, but if people stand, they might block others. \n\nThe author tried to mediate by asking the front rows to sit, which made their view possible. But when they stood again during another song, the people behind were upset. The author's defense is that others were standing too. However, the key issue is that they were in a seated section, and their standing was causing a problem for the people behind. So even if others are standing, if you're in a position where your standing blocks others, you should consider their needs. \n\nSo, the author's actions were causing inconvenience to others. They were in a seated section, so perhaps the expectation is that you sit to maintain everyone's view. Even if the venue allows standing, it's about being considerate. The older couple's frustration makes sense because they can't see the stage. The author's refusal to sit, despite being asked, shows a lack of consideration. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that it's a concert where people want to dance, and the venue provided chairs but didn't enforce sitting. There's a balance between personal enjoyment and others' experience. In this case, the people behind couldn't see because the author was standing. The author's actions directly impacted their view. \n\nSo, in terms of social norms, the expectation is to not block others' views. Even if you're in a seated section, you should stay seated if your standing affects those behind. Therefore, the author was in the wrong because they didn't consider the people behind them and persisted despite being asked. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
