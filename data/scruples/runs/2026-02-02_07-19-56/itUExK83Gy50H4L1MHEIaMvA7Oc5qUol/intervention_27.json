It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite being asked to sit down by people behind them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The concert was for Elton John, who is known for energetic songs like \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" which people often stand and dance to even if there are seats. The author and others in front were standing, which is a common behavior at such concerts. \n\nThe people behind, an older couple and their neighbors, were upset because they couldn't see the stage due to the standing crowd. The author tried to accommodate by sitting during slower songs but refused during upbeat ones. The older couple got angry and sarcastic, and the author responded with a dirty look.\n\nNow, the main issue is about balance between personal enjoyment and consideration for others. The author's argument is that when everyone else is standing, it's reasonable to do so, especially for music that invites movement. However, the people behind them had a legitimate problem with visibility, especially in a sloped seating arrangement where standing could block their view.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The seating was designed to allow visibility, but standing disrupts that. 2) The author made an effort to sit during slower songs, showing some consideration. 3) The older couple felt their experience was negatively impacted and the situation escalated.\n\nBut the author's refusal during the more energetic songs might be seen as prioritizing their own enjoyment over the comfort of others, even if it's a common behavior in concerts. However, concerts often have a culture of standing during certain songs regardless of seating. The fact that others in front were also standing might mitigate the author's responsibility, as they followed the crowd.\n\nThe question is whether the author should have found a middle ground. They did sit during some parts but refused during others. The older couple's frustration is understandable, but the author might not be entirely at fault since the concert environment encourages such behavior. However, the author could have been more accommodating, perhaps by ensuring that they weren't part of a block that completely obscured the view for those behind.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for a balance between personal enjoyment and consideration. Here, the author tried to compromise but might have failed to address the specific issue of visibility for the older couple. The sarcastic clapping and dirty look suggest that the conflict escalated, which could make the author partially at fault for not resolving it more diplomatically.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might share some responsibility, but the situation is a bit nuanced. However, since the concert's nature encourages standing, especially for certain songs, the author's actions are somewhat justifiable. But the refusal to sit when others behind felt it was necessary might make them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
