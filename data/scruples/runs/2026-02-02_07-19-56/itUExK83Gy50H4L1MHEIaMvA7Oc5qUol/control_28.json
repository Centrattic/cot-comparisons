It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for standing up at a concert when people behind them kept asking them to sit down. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were at an Elton John concert in a floor section with chairs on risers. They were in the back, and when the show started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. The people two rows behind were an older couple surrounded by younger ones. After the second song, the older couple asked them to sit down. The author complied during a slow song but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom.\" The older couple got angry, and the young couple behind them felt pressured and apologized. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the dynamics of concert etiquette. In many concerts, especially for artists like Elton John, people often stand up to dance or enjoy the music, especially during popular songs. The author was in a section where standing was the norm. However, the people behind them couldn't see the stage because they were standing. The author tried to accommodate by sitting down during a slow song but then resumed standing during upbeat songs when others did too. The older couple's frustration is because their view is blocked, but the author feels it's reasonable to stand when the crowd does.\n\nNow, considering concert behavior: the venue provided chairs, which implies they might expect seated viewing. However, some attendees might stand regardless. The issue is visibility. The author was in a back section, so maybe their standing wasn't the main problem. But the couple behind them is an older demographic, which might have different expectations\u2014perhaps they prefer sitting. \n\nThe author's actions: they first asked the people in front to sit down, which helped the couple behind. Then, during popular songs, they stood again, which the older couple continued to get upset about. The author argues that when everyone else is standing, they shouldn't be the only ones sitting. But from the couple's perspective, their view is blocked, which is a legitimate concern, especially if they paid for the seats expecting to see the stage. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did try to accommodate by sitting during a slow song, but then resumed standing when others did. The couple behind them might not have realized that the author was following the crowd's lead. The author didn't block the view intentionally; they were just participating in the typical concert behavior. The couple's reaction escalated, and the author didn't force anyone to stand. The venue's setup with chairs might suggest they should stay seated, but it's also common for people to stand even with chairs. The author's refusal to sit during a song everyone was dancing to could be seen as inconsiderate, but maybe that's just part of the concert experience. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the venue expects attendees to stay seated or if it's acceptable to stand even in seated areas. Since it's a concert where movement is common, the author might not be in the wrong. They made an effort to help but couldn't be expected to stay seated if the crowd was doing it. The older couple's frustration is understandable, but the author's actions were in line with the majority. So probably the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
