It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for standing up at a concert even though people behind them asked them to sit down. The situation is at an Elton John concert in a seated floor section. The user and their group joined others in front to stand during upbeat songs but got complaints from people behind.\n\nFirst, consider concert etiquette. In many concerts, especially with seated sections, standing is allowed unless specified otherwise. The venue provided chairs, but that doesn't necessarily mean people can't stand if space allows. However, blocking the view is a key issue. The user mentioned that when the older couple asked, they sat down during a slower song to let the people in front see the stage. Then they stood again for another song. The problem arises when standing blocks the view for behind. \n\nThe user argues that everyone else was standing, so why not them. But the key point is that the people behind them (the older couple and others) were seated and couldn't see the stage if others were standing in front. Venues often arrange seating so that each row is higher than the one in front, allowing visibility. If people in front stand, it blocks the view for those behind, which is a common issue in concerts. \n\nThe user tried to be respectful by sitting during a slower song, but then stood again. The older couple became frustrated and even others started clapping sarcastically. The user's refusal to comply when asked might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they felt others were doing the same. \n\nOn the other hand, concerts can be lively, and some people do stand even in seated sections. The user wasn't in a standing-only pit. However, the main issue is visibility. If standing up is causing a problem for others, then it's reasonable to expect that the person should sit down. The user's actions led to conflict, and the fact that the young couple behind them later apologized suggests that the pressure from the older couple was significant. \n\nSo, balancing the enjoyment of the concert with consideration for others' view is important. The user might have been in the wrong because they didn't consistently maintain a seated position when asked, leading to others' frustration. While they tried to compromise once, the repeated standing caused ongoing issues.\n"
