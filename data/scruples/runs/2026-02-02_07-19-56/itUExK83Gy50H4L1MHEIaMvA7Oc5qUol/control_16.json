It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a concert where they stood up during songs, and people behind them kept asking them to sit down. The author refused and even got into some conflict with the older couple behind them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. They were at an Elton John concert in a seated area with risers. When the music started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind, an older couple surrounded by younger ones, asked them to sit down. They tried to comply during a slower song but then stood again during upbeat songs like \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom\". The older couple got angry, and there was some sarcasm and a dirty look. The author feels like they're not in the wrong because everyone else was standing up too.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The main issue is blocking the view. In concerts, especially in seated sections, blocking the view is generally considered rude because it affects others' experience. The author was in a back section, so if they stood up, people behind them couldn't see. The people behind (the older couple) had a valid reason to ask them to sit down to maintain their view. The author did sit down once but then stood again when others did, which might have been seen as disregarding the requests even after a compromise.\n\nHowever, the author argues that it's an Elton John concert where people naturally stand to jam. The fact that there were no standing areas or pits might mean that the seating arrangement was supposed to accommodate movement while keeping views clear. The author's defense is that they were following the crowd's example, but if the crowd in front was standing, maybe the author's seating position made them part of the problem for the people behind.\n\nAnother angle is the escalation. The older couple got increasingly frustrated and even sarcastic, which might indicate that the author's actions were perceived as inconsiderate. Despite being asked by both the older couple and a young couple behind them, they refused, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's stance that they were just enjoying the concert might not take into account the specific needs of those behind them for a clear view.\n\nAlso, the author did sit down when possible (during slower songs), but during the more energetic songs, they stood up again. It's possible that the concert venue's layout with risers meant that standing during certain songs was expected, but if that's the case, maybe the seating wasn't appropriate for their position. Alternatively, maybe the author should have found a different way to enjoy the concert without blocking others.\n\nIn summary, the key points are about respecting others' views in a seated section. Even if others are standing, if the author's position blocks the view behind them, they have a responsibility to sit down when asked. The fact that they tried to adjust once but then continued to stand during other songs could be seen as inconsiderate. The older couple's frustration suggests that the author was in the wrong for not fully respecting their requests, even if others were doing the same. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
