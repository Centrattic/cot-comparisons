It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a concert where the author and their group kept standing up, even though people behind them asked them to sit down. \n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. Concerts can vary in terms of expected behavior. Some shows encourage standing and dancing, especially for certain genres. Elton John's music includes both upbeat and slower songs. The fact that many people were standing suggests it's part of the experience. However, the people behind them are older and might have issues seeing the stage if those in front are standing.\n\nThe author mentions being respectful and initially sitting down when the older couple asked. They even tried to get the people in front to sit, which helped the couple see. Then, during a popular song where everyone stands, they refuse again. The older couple gets frustrated and even starts clapping sarcastically. The author retaliates with a dirty look.\n\nNow, the key points: The author tried to accommodate by sitting during a slower song. However, when the music called for standing (like \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom\"), they chose to stand again. The people behind felt their view was blocked and were pressured to ask. The author's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate, especially after the couple had already asked nicely and the author had made a previous effort to comply. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of concert culture. If the majority of the audience is standing and dancing, it's part of the event's vibe. The author didn't do anything illegal or against rules, just followed the crowd. The issue is more about personal space and view obstruction. \n\nHowever, concert seating usually has a line of sight consideration. If the venue sold tickets that ensure a view, the author's standing might interfere with that. The author might be in the wrong because they knew the couple's view was an issue and kept blocking them despite being asked. The fact that the young couple apologized and felt pressured suggests the older couple's complaints were valid to some extent.\n\nOn the other hand, concerts are social events, and the author's actions were part of enjoying the music. The initial respect shown by sitting once shows they tried to compromise. The escalation to yelling and sarcastic clapping from the couple might indicate they were more at fault for being confrontational. \n\nBut I think the main issue is the repeated refusal after the couple had already asked. Even if the author tried once, continuing to stand during other songs after being asked multiple times could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't fully consider the impact on others, even if they tried once. Or maybe not, because it's a concert and standing is part of the experience. \n\nWait, but the author was in the back rows. People in front usually have the right to stand, but those behind might rely on seated people to see. The author's standing blocked the view for the older couple, who might have paid for a good spot. Repeatedly refusing to sit after being asked shows disregard for others' comfort. So, the answer is A.\n"
