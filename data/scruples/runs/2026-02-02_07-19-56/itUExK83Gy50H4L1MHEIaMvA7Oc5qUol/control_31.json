It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a concert where they stood up to dance, despite people behind them asking them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The concert was for Elton John, and the seating was on risers with chairs. The couple in question was in the back rows. They stood up during the show because everyone in front was doing the same. However, older people behind them kept asking them to sit down. The couple tried to accommodate once by sitting during a slower song, but then stood again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" leading to more complaints. The older couple got angry, sarcastic clapping occurred, and the couple gave a dirty look.\n\nNow, the main issue is visibility. The people in the back (the older couple) couldn't see the stage because the front rows were standing. In such events, it's common for people to stand, but if it blocks the view for others, especially in seated areas, it can be problematic. The couple in the front tried to balance their desire to dance with the people behind, but when they refused to sit during certain songs, it affected others' experience.\n\nI should consider concert etiquette. Typically, if you're in a seated area, you should avoid standing if it blocks taller people behind. However, sometimes concerts allow standing if most are doing it. The key here is that the couple was in the back rows, so their standing would block the view for those behind them. The fact that the older couple was surrounded by younger couples might mean that the back section was supposed to be seated, hence the chairs. The couple in front tried to sit during a slow song but then stood again during more upbeat songs, which the people behind found frustrating.\n\nAnother point is the escalation. The older couple became angry, and sarcastic clapping happened. The couple in question gave a dirty look, which indicates a lack of resolution. The young couple behind them later apologized, suggesting the older couple was being unreasonable, but the original couple's refusal to consistently sit down caused ongoing issues.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the couple had a right to enjoy the concert, but their actions affected others. Concert etiquette often prioritizes the comfort of all attendees. Since they were in a seated section, standing up and blocking others' view is generally considered inconsiderate. Even though others were doing the same, the specific issue here was the repeated requests from those behind them. Refusing to sit down despite these requests and the subsequent escalation suggests they were inconsiderate of the other attendees' needs.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while wanting to participate in the concert experience, ignored the impact on others. They were in a position where their standing blocked the view, and despite attempts to compromise, they continued to stand, leading to conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
