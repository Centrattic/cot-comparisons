It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They attended an Elton John concert, got floor seats in a back section with risers. When the concert started, everyone in front stood up to dance, so they joined. The people behind (an older couple and others) started asking them to sit down. They tried to accommodate by sitting during a slow song, but when the music picked up again, they stood up again. The older couple got angry and sarcastically clapped, leading to tension. The author feels their right to dance is valid since everyone else was doing it.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether standing up was wrong. Let me think about concert etiquette. In many concerts, especially for certain genres, it's common to stand and dance if the crowd does. If the venue has assigned seating, maybe there's an expectation to stay seated. But in this case, the front rows stood, and the people in the back tried to follow, creating a blockage. The issue is visibility. The people behind can't see the stage if those in front are standing. So, the author's actions might block others' view, which is generally considered rude.\n\nBut the author tried to mediate by making the front rows sit down initially. However, when the songs got upbeat again, they decided to stand despite the requests. The older couple became frustrated. The key points here are about respect for others' experience versus personal enjoyment. Concert venues often manage crowd flow and visibility, so maybe the author should prioritize not blocking others. Even if dancing is common, if their actions are causing others to not enjoy the concert, they might be in the wrong. Alternatively, since everyone else was up, maybe it's acceptable. But the author chose to stand even when asked, leading to conflict. The resolution was that the young couple apologized for being pressured by others, suggesting the author might have been a mediator in a larger issue. However, the author's actions contributed to the problem. So, maybe they are partly at fault for not respecting the people behind them, even if others were also dancing. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should have considered the view for those behind them, especially after being asked multiple times. But I need to be careful. The venue's setup and the fact that it's a seated area might mean that standing is not the norm. If chairs are provided, maybe they're supposed to stay seated. Alternatively, in some concerts, standing is allowed. The author's justification is that others were doing it. But if their standing directly blocks others, then it's a problem. So, the answer probably leans towards A.\n"
