It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite requests from people behind them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The concert is at Madison Square Garden, Elton John's show. The author is in the back rows on a raised section. They stood up during the concert, which is common for Elton's energetic songs. However, the people behind them (an older couple and others) are upset because their view is blocked. The author tried to sit down during a slow song but then stood again during popular songs like \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom.\" Eventually, the author ignores the requests more and gets a dirty look from the older couple.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The concert has assigned seating with chairs, but people are standing, especially during up-tempo songs. This is typical for Elton John concerts, as mentioned.\n2. The author was in the back, so standing might block the view of those behind. The problem arises because the people behind (the older couple) can't see the stage when others stand.\n3. The author tried to compromise by sitting during a slow song but then resumed standing. The people behind felt pressured and the author's actions might have contributed to that.\n\nNow, considering concert etiquette: in seated events, standing can block others' views. If the venue allows standing, it's usually in standing areas. Since this is a seated concert with chairs, the author's standing could be an issue. However, if everyone nearby is also standing, maybe it's more of a collective action rather than the author's fault alone. But the author was in the back, so their standing might not block as many as those in front.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's an Elton John concert where people often stand. But the fact that the people behind are older and maybe not as able to stand might play a role. The author also tried to sit once but then refused again when asked. The younger couple behind apologized, indicating the author might have been part of a group pressure situation.\n\nThe older couple's frustration is valid because their view is blocked. The author's right to enjoy the concert by standing is conflicting with others' right to see the show. The author's refusal to comply with requests could be seen as inconsiderate, even if others are doing the same. The key is whether the author should have prioritized the view of those behind them, especially since they were in the back and had a better chance to sit without blocking.\n\nIn summary, while the author isn't entirely at fault because the concert's culture encourages movement, their actions did cause issues for others. The author might have been inconsiderate by not consistently sitting down when asked, leading to the older couple's frustration. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they ignored multiple requests, even after the compromise, and their standing was a direct cause of blocking others' views.\n"
