It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the Elton John concert situation is in the wrong for standing up when others asked them to sit down. So, first, I need to consider both sides.\n\nThe author and their group were in a section with chairs on risers. When the concert started, everyone in front stood up, and they joined in. The people behind them, an older couple and others, asked them to sit down. The author tried to accommodate during a slower song but then stood up again during \"Tiny Dancer\" and other upbeat songs. The older couple got angry, and there was some tension.\n\nNow, the key factors here are visibility and concert etiquette. In a seated concert, especially with a sloped arrangement, standing up can block the view for people behind. That's a common issue in concerts. The author's actions might be seen as selfish if they knew their standing was obstructing others. However, if everyone else in front was standing, maybe the author felt it was part of the experience.\n\nElton John's concerts might have a mix of seated and standing, depending on the venue and event. The fact that the venue provided chairs but people still stood up could indicate that it's somewhat expected, but the author should consider the people behind. They tried to sit during a slower song, which shows some consideration, but then resumed standing when others did.\n\nThe older couple's frustration is valid because they paid for a good view and might not want to be blocked. The author's refusal to sit down, even when asked by the couple behind the young ones, might come off as dismissive. The sarcastic clapping and dirty looks added to the tension, which isn't ideal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that if everyone else is standing, why should they be the only ones to sit? That's a reasonable point, but concert etiquette often emphasizes being considerate of those behind you. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have been inconsiderate in this context. The solution might have been to find a middle ground, like sitting when the crowd sits and standing when they stand, but not necessarily the author's choice here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own enjoyment over the comfort of others, even after being asked to sit down multiple times. However, there's a counter-argument about the concert's atmosphere. But given the setup and the complaints from others, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
