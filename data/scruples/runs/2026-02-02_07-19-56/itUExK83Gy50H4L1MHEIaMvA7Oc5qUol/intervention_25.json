It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite people behind them asking to sit down. \n\nFirst, the situation: They went to an Elton John concert, got floor seats on risers. When the show started, people in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind, an older couple and others, asked them to sit. They tried to comply during a slower song, but then when the music picked up again, they stood up again. The older couple got angry and even sarcastic clapping happened. The author argues that everyone else was standing, so why not them?\n\nNow, considering social norms and concert etiquette. Concerts can vary in what's acceptable. Some concerts have standing areas, others have seated. In this case, they had assigned seats with chairs. If the venue provides seats, there's an expectation to stay seated, especially if others behind need a view. Even if others are standing, obstructing the view for those seated behind is a problem. The author acknowledged that by initially sitting down when asked but then resumed standing when the music called for it. \n\nThe key points here: Did the author consider the seating arrangement's purpose? If they're in a seated section, standing up repeatedly might be against the venue's rules and etiquette. The fact that others behind were unable to see properly and the older couple got upset suggests that the author's actions were disruptive. The author's reasoning that everyone else was standing might not hold because if others are also in seats, they should be aware of not blocking others. However, the author's actions led to a conflict, and they ended up ignoring requests despite others' discomfort.\n\nAlso, the author did make an effort to sit during slower songs but then refused when the music was upbeat again. The fact that the young couple behind them later apologized shows that maybe the author wasn't entirely at fault, but the main issue is the repeated refusal to sit when asked, leading to escalation. The author's right to enjoy the concert must balance with others' rights to have an unobstructed view. Since the venue provided seating for a reason, the author's choice to stand up during concerts where seating is expected might be considered inconsiderate. \n\nSo, while concerts can be lively, the seating arrangement matters. The author's actions caused conflict and obstruction, making them partly at fault. The answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't prioritize the seating arrangement's purpose and others' needs, even after being asked.\n"
