It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at an Elton John concert where the couple is in the back rows, and when everyone in front stands up to dance, they join in. But the people behind them, an older couple and others, keep asking them to sit down so they can see the stage. The couple complies once during a slower song but then stands again during another song, leading to frustration from the older couple who start clapping sarcastically. The author feels they were just enjoying the music and others were standing too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. In a seated concert, especially floor seats on risers, the expectation might be that people stay seated to allow those behind to see. If the front rows stand up, it blocks the view for those behind. However, the concert might be more interactive, like a musical where people are expected to move. \n\nThe author mentions that everyone in front was standing, so they joined in. That seems like they're following the crowd. But the people behind them are being obstructed. The author tried to mediate by asking the front rows to sit so they could see, which worked for a while. But when the songs picked up again, they stood back up. The older couple got angry, and there was some tension. The neighbors behind them later apologized, feeling pressured.\n\nSo, the key points are: concert venue setup, expectations of the audience, and the balance between personal enjoyment and others' ability to see. The author argues that if others are standing, they should have the right to too. However, the people behind them have a valid complaint about visibility. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because even though others are standing, their position in the back means their standing blocks the view. The fact that they had to ask others to sit to accommodate the older couple initially shows awareness of the issue, but then they reverted. The sarcastic clapping and the dirty look indicate escalating conflict.\n\nIn such a situation, even if others are standing, there's an unspoken rule that if you're in the back rows, you should stay seated to avoid blocking. The couple's refusal to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom\" despite the requests might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author could argue that the concert's nature allows for movement. But the main issue is the impact on others' experience. The resolution where others apologized suggests that the pressure wasn't entirely the author's fault, but the author's actions contributed to the conflict. So, it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being partially at fault for not respecting the older couple's need to see the stage despite others also standing. The answer might be A, but maybe B if the concert's atmosphere is more about participation. Hmm.\n"
