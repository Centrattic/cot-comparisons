It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for standing up at a concert despite requests from people behind them to sit down. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The concert was Elton John at Madison Square Garden. They were in the back rows on a riser. When the show started, people in front stood up, and they joined in. The people behind, an older couple surrounded by younger couples, asked them to sit down. The author tried to be respectful by sitting during a slower song and even asked the front rows to sit. But during popular songs like \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" they stood again, leading to frustration from the older couple. The older couple got angry, and sarcastic clapping happened. The author ended up giving a dirty look.\n\nNow, the key points here: concerts often have varying behaviors. In some concerts, people stand, especially for certain songs. But the issue here is blocking the view for those behind. The author was in the back, so when they stand, they might be obstructing the view of the older couple. The author did attempt to compromise by sitting during a slower song, but then resumed standing during energetic songs. The older couple's frustration is understandable because they can't see the stage. However, the author argues that everyone else was standing, so why not them?\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The author's right to enjoy the concert versus the view of those behind. Concert venues usually seat people in a way that taller people are in back, but this might not have been the case here. The author's actions affected the couple's experience. But the older couple could have chosen seats where they wouldn't be blocked. However, the fact that the author was asked to sit multiple times and ignored requests, leading to escalation, suggests some fault. The author's defense is that others were standing too, but that doesn't absolve them from causing a blockage. \n\nAlso, the young couple behind apologized, indicating they felt pressured. The author's response of giving a dirty look might have been uncalled for. So, while the author might feel they're just enjoying the concert, they did contribute to others' discomfort. The balance here is about consideration for others in a shared space. Maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like standing only when the front rows did, but since they were in the back, maybe their movement was unavoidable. However, the repeated requests to sit down, especially when the older couple was clearly frustrated, points to the author being in the wrong. So, answer A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
