It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThey went to an Elton John concert at Madison Square Garden. They were in the back section on risers. When the concert started, everyone in front stood up and they joined in. After the second song, people behind them (an older couple surrounded by younger couples) asked them to sit down. They complied during a slower song, asking the front rows to sit as well. Then, during \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood again with others, and the people behind got angry. The author refused to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" leading to the older couple getting upset. The young couple behind them later apologized, feeling pressured.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for standing up despite the requests. They argue that it's an Elton John concert, not like a concert with a pit, so maybe standing is expected. But the issue is that those behind them couldn't see the stage.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: venue setup, expectations of the audience, and respect for others. The venue had chairs on risers, implying they should stay seated. But when everyone stands, it's hard for people behind to see. The author was in the back, so standing up would block the view for those behind. The older couple was trying to watch the show without obstruction. The author chose to stand even when asked, which caused frustration. \n\nBut the author also tried to mediate by getting the front rows to sit during a slow song. However, during energetic songs, people naturally stand. It's a bit of a social dilemma. The author might think that since everyone else is standing, it's okay, but the people behind them have a right to see the performance. \n\nIn such cases, concert etiquette often suggests that if your standing blocks others, you should sit to maintain visibility. The fact that the venue provided chairs might imply that sitting is the norm. The author's refusal to comply, even after being asked, could be seen as inconsiderate. However, there's also the aspect of enjoying the concert in a way that's common in such events. \n\nI think the balance is on the side of the people who can't see. The author's actions directly affected others' enjoyment. Even though they tried to mediate once, the repeated refusal during key moments shows a lack of consideration. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
