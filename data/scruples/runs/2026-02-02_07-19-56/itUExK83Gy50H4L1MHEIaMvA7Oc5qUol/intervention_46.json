It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for standing up at a concert even though people behind them kept asking to sit down. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post, so I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the author and their group were in the back rows of a floor section at an Elton John concert. They stood up during the songs, which blocked the view for the people behind them. The older couple behind them, probably in a higher row because the seating is on risers, kept asking them to sit down. The author tried to accommodate during a slower song but then refused during \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" leading to frustration from the older couple. The author ends by arguing that since everyone else is standing, why shouldn't they be allowed to.\n\nSo, the key points here are: blocking the view, responding to requests, and whether the author's actions were considerate. \n\nTheater etiquette usually says that if your actions interfere with others' view, you should comply with their requests. However, concerts can be more flexible, especially if it's a standing crowd. The author might feel they have a right to enjoy the concert as others do. But the problem is they were in the back, and standing blocked the view for those behind them. The fact that the people in front were standing too suggests that maybe the author's blockage was part of a larger issue, but they were directly asked to sit down multiple times. \n\nThe older couple might have a valid point about their view being obstructed. However, the author tried to mediate by asking the front rows to sit down. But when the music was upbeat, everyone else stood again, making their blockage inevitable. The author's refusal to sit during \"Philadelphia Freedom\" could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the couple behind was getting upset. The sarcastic clapping and the dirty look might have escalated tensions, but the initial issue was about blocking the view.\n\nOn the flip side, the author argues that it's an Elton John concert where people stand up, and they shouldn't be penalized for participating. The concert setup with chairs might not be meant for strict sitting, especially if the audience is expected to stand. However, the seating arrangement on risers implies that each row is higher than the one behind, so standing in a back row would block those behind. \n\nThe author did make an effort by sitting during slower songs but then chose to stand again during the more energetic ones. The fact that the young couple behind them apologized suggests that the author's actions were not entirely their fault, as others were pressuring the young couple as well. \n\nBut the core issue is whether standing up was reasonable given the requests. The author's position is that they were following the crowd, but the people behind them were in a worse position because the author's row was blocking them. Even if others in front were standing, the author's proximity to the back rows might mean their blockage is more significant. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, maybe the author should have found a way to compromise more, perhaps by standing less during key parts or ensuring they didn't block. However, the author was doing what the majority did, which complicates things. The answer might depend on cultural norms about concert behavior. If the concert expects people to stand during songs, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if they were in a section where sitting is expected, then standing might be problematic. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But considering the concert's dynamic and the fact that others were doing the same, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, repeatedly ignoring requests to sit down, especially when it directly affects others' view, could make them at fault. So, the answer is a bit nuanced. But in the AITA context, the standard is usually about whether the person acted unreasonably. The author did try to accommodate but then refused, leading to conflict. So, maybe the author is partially at fault. But given that the people behind were also influenced by others, perhaps the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nThe user's initial thought is A (yes, in the wrong), but after considering both sides, maybe the answer is a mix. However, AITA usually expects a clear A or B. If the main issue is blocking the view despite being asked, then A. If the concert culture allows for standing, then B. Since the author was in a back row on a riser, standing would block the people behind, making their requests valid. So, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the requests, even if others were doing the same. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
