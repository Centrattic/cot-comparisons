It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a concert where they stood up to dance, even though people behind them asked them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They were at an Elton John concert, seated in a section with risers. When the music started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined in. The people behind, an older couple and others, were upset because they couldn't see the stage. The author tried to mediate by making the front rows sit down, but then during \"Tiny Dancer,\" they stood again despite being asked. The older couple got angry, and there was some clapping and a dirty look. The author kept standing for upbeat songs, and later the young couple apologized, saying they felt pressured.\n\nNow, the key points here are about etiquette and respecting others' views. Concert venues often have different expectations. In this case, the seating was on risers, which are designed to provide a good view. However, when people stand, it can block the view for those behind. The author's argument is that everyone else was standing, so they should be allowed to as well. But the problem arises when their standing blocks the view of others, especially if they're in a back section. \n\nThe author did try to sit down during a slower song, showing some consideration. But when the music got more upbeat, they stood again. This back-and-forth might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the people behind were persistently asking. The fact that the young couple behind them later apologized suggests that the older couple's pressure was influencing others, but the author's refusal could be seen as standing up for their own enjoyment.\n\nIn terms of concert etiquette, it's generally expected that if your actions (like standing) block others, you should accommodate their need to see. However, in some concerts, especially with lively music, standing is part of the experience. The venue's setup also matters. If the chairs are on risers, they're supposed to help with sightlines. If people stand, even if everyone else does, it's a problem for those behind. So the author might be in the wrong for not consistently keeping their seats when asked, despite the general crowd behavior.\n\nBut there's a balance. The author isn't the only ones standing; the people in front are too. The venue might have expected some standing. However, the people behind had a valid complaint about not seeing. The author's actions contributed to that issue, even if others were doing the same. So the answer might hinge on whether the author's standing was the primary cause of the problem or just part of a larger crowd dynamic. The fact that they tried to mediate once shows some consideration, but then continued to stand when asked again. The older couple's frustration is understandable, so the author might be partially at fault. However, the concert's nature could support their actions. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they ignored direct requests that impacted others' experience.\n"
