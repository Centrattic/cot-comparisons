It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about standing up at an Elton John concert despite requests from people behind them to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their group were in the back sections of a floor seating area with risers. When the concert started, everyone in front stood up, so they joined. The people behind (an older couple and others) asked them to sit so they could see. They tried to sit during a slow song but then stood again for another song. The older couple got angry, and the author refused to sit during a popular song. Eventually, some people clapped sarcastically, and the author gave them a dirty look.\n\nSo, the main issue is blocking the view for people behind. Theaters and concerts usually expect you to stay seated so others can have a good view. Even if others are standing, if you're in a seated area, you might be blocking the view for those behind you. The author's reasoning is that everyone else is standing, so why not them? But the problem is their position on the risers\u2014sitting there would leave space for people behind to see over. If they stand, they block the view. So the people behind have a right to request them to sit.\n\nThe author tried to compromise initially by sitting during a slow song but then stood again. The older couple got frustrated, which led to tension. The author's argument is that it's a concert where people naturally stand to dance, but the venue provided chairs, implying that sitting is the norm. Also, the young couple behind them eventually apologized, saying they felt pressured by the older crowd. That suggests that the older group was exerting social pressure, which might not be fair, but the author's actions could still be problematic because they were blocking others.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be partially at fault. They were in a seated area, and by standing, they were creating a view block for others. The concert organizers might expect seated spectators to stay seated to maintain visibility. However, the people behind shouldn't have yelled at them; they could have escalated to staff. The author also didn't consider the impact of their actions on others, even after being asked. So, while the older couple's behavior was harsh, the author's decision to stand repeatedly despite being asked to sit is inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the seating arrangement meant to ensure everyone's view.\n"
