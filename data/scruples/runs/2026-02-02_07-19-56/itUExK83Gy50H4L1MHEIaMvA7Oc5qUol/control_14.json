It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a concert where they stood up despite people behind them asking to sit down.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The concert had a floor seating area with risers, so the people behind were on the same level. When the concert started, the crowd stood up, including the author. The older couple behind them got upset because the standing audience blocked their view. The author initially sat down during a slower song, but when the music picked up again, they stood back up. The older couple got angry, and sarcastic clapping happened. The author felt it was their right to stand and enjoy the music, especially since everyone else was doing it.\n\nThe key points here are about concert etiquette, blocking views, and respecting others' experience. In many concerts, especially with seated sections, there are rules against standing to prevent blocking. However, in this case, the seats were on risers, which might be designed to allow some standing. The people behind the author were in a different section, maybe not designed for standing. The author's actions could have obstructed the older couple's view, which is a common issue in concerts. \n\nThe author tried to compromise by sitting during slower songs, but when the music was upbeat, people naturally stood again. The older couple's frustration is understandable because they paid for seats and couldn't see the stage. However, the author might argue that the concert environment encourages movement, especially for Elton John's energy.\n\nBut concert etiquette usually respects the paid seats. If the venue has seating, there's an expectation that people will remain seated to allow others in the back to see. Standing up in a seated section can be considered rude because it blocks the view for those who paid for that specific spot. The fact that others in front were standing might not excuse it if the seating is meant to be for sitting. \n\nThe author's refusal to sit down despite multiple requests shows a lack of consideration for the couple's experience. While it's understandable to want to enjoy the music, blocking others' views violates concert etiquette. The sarcastic clapping and dirty look add to the conflict, but the root issue is the blocking. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the seating arrangement's purpose, leading to a better experience for those behind them.\n"
