It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they\u2019re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. \n\nI was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton\u2019s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. \n\nWell, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. \n\nThe older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. \n\nSo, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.\n\nIt\u2019s an Elton John concert. True, it\u2019s not the kind of music that you\u2019d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn\u2019t we be allowed to?\n\nAITA for standing up at this concert, despite the people behind me asking me to sit down?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an Elton John concert where they were sitting on the floor in a section with risers. When the concert started, they stood up with the people in front to dance, but people behind them (an older couple and others) kept asking them to sit down. The author tried to comply during a slower song, but then when the music picked up again, they stood again. The older couple got angry and started clapping sarcastically. The author ends up not sitting for most of the show and ends up with a dirty look at the couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider concert etiquette. In general, if you buy a seat, you're supposed to stay in your seat to not block the view for others behind you. However, concerts can be different. Some concerts encourage dancing or standing, especially if the venue allows for it. But in this case, the seats are on risers, which are designed to give everyone a good view. If the author and the people in front are standing, they might block the view for those behind. The author tried to sit during a slower song, but when the music got more upbeat again, they stood again. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author's actions were reasonable. They were in a seated area but chose to stand up when others did. The problem arises when their standing blocks the view of those behind them. The people behind have a right to an unobstructed view, especially if they paid for seats. However, if the concert is more about dancing, maybe the venue expects some movement. But in this case, the author was in a seated section, so maybe they should have stayed seated to avoid blocking.\n\nAlso, the author did try to comply once when the song was slower, but then decided to stand again during a popular song. The argument is that if everyone else is standing, it's okay, but that could create a domino effect where people in front keep standing, blocking views. The couple behind was surrounded by younger couples, so maybe there was some generational difference in concert behavior. The older couple might prefer a seated experience, while the younger crowd is more into dancing.\n\nThe author's justification is that it's an Elton John concert, and the music is meant to dance to. However, the venue provided chairs, indicating an expectation for seated viewing. So, even if the music is danceable, the seating arrangement might imply that people should stay seated to maintain the view for others. The author's refusal to sit down despite requests could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they were in a position where their standing would block others' views.\n\nOn the other hand, if the crowd in front is standing, maybe it's expected that the entire section should stand. But the problem is that the author is in a back section, so their standing might not block the front rows, but the people behind them (the older couple) can't see over them. This is a common issue in concerts where people in the back rows need the front rows to stay seated. If the author and those in front are standing, they block the view. The author tried to mediate by getting the front rows to sit, but then reverted when the song changed.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be a mix of trying to be respectful but then not following through. They did sit once, but not consistently. The older couple's frustration is understandable because they are in the back and can't see over the people in front. The author's refusal to sit during a popular song could be seen as prioritizing their own enjoyment over the comfort of others who paid for seats behind them. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they contributed to the view obstruction even after being asked to sit down. It's a balance between personal enjoyment and respecting others' experience.\n"
