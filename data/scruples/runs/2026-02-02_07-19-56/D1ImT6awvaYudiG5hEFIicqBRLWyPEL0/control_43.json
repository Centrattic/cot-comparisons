I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for asking their girlfriend to show her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and the guy asked to see her birth control pills as proof she was using it. The girlfriend got upset, the mood was ruined, they didn't talk for the night, and she's still not talking the next day. The guy says he's paranoid and wants visual evidence because he doesn't want kids and she's on the fence about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had already discussed the topic of children early on, so maybe she mentioned she's on birth control then. The guy is seeking reassurance, but his approach was to ask for proof, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Birth control is a personal health matter, and people might consider that a private issue. Even if they discussed it before, asking to see the actual pills might come off as distrustful or controlling. \n\nIn relationships, trust is a big component. If they had already talked about it, maybe the guy could have trusted her word instead of asking for proof. However, if the guy has valid concerns about his partner's honesty or if there's a history of dishonesty, maybe his request isn't entirely unreasonable. But in this case, the story doesn't mention any prior reasons to doubt her. \n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. The girlfriend has the right to make her own healthcare decisions, and her choice to use birth control is her personal business. Asking to see it during an intimate moment might be perceived as pressuring her or not respecting her privacy. It's possible that his request felt like an invasion of her privacy, which could explain her being upset and not wanting to talk.\n\nThe guy also mentions he's paranoid, which might indicate he has anxiety or trust issues. While that's valid, acting on those feelings in a way that makes his partner uncomfortable is problematic. The key issue here is whether his request was justified given the context. Since they had already discussed it, maybe he should have trusted her unless there was a specific reason not to. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's worried about not wanting children and she's on the fence, maybe she's using birth control inconsistently, and he's trying to make sure. But instead of a direct ask, open communication would be better. \n\nIn conclusion, while his intent might be to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, the method he used (asking to see the pills) was likely disrespectful and undermined trust. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her privacy and the trust established in their prior conversation. The right approach would be to discuss the concerns openly and not demand proof.\n"
