I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a guy (23) and his girlfriend (21) has been in a relationship for 11 months. They were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control. The key points here are about trust, communication, and consent.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they had a discussion about birth control very early in the relationship. The girlfriend is on the fence about having children, and he doesn't want kids. So, he's trying to make sure that she's actually using birth control, which he finds important. But he asked to see it, which she didn't like, and it killed the mood. Now there's silence from her the next day.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether asking to see her birth control is a reasonable request or if it's overstepping. On one hand, it's about safety and ensuring that both parties are on the same page regarding contraception. It's a serious matter, and wanting to confirm that she's using it could be seen as responsible. But on the other hand, birth control is a personal and private issue. Even if they talked about it early on, asking to see the actual pill pack might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nI should consider the context of their relationship. They've been together 11 months, and she's on the fence about kids. That suggests she might be considering different options, but the author is clear he doesn't want any. If they already discussed it, he should trust her word. However, he wanted \"visual evidence,\" which might not be necessary if the conversation was clear. Maybe he's more controlling or lacks trust, which can be a red flag. \n\nBut wait, in some cases, people might genuinely want to confirm due to past experiences or anxiety. However, the method of asking to see it might be problematic. It could come off as distrustful. If she's on the pill, she probably knows to take it properly, and he can trust her to do so. Alternatively, maybe he's not aware that she might be using other forms of contraception not visible in a pill pack, like an IUD or implant. \n\nAlso, the act of asking during a romantic moment might have been inappropriate. Timing is important in communication. Instead of asking during that intimate moment, maybe he should have discussed it another time. That might have been less awkward and more respectful. \n\nSo, was he in the wrong? It seems like he was trying to be cautious, but the way he approached it could have been better. If they already had the conversation and she said she's on the pill, he might be overstepping by demanding to see it. Trust is a big part of any relationship, and constant verification can erode that trust. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because asking to see her birth control could be seen as distrustful and invasive, even if his intention was to prevent pregnancy. There are other ways to ensure safety, like using a condom or discussing it more openly without checking her personal medication. However, some might argue that he's being responsible, but the method here is the issue.\n"
