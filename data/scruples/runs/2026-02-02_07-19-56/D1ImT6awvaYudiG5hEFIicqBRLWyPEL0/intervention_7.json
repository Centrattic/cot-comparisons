I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The guy is 23, his girlfriend is 21, and they've been together for 11 months. They were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control. The reason he's asking is because he doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. He mentions they discussed this early on, but he wanted visual proof. After he asked to see it, the mood was ruined, and they didn't talk for the rest of the night. Now she's still not talking to him.\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust and communication. He says he's paranoid, so he's looking for evidence of honesty. But if they had already discussed this, maybe he should have trusted her word instead of demanding proof. Trust is a big part of any relationship, right? If he doesn't trust her, that could be a problem. Also, asking to see the actual birth control might come off as intrusive or not respecting her privacy. She might feel like he's doubting her honesty without a good reason. \n\nHowever, he does mention that he's not ready for kids and wants to avoid pregnancy. That's a valid concern. But the way he approached it might have been the issue. Instead of just asking if she was on birth control, which she already confirmed, he wanted to see the physical proof. That could be seen as overstepping. Maybe a better approach would have been to discuss their feelings again and find a mutual agreement rather than questioning her honesty after the fact.\n\nAlso, the fact that this led to them not talking for the rest of the night and the next day suggests that his action was off-putting to her. If a request like that breaks the mood and causes a rift, it might indicate that he didn't consider her feelings or the context. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries and communication styles is crucial. He might have prioritized his fear of pregnancy over her comfort and trust in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's request for visual proof, even if\u51fa\u4e8e concern, could be seen as a breach of trust and an invasion of privacy. The right approach would have been to have an open conversation and ensure both parties are on the same page, rather than demanding proof. Therefore, I think the author is in the wrong.\n"
