I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control for the first time they were about to have sex. The question is whether his action was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy mentions they had discussed the issue of children early in their relationship. He states he doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. So there's a pre-existing discussion about their future plans. However, when it comes to the first time having sex, he wants visual confirmation of her birth control use.\n\nNow, what's the issue here? The key points are trust and communication. The author is asking to see her birth control, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if they discussed it before, asking for proof might imply he doesn't fully trust her honesty. In relationships, trust is crucial. If he had trust issues from the start, that could be a problem. But he also has a valid concern about not wanting children, so his motives are about preventing an unintended pregnancy.\n\nBut why ask for visual proof? Birth control can vary (pills, IUDs, implants), and seeing a pill might not be sufficient. Also, she could be using a different method not visible to him. Additionally, the timing of the request\u2014right before sex\u2014might have been awkward and stressful for her. The fact that it killed the mood and led to a breakdown in communication suggests that she felt disrespected or mistrusted.\n\nOn the other hand, he has a right to be cautious about his reproductive future. But the way he approached it might have been inconsiderate. Instead of asking to see the birth control, maybe he could have discussed his concerns more openly, ensuring they both agreed on a method. If he already knew she was on the fence about kids, maybe they should have had a more detailed conversation about contraceptive methods they both felt comfortable with.\n\nSo, the author's action was probably a breach of trust. Even if his intention was to avoid a pregnancy, demanding proof without discussing it beforehand could be seen as controlling or not respecting her privacy. The appropriate step would have been to have an open dialogue about their birth control plans rather than a sudden request for evidence. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with trust and respect.\n"
