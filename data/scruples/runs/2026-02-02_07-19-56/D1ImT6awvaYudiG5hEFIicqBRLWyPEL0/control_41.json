I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're a couple, 11 months into the relationship. The guy is 23, the girl 21. They were about to have sex, and he asked her to show him her birth control. He doesn't want kids, she's on the fence. He wanted visual proof of her honesty. Now she's upset and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust and consent. The guy's action might be seen as a breach of trust. Trust is important in relationships, and asking to see her birth control could come off as distrustful. Even if he had good intentions, like being cautious about not having kids, the way he approached it might have been too intrusive. It's her personal information and medical history, which is private.\n\nAlso, they already discussed the topic early in the relationship. If she said she's on birth control, maybe he should take her word for it. By asking to see the physical proof, he might be overstepping. It's possible he's being controlling or not respecting her boundaries. Even if he's paranoid, that doesn't justify violating her privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, he might genuinely have concerns about unintended pregnancy. But communication is key. Instead of demanding to see the pills, maybe he should have discussed his concerns again, reaffirmed their previous agreement, or suggested using a condom as an extra precaution. The fact that he went ahead and used a condom shows he's taking responsibility, but the act of asking to see her BC was probably too much.\n\nAnother angle: birth control is a personal choice and medical matter. People might feel uncomfortable sharing that with a partner, even a significant one. It's private, and expecting someone to show it could be seen as disrespectful. The fact that it ruined the mood and led to conflict suggests she felt disrespected or mistrusted.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). He didn't respect her privacy and trust, which is crucial in a relationship. He should have trusted her word from their earlier discussion and communicated his concerns differently.\n"
