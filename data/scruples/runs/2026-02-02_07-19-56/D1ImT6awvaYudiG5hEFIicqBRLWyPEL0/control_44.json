I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to see their girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, and the guy asked to see the pill or something to confirm she's on it. The GF was upset, mood killed, and didn't talk afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They mentioned they had this discussion early in the relationship. So maybe he already knows she's using it, but he's still asking to see it. The guy doesn't want children, and she's on the fence. Even if they had the talk, it's a big deal for him to want proof. \n\nBirth control is a personal matter, and asking to see it can be seen as intrusive. Trust is a key part of any relationship. If she said she's using it and he already knows from prior discussions, demanding to see the physical evidence might come off as distrustful. That could hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's concern is valid. He doesn't want kids, and she's uncertain. So maybe he's just trying to ensure there's no risk. But the way he approached it might have been too abrupt. Instead of asking to see it during a private moment, maybe a more open conversation would have been better. \n\nThe fact that it killed the mood and she didn't talk to him the next day suggests it was a big deal. The guy might have overstepped by not respecting her privacy. There's a balance between being cautious and respecting boundaries. \n\nAlso, the age difference is slight\u201423 and 21. But maturity levels can vary. Some people might find this request too pushy, others might understand the concern. However, the main issue here is about trust and consent. If he's in a relationship where he's already established that they'll use protection, asking to see her method during intimacy might be seen as violating her trust. \n\nSo considering all points, the answer is likely A: Yes, the author is in the wrong because he didn't trust his partner and made a private matter uncomfortable. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the action seems to cross a boundary. So I'll go with A.\n"
