I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to show her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and the author wanted to confirm she was on birth control because he doesn't want kids. He asked her to show proof, which made her upset.\n\nHmm. First, they had already discussed birth control early in their 11-month relationship. The author mentions being paranoid and wanting visual evidence. But trust is important in a relationship. If they had already talked about it, maybe he should trust her word. Asking for proof might come off as distrustful, even if he has valid reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not using a condom, relying on her birth control, so he has a legitimate concern about pregnancy. But instead of just trusting her, he asked to see the pill pack. That could make her feel like he doesn't trust her honesty. Even if his intention was to ensure safety, the way he approached it might have been hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her privacy was invaded or that he's not respecting her autonomy. Birth control is a personal medical decision, and showing her pill pack is personal. Maybe he should have trusted her if they had already discussed it and she said she's on it. His reaction might have been overstepping, leading to the argument and her not talking to him.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's action of asking for proof after the discussion might be seen as distrustful. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
