I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control during a moment when they were about to have sex. The guy doesn't want kids, and they discussed it early on. But when he asked to see the birth control, it ruined the mood, and they didn't talk after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Trust is a big part of relationships. The guy is concerned about not wanting kids and wants assurance. But asking to see the birth control might come across as distrustful. Even if they had discussed it before, the way he approached it was during a vulnerable moment, which could be seen as invasive or not respecting her privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, he might be trying to ensure they're both on the same page. But the method of asking during a sexual moment might not be the best approach. Maybe a more open and non-confrontational conversation would have been better. Also, the fact that it killed the mood and caused a breakdown in communication suggests that his approach might have been off.\n\nSome might argue that he had the right to be cautious, but the way he did it could be seen as overstepping. The answer likely hinges on whether the request was made in a respectful manner and the context of their relationship. Since they had discussed it before, maybe he should have trusted her word. Insisting on visual proof might not be necessary and could damage trust. So, the answer is probably A, he's in the wrong.\n"
