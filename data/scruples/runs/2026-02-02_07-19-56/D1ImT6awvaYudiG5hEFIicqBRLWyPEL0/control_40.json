      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is \"in the wrong\" for asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author (23M) and his girlfriend (21F) have been in a relationship for 11 months. They were about to have sex for the first time (or maybe the first time without a condom?), and he was putting on a condom. He asked if she was on birth control. He doesn't want kids, and she's \"on the fence\" about it. They discussed this early in the relationship. But he wanted \"visual evidence\" of her honesty, so he asked to see her birth control. That killed the mood, and they didn't talk the rest of the night. Now she hasn't responded the next day. He's asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nThe key points here are about trust and communication. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be honest about their contraceptive use. The author had already discussed this with her before, so maybe he felt uncertain. But asking to see her birth control could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of faith in her honesty. Even if he was concerned, demanding to see proof might come off as controlling or distrustful. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that not wanting children is a significant issue, and ensuring that both parties are on the same page is crucial. If the author felt that her previous answers weren't sufficient, maybe he should have asked more questions or revisited the conversation instead of insisting on seeing the physical evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, if she was honest before and he suddenly wanted proof, that could make her feel disrespected. Trust is a foundational element in relationships. If he didn't trust her, that might be a red flag for her. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the dynamics here. If the discussion was early on and they had agreed on using birth control, maybe he should have taken her word. But if he felt she was unsure or if there were previous issues with honesty, then maybe his request was valid. However, the way he approached it\u2014asking to see it at that moment when they were intimate\u2014might be seen as confrontational or distrustful. \n\nIn most cases, asking to see a partner's birth control can be perceived as an invasion of privacy, even if the intention is to avoid pregnancy. The right approach would be open communication and mutual agreement on methods, not demanding proof. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't trust her and acted on that during a vulnerable moment, which could be seen as disrespectful. So the answer is A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
