I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a guy asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. Let me think about the key points.\n\nFirst, they've been together for 11 months and are both young. The guy doesn't want kids, and the girl is on the fence. They had discussed this before. Now, when they're about to have sex for the first time, he asks to see her birth control. That's when things go south.\n\nHmm, trust is a big part of relationships. The guy might feel insecure or want proof, but asking to see her birth control seems like an invasion of privacy. Even if they discussed it before, maybe he overstepped. Birth control is a personal health matter, and expecting to see physical proof could be seen as distrustful. It's not just about the act of checking but the underlying implication that he doesn't trust her word.\n\nThe girl's reaction was that the mood was killed, and she didn't talk to him the next day. That suggests she felt hurt or disrespected. Communication is key here. Instead of asking for proof, maybe he should have discussed his concerns again or ensured they were on the same page about using dual protection (condom plus birth control). His approach might have come across as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nAlso, considering their age and relationship length, they might still be navigating boundaries. The guy's action, while stemming from a place of wanting to avoid pregnancy, could have been handled more sensitively. Trust should be based on verbal agreement, not physical proof. So, in this context, the author might be at fault for not respecting her privacy and for a lack of trust, leading to the conflict.\n"
