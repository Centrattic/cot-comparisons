I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy, 23, with a girlfriend who is 21, in a relationship for 11 months. They were getting naked and wrestling, and he was putting on a condom. He asked her about birth control because he doesn't want kids in the future, and she's on the fence. They had discussed this early on. The key part is when he asked to see her birth control, which made her lose the mood, and they didn't talk the rest of the night. Now she's still not talking to him the next day. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for asking to see her birth control.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Birth control is a personal and private matter. While the author has valid concerns about not wanting children and ensuring protection, demanding to see the physical birth control might come off as distrustful. Even if they had discussed it before, asking for visual proof can be seen as invasive. It's possible that the author's approach was more about verifying her honesty rather than a genuine need for current protection, especially since they were using a condom. That might have made her feel like he doesn't trust her, which is a big issue in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overthinking. Maybe he just wanted to confirm that she was actually on birth control as they discussed. However, the method of confirming by seeing it during a moment of intimacy could be inappropriate. Trust is crucial, and such a request might undermine that trust. If the girlfriend felt that he didn't believe her word, that could explain her reaction. Even if the author's intention was to be cautious, the way he approached it might have been wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend is 21, and the relationship is 11 months. They had already discussed the issue before. If she said she's on the fence, maybe she's not on birth control. But the author might not know if she's being truthful. However, instead of demanding to see it, a better approach would be to discuss the issue again, ensure mutual understanding, and perhaps agree on a method that works for both. Using a condom as they did shows they are taking precautions, so maybe the author's request was unnecessary.\n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries, asking to see someone's medical information or personal items like birth control pills is a privacy invasion. Even if it's for a reason, it's not a standard practice. Trust should be based on communication, not physical proof. So the author's actions might be crossing a boundary, leading to the breakup or cold shoulder from the girlfriend.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author is concerned about not wanting children and wants to be sure. But if they're using a condom, maybe the birth control is redundant. However, if the girlfriend isn't on birth control, maybe she's not as committed to the discussion as she said. But the author's method of checking is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be understandable, the act of asking to see her birth control is a breach of trust and privacy. It's more about control or distrust rather than a genuine need. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
