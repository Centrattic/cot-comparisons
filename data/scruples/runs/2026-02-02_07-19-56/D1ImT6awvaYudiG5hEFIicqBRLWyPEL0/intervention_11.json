I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking to see his girlfriend's birth control. The scenario is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and during the process of putting on a condom, he asked if she's on birth control. He mentions he doesn't want kids in the future, but she's on the fence, and they discussed this early on. The key point is that he wanted \"visual evidence\" of her honesty, which led to her being upset and them not talking.\n\nFirst, trust is crucial in a relationship. The author is seeking reassurance, which is understandable, but his method of doing so might not be healthy. Asking to see the actual birth control could be seen as invasive and a breach of trust. Even though they had discussed this before, his need for visual proof suggests a lack of trust in her word, which can be hurtful. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or not trusted, especially since they had already talked about it. \n\nAlso, bringing this up in the moment of intimacy could be seen as the wrong time for such a request. It might have made her feel like he wasn't respecting her or the previous conversation. The fact that it killed the mood and led to them not talking the next day shows the impact of his action. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about not wanting children is valid, and he's trying to protect himself. However, the approach taken here could have been better handled. Instead of asking to see the physical evidence, a more open and trusting dialogue would have been better. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action of demanding to see the birth control likely hurt the girlfriend's feelings and undermined the trust they had built. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
