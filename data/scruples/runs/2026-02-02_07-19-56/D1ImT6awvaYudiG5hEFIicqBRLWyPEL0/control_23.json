      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 23-year-old male in an 11-month relationship with his 21-year-old girlfriend. They were getting naked to wrestle, and when putting on a condom, he asked if she was on birth control. He doesn't want children in the future, but she's on the fence. They had talked about this early on. The key part is that he wanted visual evidence of her using birth control because it was their first time sleeping together. He asked to see it, which killed the mood, and they didn't talk for the rest of the night. She hasn't talked to him the next day either. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had discussed birth control early in the relationship, so maybe she already mentioned she wasn't on it. But the author wanted to verify, perhaps because he's concerned about unintended pregnancy. However, asking to see the birth control might be seen as intrusive or not trusting her. Trust is a big part of relationships. If they had already talked about it, maybe he should have trusted her word instead of demanding visual proof. \n\nOn the other hand, he might feel that without proof, he's taking a risk. But in a trusting relationship, trust is important. If he needed evidence, that could indicate a lack of trust, which might be hurtful to her. Also, the situation was intimate, and bringing up such a request during a romantic moment could have been awkward or off-putting. \n\nAnother angle is communication. They had discussed the topic before, so maybe he should have addressed his concerns in a non-confrontational way earlier rather than at the moment of intimacy. The fact that he waited until they were about to sleep together to ask for proof might have made her feel pressured or not respected. \n\nHer reaction was negative, which suggests that his request was hurtful or untrustworthy in her eyes. Even if his intentions were to make sure, the method might have been inappropriate. Trust issues can cause a lot of tension, and asking for proof could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, considering that he doesn't want children and she's on the fence, there's a valid concern about contraception. But using a condom as backup is a standard practice. Maybe he could have used the condom regardless, but he wanted to confirm her birth control use. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He has a legitimate concern about unintended pregnancy, but the way he addressed it might have been too direct or lacking in trust. Relationships require both communication and trust. If he had already discussed the topic and she said she's on birth control, he might need to trust her unless there's a reason to doubt her. \n\nAlternatively, if he felt uncertain, maybe he should have discussed it more openly before the encounter rather than making a demand during the moment. His actions might have come off as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't trust her after they had discussed the issue, leading to a breach of trust and damaging the moment. Therefore, the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
