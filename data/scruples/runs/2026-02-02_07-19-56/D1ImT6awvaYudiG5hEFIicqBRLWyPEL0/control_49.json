I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show her birth control. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been in a relationship for 11 months. The guy is 23, the girl is 21. They were about to have sex, and he asked her to show her birth control. He doesn't want kids, she's on the fence. He mentions they discussed this early on, but he wanted visual proof. Now she's upset, the mood is ruined, and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm. So, trust is a big part of relationships. He says he's \"paranoid,\" but maybe that's just his way of saying he's concerned about her honesty. But is asking for proof of birth control a reasonable request? Well, they already discussed it, so maybe he should trust her word instead of needing to see it. Birth control comes in forms like pills, patches, IUDs. She might not carry the pills around, so showing them might not be practical. Plus, even if she is on the pill, that's her personal information and her choice to share. Requiring her to show it could be seen as controlling or not trusting her, which can be a big turn-off. \n\nHe says he's worried about future children, but she's on the fence. Maybe the bigger issue is their differing views on having kids, but he's focusing on the birth control as a way to manage that. However, by asking for proof, he's making it about her rather than addressing their own differing perspectives. It might be more about his need for control than the actual risk. \n\nAlso, the fact that it killed the mood and she hasn't talked to him since suggests that she felt disrespected or not trusted. In relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner feels that their honesty isn't being trusted, it can lead to bigger issues. So, the author's action might have been a breach of trust. \n\nBut wait, maybe he had a valid reason. If he's really not okay with kids, maybe he's justified in wanting to make sure. However, the way he did it could be problematic. Trusting her word and using other forms of protection (like condoms) might be a better approach. Combining both methods (condom + birth control) is common for effectiveness, but he's already using a condom. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong because he didn't trust her word after they had discussed it. He should have addressed his concerns about the future children discussion instead of making her prove her birth control use. His action might have been more about his discomfort than her actual risk.\n"
