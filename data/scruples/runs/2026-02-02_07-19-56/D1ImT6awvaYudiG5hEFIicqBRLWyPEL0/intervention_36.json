I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a guy in a 11-month relationship with his 21-year-old girlfriend, asked to see her birth control during a moment when they were about to have sex. The key points are: he doesn't want kids, she's unsure, they discussed this early on, and now he's upset because she's been silent after he asked to see the evidence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and trust in a relationship. Asking for proof of birth control use might seem like an overstep. Birth control is a personal health matter, and while it's important for avoiding pregnancy, demanding to see it can come off as distrustful. Even if they had discussed it before, the way he approached it\u2014during a intimate moment\u2014could have been inappropriate. It might have made her feel like he didn't trust her, leading to the mood being ruined and the communication breakdown.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about not wanting children is valid, so his intention wasn't malicious. But the method of addressing it might have been wrong. Instead of asking to see it, maybe discussing it more calmly or ensuring there's mutual agreement on contraception methods in advance would have been better. The fact that he went from discussing to demanding proof during a sexual moment could have been too much, making her feel pressured or disrespected.\n\nAlso, the timing of the request might have been awkward. During a moment when they're both aroused and about to have sex, bringing up such a concrete request could be seen as inconsiderate. It's possible he didn't consider how this would affect her emotionally or the intimacy of the situation.\n\nIn relationships, trust is key. If the author didn't trust her honesty, maybe the real issue is his trust, not just the act of asking for proof. However, the act itself can be seen as an invasion of privacy. So, even if his intentions were good, the action might have crossed a line.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were a breach of privacy and trust, which led to a negative outcome. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
