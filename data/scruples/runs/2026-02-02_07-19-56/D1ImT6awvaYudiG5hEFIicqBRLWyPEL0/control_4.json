I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to see his girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they've been dating 11 months, she's 21 and he's 23. They were about to have sex, he asked if she was on birth control because he doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. He wanted to see proof, but that ruined the mood and they didn't talk the next day.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether he's wrong for asking. Let's break it down. First, he had a conversation early on about not wanting kids, and she's aware. Now, he's asking for visual confirmation. Is that reasonable?\n\nWell, trust is important in relationships. If he already discussed this, maybe he's doubting her honesty. But why would he need proof? Maybe he's insecure or wants to be sure she's not lying. But asking to see the pills might come across as invasive or not trusting her. She might feel disrespected because it's a personal medical matter. Birth control is a private thing, and showing the actual pills could be a privacy issue. \n\nOn the other hand, he has valid concerns about an unplanned pregnancy. If they're having sex, using contraception is important. But instead of asking to see the pills, maybe a better approach would be to have an open conversation about her commitment to using birth control and maybe use a backup method like condoms. \n\nHe did use a condom, which is good, but his need for visual proof might have been the problem. Trusting his partner is key, and making her show her pills could undermine that trust. Also, she's 21 and might feel that he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A, that he's at fault. He should have trusted her based on their previous discussion. However, his concern isn't invalid. It's a balance between being cautious and respecting her privacy. But the way he went about it was intrusive. So I think the answer is A.\n"
