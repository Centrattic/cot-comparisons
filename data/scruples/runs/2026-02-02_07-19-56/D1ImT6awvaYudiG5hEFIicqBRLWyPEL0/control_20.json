I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see his girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control as a way to verify her honesty, even though they had discussed it before. The girlfriend was upset, and it ruined the mood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider trust in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental aspect. If the girl had already told him she's on birth control, he's asking for proof, which might be seen as distrust. Even if he's concerned about future children, trusting her word is usually expected unless there's a reason to doubt her.\n\nSecond, communication. They had discussed this early on, so he should have felt confident in her answer. Asking to see the physical evidence might be overstepping. It's important to respect each other's privacy and autonomy. Birth control is a personal medical choice, and requiring proof can feel intrusive.\n\nThird, the impact of his action. The girlfriend was upset, and they didn't talk for the rest of the night. The author might be missing the emotional impact of his request. Even if his intention was to avoid an unwanted pregnancy, the way he approached it caused a rift.\n\nAlso, consent and mutual agreement on birth control methods are key. They could have discussed alternative methods like using a condom together to cover both their needs, which might have been a better approach than demanding proof.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid in terms of avoiding pregnancy. But the method of addressing it was problematic. Trust should be the foundation here. If he's not trusting her, that's a bigger issue. The fact that they had the conversation before but he still wanted to see it might indicate underlying trust issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't trust her word, which is essential in a relationship. His action was intrusive and damaged the mood and communication between them. The right approach would have been to discuss their concerns openly and find a mutually agreeable solution without demanding proof.\n"
