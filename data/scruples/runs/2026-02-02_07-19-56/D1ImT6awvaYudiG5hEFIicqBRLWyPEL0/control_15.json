      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA) for wanting to see their girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and while putting on a condom, they asked to see her birth control pills. The girlfriend was upset, the mood was ruined, they didn't talk that night, and she's still not responding the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is 23, GF is 21, 11-month relationship. They had discussed the topic of children early on, and the user doesn't want kids, but the GF is on the fence. The user's main concern is about trust and ensuring her honesty. So, they asked to see her birth control, which is a common method to prevent pregnancy. However, the GF was hurt by the request, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. Birth control is a personal health matter, and while it's important for preventing pregnancy, it's also private. The user had already discussed the issue with her, so maybe he trusted her at that point. But he wanted visual confirmation, which might come off as distrustful. In relationships, trust is crucial. If you need to see the pill pack, that could imply suspicion, which might be hurtful. However, his intention was to ensure they were on the same page and to have evidence of her honesty. \n\nOn the other hand, the GF's reaction is significant. If she felt that the request was a violation of her privacy, that's valid. People might feel uncomfortable showing personal medical items. Also, if they had already discussed it and she said she was on it, he might be overstepping by asking to see it physically. But if there was any doubt or if he wanted to confirm, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAnother angle: using a condom even though she's on the pill shows he's taking precautions. But then asking to see the pill might be redundant if he's using a condom as well. Maybe she felt he wasn't trusting her enough even when she provided verbal confirmation. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say that if you've already discussed it and she assured him, then asking to see the actual pill is unnecessary and shows a lack of trust. Others might argue that it's a valid concern given the importance of the issue. \n\nBut the key here is that the request ruined the mood and caused a conflict. The user's action, while possibly coming from a place of wanting to be safe, might have been seen as intrusive. The fact that they ended up not talking that night and she's still not responding suggests that the GF is hurt, which could mean the user's action was indeed a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong) because the request for visual evidence could be perceived as distrustful despite their earlier discussions. However, there's also the argument that he's being cautious. But given the negative outcome and the GF's reaction, the consensus might lean towards the user needing to trust her based on their prior conversation.\n"
