I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy asked his girlfriend to show him her birth control. They were about to have sex for the first time, and he wanted to make sure she was using it because he doesn't want kids. They had already discussed this before, so he was probably trying to confirm her honesty. But he wanted to see the actual pill or whatever she's on.\n\nHmm. The question is whether asking to see the birth control is wrong. Well, from his perspective, maybe he's being cautious. He doesn't want kids, and he's concerned about her honesty. But from her side, maybe she found that invasion of privacy. Birth control is a personal matter, and even if they discussed it before, asking to see it might feel like a lack of trust or pressure. It could be seen as a way to control or check up on her, which might make her uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, the fact that they had this discussion early on but he still felt the need to ask for visual proof could indicate he wasn't fully trusting her. Even if the intent was to prevent pregnancy, the method might be problematic. Trust is important in relationships, and if one partner feels they have to prove their compliance, that could hurt the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's not the only one at fault. If they had talked about it before, maybe she should have been more upfront if she was on the fence or if there were any issues with the birth control. But the main issue here is his action. Asking to see personal medical items might be crossing a boundary. It's a sensitive topic, and the way he approached it might have been inappropriate. \n\nI think the key points are trust, communication, and respect for privacy. Even if the intention was good, the method of checking could be seen as intrusive. So, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect her privacy and his lack of trust led to a breach in their relationship dynamics. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
