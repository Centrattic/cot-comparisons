I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see his girlfriend's birth control. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (a 23-year-old man) and his 21-year-old girlfriend have been in a relationship for 11 months. They were about to have sex for the first time, and during this moment, the author asked her to show him her birth control. The girlfriend was on the fence about having kids, and the author wanted to ensure she was honest, hence the request. This action killed the mood, and they didn't talk for the rest of the night. Now they're not communicating the next day.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the community's take. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author's main concern is about not wanting children and ensuring she's on birth control. They had discussed this earlier, but maybe he felt the need for confirmation. However, asking to see her birth control during a vulnerable, intimate moment might come off as distrustful or inconsiderate. Trust is crucial in relationships, and such a request can be seen as undermining her privacy or honesty, even if his intention was to confirm things. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that because the topic was discussed early on, he's justified in wanting reassurance. But in relationships, trust is a two-way street. If there are concerns about honesty, it's better to approach it through open communication rather than a direct request for evidence during a private moment. It's possible the girlfriend felt disrespected or not trusted, even if the author didn't mean it that way.\n\nAlso, the context is important. They were about to have sex for the first time, which is already a significant moment. Asking for proof of birth control might be perceived as a breach of trust, especially if the girlfriend had already communicated her stance. The author's need for \"visual evidence\" suggests a lack of trust in her word, which can be hurtful. \n\nIn many discussions around this topic, people often emphasize the importance of trust and communication. While it's valid to want to ensure both partners are on the same page regarding contraception, the method of asking to see it in that moment might not be the best approach. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that this action was a deal-breaker for her, which could imply that the author overstepped.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't approach the situation with trust and open dialogue but instead demanded proof during an intimate setting, which may have been disrespectful. The answer would be A.\n"
