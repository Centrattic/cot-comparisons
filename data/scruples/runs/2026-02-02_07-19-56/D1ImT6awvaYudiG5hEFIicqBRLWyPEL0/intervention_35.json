I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. The key points here are communication in a relationship and trust.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they had already discussed the topic of children and birth control early in their relationship. The GF is on the fence about children, which the author doesn't want, so he's relying on her birth control. He asks to see her pill pack during their first time sleeping together, which made her upset and led to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, from a relationship advice perspective, trust is crucial. If they've already had the conversation about birth control and the author trusts her, then asking for proof might be seen as distrustful. However, the author's concern is about ensuring they're on the same page and preventing pregnancy. The GF might feel that the request is intrusive or a violation of privacy, especially during a vulnerable moment when the mood was set for intimacy.\n\nIn many relationships, it's important to have open and honest communication. The author might have intended to confirm her honesty, but the method of doing so during an intimate moment could be seen as inappropriate. It's possible that there's a misunderstanding here. The author should have perhaps discussed this more calmly during a non-intimate time, rather than making a request that could feel like a test or a challenge to her trustworthiness.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern isn't unfounded. If he's not open to children and wants to ensure that she's taking her birth control, it's a valid concern. However, the way he approached it might have been too abrupt. It's possible that the GF felt her privacy was invaded, leading to her emotional response.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's intention might be to protect both of them from unintended pregnancy, which is a legitimate concern. However, the action of asking for visual proof during their first time together could come across as distrustful. Healthy relationships require trust, and such a request might undermine that trust, especially if it was unexpected or not discussed beforehand.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't approach the situation with enough consideration for his GF's feelings and the context of their relationship. The request was made at an inopportune time and could be perceived as a lack of trust, even if the intention was to prevent pregnancy. The GF's reaction indicates that the request was hurtful, which suggests that the author should have handled the situation more sensitively.\n"
