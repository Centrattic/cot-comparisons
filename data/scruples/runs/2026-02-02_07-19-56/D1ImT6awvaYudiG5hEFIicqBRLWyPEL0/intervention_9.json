I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 23-year-old male, who is in an 11-month relationship with his girlfriend, a 21-year-old female. They were about to have sex, and he asked her to show him her birth control. Now they're not talking because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the author's request to see her birth control. He mentions that they had discussed his stance on not wanting children in the future and her being on the fence. The discussion happened early in their relationship, so he should already be aware of her position. Now, he's asking for visual evidence, which might be seen as distrustful.\n\nTrust is a big part of any relationship. If he's already told her he doesn't want kids and she's on the fence, he should trust that she's being honest. By asking to see the actual birth control, he's not just questioning her, but implying that he doesn't believe her. That could be hurtful. She might feel like he's accusing her of lying or not being responsible. Even if he's paranoid, his actions could come off as disrespectful or dismissive of her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is communication. They had a conversation about this early on. If there were any doubts, maybe he should have addressed them then. Now, during a vulnerable moment (getting intimate), bringing up the topic again by asking to see the pills adds pressure. It's possible he should have trusted her as he said they already discussed it. The fact that it killed the mood and caused a rift suggests that his approach was problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's just being cautious. He doesn't want kids, and if he's not on birth control, he's taking a risk. But the way he went about it was intrusive. There might be better ways to ensure both parties are on the same page without making her feel disrespected. For example, discussing the effectiveness of her method or maybe suggesting another form of contraception they both agree on.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action of asking to see her birth control is likely seen as a breach of trust and an invasion of privacy. He should have trusted her word if they had already had the conversation. His approach might have been too direct and lacked sensitivity. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
