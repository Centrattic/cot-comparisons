I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to show him her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, he asked if she was on birth control, she mentioned being on the fence about having kids, and he wanted to see proof. Then she got upset, mood killed, and they didn't talk after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions they had discussed this early on in the relationship, so maybe there was some prior conversation about birth control. The key point here is the request to see the actual birth control. While it's understandable that he wants to ensure they're on the same page regarding avoiding pregnancy, demanding visual proof can come off as distrustful or controlling. Trust is a big factor in relationships. Even if he's concerned, asking to see it might be overstepping. It's one thing to discuss and agree on birth control methods, but another to require proof. That could make her feel like he doesn't trust her honesty, which can be a big turn-off and damage trust. \n\nAlso, the context is that they were in the middle of a romantic moment, and bringing up such a request right then might be inconsiderate. It's possible that the timing and the way he asked contributed to her negative reaction. She might feel that his focus was more on verifying rather than being present in the moment. Even if his intentions are good, the method of asking could be the issue.\n\nAnother angle is that she's on the fence about having kids, so maybe there's some underlying tension or uncertainty. His request might have triggered her anxiety or made her feel pressured. Respecting her autonomy and ongoing decision-making process is important. Instead of demanding proof, a more supportive conversation about their mutual goals might have been better. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have a valid concern about not wanting kids and wanting to ensure they're aligned. However, trust and communication are key. If they had already discussed it, maybe he should have trusted her word unless there was a specific reason to doubt her. \n\nPutting it all together, the author's action of asking to see the birth control directly could be seen as a breach of trust and a lack of respect for her autonomy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
