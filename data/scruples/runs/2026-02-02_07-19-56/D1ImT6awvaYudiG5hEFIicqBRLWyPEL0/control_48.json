I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

So the situation is that he asked his girlfriend to show him her birth control for the first time they were going to have sex. He doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. They had talked about this before, but he wanted visual confirmation. She got upset, the mood was ruined, and they didn't talk the next day.\n\nHmm. First, trust is a big part of relationships. He's expressing concern about not wanting children, which they had discussed early on. But then he asks to see her birth control, which might be seen as a breach of trust. Even if he's paranoid, asking to see it could come off as distrustful. Birth control is a personal and private matter. Maybe he should have trusted her word, especially since they had already had that conversation before. Also, the timing was during a romantic moment, which might have made her feel pressured or accused. Instead of building trust, his action might have undermined it. So, even if his intentions were to avoid pregnancy, the way he approached it might be the problem. The answer might be that he's in the wrong because he didn't trust her after their prior discussion, leading to conflict.\n"
