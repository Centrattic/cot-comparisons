I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault (AITA). The situation is that a 23-year-old male in a 11-month relationship with a 21-year-old female asked to see her birth control for the first time they were going to have sex. The key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the man mentions they had already discussed the topic earlier in the relationship. He states he doesn't want children, and she's on the fence. So there's already some alignment there. However, when he asks to see the birth control, it ruins the mood and they don't communicate the next day. \n\nNow, the crux here is whether asking to see the birth control is an overstep. Trust is a big part of relationships. If they've already had the conversation about her using birth control, maybe he should trust her word without needing visual proof. On the other hand, his concern is about not wanting children, so maybe his paranoia is understandable. But is demanding to see the physical item a breach of trust?\n\nI think the issue is about how he approached it. Instead of trusting her after the initial discussion, he wanted to verify visually. That can come across as distrustful. Even if he's being cautious, asking to see the birth control might make her feel like he doesn't believe her or is invading her privacy. The fact that it killed the mood and led to a breakdown in communication suggests that his request was a problem.\n\nAlso, considering they're both young and the relationship is 11 months in, maturity in handling such situations is important. The woman might feel that his request was unnecessary and could hurt her feelings. Healthy relationships require trust and open communication. Instead of demanding proof, maybe he should have discussed his concerns again or made sure they had a mutual understanding without needing to see the pills.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's request might be seen as a breach of trust and a lack of respect for her privacy. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
