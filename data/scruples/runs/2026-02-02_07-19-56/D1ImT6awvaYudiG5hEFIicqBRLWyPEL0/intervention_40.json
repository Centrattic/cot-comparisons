I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see his girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, and the guy asked to see her birth control pills as a way to confirm she's on them. They had discussed this before, but he wanted visual proof because he's worried about unwanted pregnancy. The girlfriend was upset, and they didn't talk after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy doesn't want children, and the girl is on the fence. They had an initial discussion about this. Maybe he's just being cautious. But asking to see her birth control could be seen as distrustful. Trust is important in a relationship. Even if he's paranoid, asking for proof might come off as not trusting her honesty, which can be a big issue.\n\nAlso, the way he approached it might have been a mood killer. Instead of just trusting her word, he wanted to see it, which could make her feel like he's accusing her of lying. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like discussing it more openly or using additional protection like a condom, which they were already using. But he was already using a condom, so maybe he was just trying to double-check. Still, the method of asking to see the pills might be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might have been honest, and his request could be seen as unnecessary and invasive. It's possible that she felt disrespected or not trusted. In relationships, things like this can lead to conflicts. The author's intention was to ensure honesty, but the action might have been too direct and lacking in consideration for her feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't trust her enough, even after they had a prior discussion. It's important to respect each other's boundaries and established trust. Asking for visual proof in the moment during a potentially intimate situation could be seen as a breach of trust.\n"
