I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 23-year-old male, asked his 21-year-old girlfriend of 11 months to show him her birth control. They were about to have sex, and he wanted to confirm she was using it because he doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. He mentioned they had discussed this before. Now, after he asked to see it, the mood was ruined, they didn't talk that night, and she hasn't talked to him the next day. The question is if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had discussed the topic before, so maybe he's trying to ensure honesty. But asking to see the actual birth control could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if he's concerned about not wanting children, demanding proof might be too much. Trust is a big part of relationships. If they already had the conversation, maybe he should trust her word instead of requiring visual evidence. That could come off as distrustful or controlling. On the other hand, if she's on the fence about having kids, maybe he's just trying to protect his own future. But how he approached it might be the issue. Instead of asking to see it, maybe he could have discussed more about her stance or suggested alternative methods. \n\nAlso, cultural norms might play a role here. In some views, partners sharing such information is normal, but actually seeing the pills might be too much. It's possible he overstepped by asking for proof rather than relying on her honesty. The fact that it killed the mood and caused a cold shoulder suggests that she felt disrespected. So even if his intentions were to prevent pregnancy, the method he used might be the problem. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong because he didn't trust her and acted in a way that could be seen as intrusive.\n"
