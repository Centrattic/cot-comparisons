I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see his girlfriend's birth control. The author is a 23-year-old man in an 11-month relationship with a 21-year-old woman. They were getting intimate, and he asked to see her birth control. The key points here are trust, communication, and the impact of his actions.\n\nFirst, they had already discussed his stance on not wanting children and her being on the fence. That suggests they had some level of open communication. However, when it comes to actually seeing the birth control, that's where things went south. The author might be feeling insecure or wanting to verify her honesty, which is understandable for some people. But trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and asking to see the pills could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was negative; the mood was killed, and they stopped talking. She didn't respond the next day, which might indicate she felt hurt or disrespected. The question is whether the author's action was a reasonable request or if it overstepped. \n\nIn relationships, both partners have the right to express their boundaries and needs. However, demanding proof can be seen as controlling or not trusting the other person. The author might have been trying to ensure safety, but the way he approached it could have been hurtful. It's possible that instead of asking to see the pills, he could have discussed his concerns about pregnancy and explored other methods of contraception together, like using condoms consistently and correctly. \n\nAnother angle is that the author already used a condom, which is a reliable method of preventing pregnancy. His request to see the birth control might have been redundant and could have stemmed from anxiety rather than necessity. The girlfriend's right to privacy and autonomy is also a factor here. She might feel that her personal health decisions are being questioned, which can be a sensitive topic.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action might have been a misstep. Trust and communication are crucial, and his request might have undermined the trust she was extending to him. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not respecting her privacy and for not finding a more collaborative solution.\n"
