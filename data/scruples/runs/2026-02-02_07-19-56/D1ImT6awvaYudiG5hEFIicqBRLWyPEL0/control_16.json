I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to see her birth control. The scenario is that they were about to have sex, the guy used a condom, but also wanted to check her birth control. They mentioned they've discussed kids before, and he's hesitant about children, while she's on the fence. He feels paranoid but wanted visual proof of her honesty. The result was that it ruined the mood, they didn't talk after, and now she's not responding the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The guy's main concern is about not wanting children, and he's tried to make sure with both a condom and checking her birth control. He's been open about his stance earlier in the relationship. His request for visual proof might come from a place of wanting to be certain, especially if trust is an issue. However, asking to see her birth control could be seen as invasive or not trusting her, which might hurt her feelings or make her feel disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction was that the mood was killed, and she didn't talk to him. Maybe she felt that his request was an overstep, questioning her honesty even though they had discussed it before. Trust is important in relationships, and if he's not trusting her after they've had the conversation, that could be a problem. Also, asking to see her medication or medical records might be a privacy issue.\n\nBut then again, he's using a condom as a backup, so maybe his request is just to have another layer of assurance. However, the way he approached it might have been the issue. Instead of directly asking to see it, maybe discussing the trust aspect or confirming their agreement would have been better. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He has valid concerns about not wanting children, but the method he used to address it might have been inappropriate. The key factors are communication and mutual respect. If they had discussed this earlier and she agreed to use birth control, his request could be seen as not fully trusting her, which is a breach of trust. Alternatively, if he felt the need for absolute certainty, maybe there's some insecurity or past experiences that led to this, but it's still about how he handled it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't trust her after the initial discussion, leading to a breach of trust and invading her privacy. But it's not entirely clear, and both sides have points. However, in relationship advice terms, trust is crucial, and his action might have undermined that.\n"
