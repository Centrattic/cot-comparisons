I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (23M) asked his girlfriend (21F) to show him her birth control before having sex for the first time. He doesn't want kids but she's on the fence. He wanted visual proof of her honesty.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The couple had discussed this issue early on, so maybe the author felt the need to confirm because of past experiences or just being cautious. But asking to see the actual birth control right before intimacy might be seen as distrustful. Even if they had talked about it before, the way he approached it could be problematic. \n\nBirth control is a personal matter, and while it's important to be honest, demanding to see it during a moment when they were about to have sex could be very off-putting. It might come off as a lack of trust, which can be hurtful. The girl might feel that he's not respecting her privacy or the previous conversation where she expressed her views. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they had the discussion early on, but maybe he should have trusted her based on that. If she had been dishonest before, maybe there was a reason to be cautious, but this is the first time. The fact that it \"killed the mood\" suggests she felt pressured or maybe embarrassed. \n\nIn relationships, trust is key. If the author is being paranoid, as he mentioned, that could indicate an underlying issue of not trusting her. Even if his intentions were good, the method was poor. It's important to communicate without making the other person feel like they're being interrogated, especially in intimate moments. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might have overstepped by asking for physical proof instead of relying on their prior conversation. The answer is likely that he is in the wrong (A) for not trusting her and for making the request in that context. The alternative is B, but I think the key here is the breach of trust and the inappropriate timing of the request.\n"
