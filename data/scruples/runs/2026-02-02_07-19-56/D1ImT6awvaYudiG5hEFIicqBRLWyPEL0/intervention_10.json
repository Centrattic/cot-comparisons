I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy (23M) asked his girlfriend (21F) to show him her birth control because he didn't want kids and wanted visual proof she was using it. They were about to have sex for the first time, and when he asked, it ruined the mood and they didn't talk the next day.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the context. The couple had discussed this issue before, so he shouldn't be surprised she's on the fence. But he wants to make sure she's using birth control. However, asking to see it might be seen as controlling or not trusting her. Even though his intention is to avoid pregnancy, demanding proof could come off as invasive. Birth control is a personal medical choice, and while he has a right to know if she's using it, asking for visual evidence might be crossing a boundary. It's possible he should have trusted her word instead of making her show it. But maybe he's just being cautious. But in relationships, trust is important. If she said she's on birth control, maybe he should trust her without needing to see it. Unless she's been dishonest before, but the story says they had the conversation early on. So maybe he overstepped by asking to see the actual pills. That could make him at fault. But some people might understand his need for certainty. However, the way he did it might have been too direct and made her uncomfortable, hence the mood being ruined. So the answer could be A, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The key points are about trust and communication. If he trusted her, he might not need to see it. But if he's genuinely concerned about not wanting kids and she's on the fence, maybe he's trying to protect himself. However, the method of asking for visual proof could be problematic. So I think the author is in the wrong because it's about respecting her privacy and trust. So answer A.\n"
