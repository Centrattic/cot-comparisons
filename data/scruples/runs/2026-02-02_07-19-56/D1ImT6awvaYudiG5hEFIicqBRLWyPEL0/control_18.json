I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy (23M) asked his girlfriend (21F, 11 months together) to show him her birth control before their first time having sex. He mentions they had discussed his not wanting children and her being on the fence before. When he asked to see it, it ruined the mood, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective: he wants to make sure she's honest about using birth control because he doesn't want kids. Maybe he's concerned about her actually being on birth control or just wants to confirm her commitment. But does that justify asking to see it? There might be trust issues here.\n\nOn the girl's side, she might feel that the request is intrusive or accusatory. Even if they had discussed it before, seeing physical proof could make her feel like he doesn't trust her. Birth control is a private medical matter, and asking to see the actual pills or prescriptions might cross a boundary. It could make her question his intentions or feel pressured.\n\nI should also think about relationship norms. Communication is key. If he was worried about honesty, maybe he should have discussed it more before jumping to seeing the physical evidence. Trust in a relationship is important. If he can't trust her without seeing proof, that might indicate deeper issues. Alternatively, if she was being dishonest, maybe there's a problem there too, but the way he approached it might have been the issue.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes people use birth control for reasons other than pregnancy prevention, like managing health issues. So asking to see it could be a privacy invasion. The fact that it killed the mood suggests it was a sensitive topic for her. Maybe she didn't expect the request and felt uncomfortable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the guy had the right to express his concerns, but the method might have been inappropriate. He could have approached it differently, like discussing again the importance of birth control to him and ensuring mutual understanding without demanding a visual check. The act of asking to see it might be overstepping, leading to the rift between them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards AITA being on the guy for not respecting her privacy and potentially breaking trust by making the request in that context. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a balance of both not wanting to have kids and verifying, but the way he did it was wrong.\n"
