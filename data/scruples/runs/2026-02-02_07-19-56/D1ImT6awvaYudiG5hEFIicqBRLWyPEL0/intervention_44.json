I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to show her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, the author asked to see the birth control, which made the GF uncomfortable and they didn't talk for the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is in a relationship that's been going for 11 months. They've already discussed the topic of children before. The author doesn't want kids, the GF is on the fence. So, the author is concerned about pregnancy and wants to be sure she's on birth control. But instead of trusting her word, he asks to see the actual medication. \n\nNow, is that reasonable? Well, trust is a big part of relationships. If they've already had the conversation and she said she's on birth control, he's asking for proof. Some people might see that as overstepping, as it's a privacy issue. Even if he's trying to be safe, demanding to see the pill might come off as distrustful. It could be seen as not respecting her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being cautious. Maybe he's been in situations before where people lied about birth control, so he wants to be sure. However, the way he approached it\u2014during a moment when they're about to be intimate\u2014might be too direct and could be perceived as aggressive or disrespectful. The fact that it killed the mood and led to a breakdown in communication suggests that his approach might not have been the best.\n\nAlso, there are other ways to ensure protection. Using a condom, as he did, provides a backup method. If he's truly worried about her honesty, maybe that's a sign of underlying trust issues, which could be a bigger problem in the relationship. Instead of asking for proof in that moment, maybe a more open conversation about his fears and finding a mutually agreeable solution would have been better.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action might be seen as a breach of trust and privacy. Even if his intentions were to avoid an unwanted pregnancy, the method he chose could be considered disrespectful. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
