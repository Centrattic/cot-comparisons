I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking to see his girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, and the guy wanted to confirm she was on birth control because he doesn't want kids. He already had a discussion with her about it, but he wanted visual proof. Now, she's upset and they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been in a relationship for 11 months. The guy mentioned they discussed this early on, so he might feel they already had the conversation. However, asking for visual evidence could come off as distrustful or controlling. Trust is a big part of relationships. Even if he's \"paranoid,\" demanding to see her medication might not be the best approach. \n\nThe girl might feel that her privacy is being invaded. Birth control is a personal medical matter. While it's important to be honest about birth control methods, asking her to show it could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. Maybe a better approach would be to have an open conversation about the discussion they already had and express his concerns without demanding to see it. \n\nAlso, the fact that this killed the mood and led to them not talking suggests that the request was a big deal for her. It's possible she felt disrespected or that he wasn't trusting her. Even if their initial discussions were okay, the act of asking for proof could have undermined that trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's intention might be to ensure they're both on the same page about not having kids. But there might be other ways to approach that without asking for physical proof. Maybe suggesting using dual protection (condom and her birth control) would have been a safer way to address his concerns without making her feel like he doesn't trust her word. \n\nSo overall, while his intention might be to avoid parenthood, the method he used might have been inappropriate. The answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't respect her privacy and trust, even if his concern was valid.\n"
