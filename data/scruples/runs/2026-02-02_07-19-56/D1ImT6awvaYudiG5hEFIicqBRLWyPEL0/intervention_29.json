I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that a guy, 23, is in an 11-month relationship with his girlfriend, who's 21. They were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control. She didn't want to, and now she's upset and they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had already discussed their stance on children. The author doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. They had this conversation early on, so maybe he's trying to ensure her honesty. But asking to see the actual birth control might be an overstep. \n\nBirth control is a personal health matter. People might not feel comfortable sharing that information, even with a partner. Even if they discussed it before, the act of showing physical proof could feel intrusive. Trust is a big part of relationships. If he's questioning her honesty so directly, maybe the trust isn't there. \n\nAlso, the way he approached it\u2014during a moment of intimacy\u2014might have been stressful for her. Instead of a calm discussion, he waited until they were about to have sex. That could be seen as pressuring or not respecting her privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, his concern is understandable. He doesn't want children and wants to make sure there's no risk. But the method he used might be problematic. The right approach might have been to discuss it openly, maybe suggest she use an additional method like condoms, or talk about other precautions instead of demanding to see her medication. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was probably the wrong way to handle it. Asking to see the birth control is an invasion of privacy. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
