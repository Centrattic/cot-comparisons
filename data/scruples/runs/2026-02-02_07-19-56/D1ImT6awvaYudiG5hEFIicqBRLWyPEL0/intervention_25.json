I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about whether the author (23M) is in the wrong for asking his GF (21F) to show him her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and he wanted to see proof she's on birth control because he doesn't want kids and she's uncertain. He asked to see it, which ruined the mood, and they didn't talk after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his GF have discussed this before. He's clear about not wanting kids, she's on the fence. He's not just being paranoid; he's been upfront with her about his stance. But when it comes time to actually have sex, he wants verification. \n\nNow, in relationships, trust is key. Even if there's a discussion early on, does that mean he's justified in asking for visual evidence? Maybe he's trying to avoid pregnancy, which is understandable. But asking to see the birth control might come across as distrustful. Even though they had the conversation, he's now asking for proof, which could feel like he's not trusting her. Especially since she's already told him she's on birth control, but he's not satisfied with her word.\n\nAlso, the fact that it killed the mood and caused a rift. It's possible she felt disrespected or that he wasn't respecting her autonomy. Birth control is a personal choice, and showing it might be something she's not comfortable with. Maybe she expected that if she said she was on birth control, that was enough. Now, he's questioning her honesty, which might make her feel like he doesn't trust her.\n\nBut on the other hand, he's taking precautions. If he doesn't want kids, and she's uncertain, maybe he's trying to be extra careful. However, the way he approached it might have been the problem. Maybe a better approach would have been to use a condom as an additional measure instead of demanding to see her birth control. That would show trust in her word while still protecting himself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's request might be seen as overstepping. He's asking for something that could be a privacy issue and might not be something she's willing to share. Trust is important, and even if he's being cautious, his method of ensuring it isn't the best. The answer is likely AITA because the author's actions could be seen as undermining trust and respecting her boundaries.\n"
