I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. The situation is that they had a discussion early on about not wanting children, and the author wanted to see proof during their first time sleeping together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Trust is a big part of relationships. The author mentions not wanting children and that the girlfriend is on the fence. He asked for visual evidence, which might come off as distrustful. Even if he's being cautious, asking to see the birth control could be perceived as an invasion of privacy. \n\nBirth control is a personal health matter. People might feel uncomfortable showing personal items like pills or prescriptions. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014mood killed, not talking the next day\u2014suggests that the request made her feel disrespected or not trusted. \n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The author might have thought he was being responsible, but the way he approached it might have crossed a boundary. Instead of asking for proof, maybe discussing their future plans again or having a more open conversation about their comfort levels would have been better. \n\nAlso, considering their age, both are young and might still be figuring out their boundaries. The author's action could be seen as pressuring the girlfriend into proof, which isn't necessary if they had already discussed their positions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because the request could be seen as a breach of trust and privacy, even if his intentions were to avoid pregnancy.\n"
