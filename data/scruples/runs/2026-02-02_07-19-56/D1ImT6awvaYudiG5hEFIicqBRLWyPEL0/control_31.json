I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the guy, 23, is with his girlfriend of 11 months, who's 21. They were about to have sex, and he asked her to show him her birth control. He doesn't want kids, she's on the fence. He wanted visual proof that she's using birth control, which led to a conflict and they didn't talk the next day.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships. Asking to see the birth control might come off as not trusting her, even if he had good intentions. Maybe he should have discussed it more before the encounter. But he did talk to her about it early on, so he wasn't just out of the blue. However, asking to see the actual pills could be seen as invasive or a breach of privacy. Birth control is a personal matter, and while it's important for him not to have kids, demanding proof in that moment might not be the best approach. It could make her feel like he doesn't trust her honesty. Even if he's paranoid, the way he handled it might have been too direct and caused a rift. Communication is key. Maybe a better approach would be to talk about it more openly, maybe get a second method of protection, or discuss their future plans again. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's trying to ensure his boundaries are respected. On the other, the method he used could have been hurtful. I think the answer would be A, he's in the wrong because the way he asked for proof was probably not trusting and might have been disrespectful. But others might argue he's just being cautious. Hmm.\n"
