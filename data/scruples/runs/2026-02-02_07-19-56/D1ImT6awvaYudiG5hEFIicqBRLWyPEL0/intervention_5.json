      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 23-year-old man in a relationship with a 21-year-old girlfriend who's been together for 11 months. They were about to have sex for the first time, and he asked her if she was on birth control. She mentioned she's on the fence about children in the future, and he wanted to see visual proof. When he asked to see her birth control, it killed the mood, and they ended up not talking for the rest of the night. Now, she hasn't responded the next day, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had discussed this issue early in the relationship, so he knew her stance was uncertain. However, when actually about to engage in sexual activity, he wanted to verify her statement by seeing the pills. This seems like he's not trusting her, even though they had a prior conversation. Trust is a key component in relationships, especially in such personal matters. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction makes sense. If someone you're close to suddenly wants to see your medication to verify what you've already told them, it can feel like a breach of trust. Even if he's being cautious, the way he approached it might have been intrusive. Birth control is a personal medical decision, and while it's important to discuss, demanding to see the pills in the heat of the moment could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. \n\nAlso, considering their ages and the length of the relationship, it's possible that she's still figuring out her stance on future children, which is a valid and common experience. His need for visual confirmation might have come across as dismissive of her feelings or her honesty. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being responsible about not wanting children and ensuring that there's a method in place. However, there's a balance between being responsible and respecting trust. The method of verification he chose might have been inappropriate. \n\nIn many relationships, open communication is key. Instead of demanding to see the pills, he might have had an earlier conversation to clarify her plans or perhaps suggested using a condom as a dual method. By asking to see the pills at that moment, he might have made her feel uncomfortable or untrusted, leading to the breakdown in communication. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, likely overstepped in terms of trust and privacy. Therefore, the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
