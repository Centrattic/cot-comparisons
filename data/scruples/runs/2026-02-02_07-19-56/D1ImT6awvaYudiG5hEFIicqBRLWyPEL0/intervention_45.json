I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting to see their girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, and during the moment, he asked her to show him the birth control. They had discussed the topic earlier, but this request made her lose the mood, and they didn't talk for the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had already talked about birth control and future children in the early stages of their 11-month relationship. The guy doesn't want children, and she's on the fence. So, communication about this was present. But when the moment came, he wanted visual confirmation, which she wasn't comfortable with.\n\nNow, why would she be upset? Trust is a big part of relationships. If he's asking to see the birth control, maybe he's doubting her honesty. That could feel invasive or like he doesn't trust her. Even if he had good intentions, the way he approached it might have been too direct or lacking in sensitivity. It's possible that the request was perceived as a breach of privacy. Birth control is a personal matter, and asking to see it during an intimate moment could be seen as pressuring her or making her uncomfortable, especially if it's the first time they're sleeping together.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy might be trying to protect both of them, given his stance on not wanting children. But there's a difference between discussing and verifying. They had already talked about it, so maybe he should have trusted her word. If he was genuinely concerned about her honesty, maybe approaching it with a more supportive conversation rather than a demand to see the physical proof would have been better. \n\nThe outcome shows that this request ruined the mood and led to a breakdown in communication. That suggests that his action might have been too abrupt or not considerate of her feelings. So even if his intention was to be cautious, the method might have been inappropriate. \n\nIn relationships, trust is key. Asking to see her birth control could be seen as a lack of trust, which is a big issue. She might feel that he's not respecting her privacy or that he's making her prove her commitment in a stressful way. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards AITA being the author. The key points are trust, privacy, and communication. He might have overstepped by asking for visual evidence, even if the topic was discussed. The right approach would have been to trust her word and maybe revisit the conversation if there were doubts, rather than demanding proof at that moment.\n"
