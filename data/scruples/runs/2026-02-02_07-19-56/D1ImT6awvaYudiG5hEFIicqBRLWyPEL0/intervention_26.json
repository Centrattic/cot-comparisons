I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a man wanting to see his girlfriend's birth control as proof she's using it, which caused tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning: he doesn't want kids, has discussed it before, but now wants visual confirmation. He might feel insecure or trust issues here. But asking to see the actual pill could be a privacy invasion. Trust is a big part of relationships. If they've already discussed it and she said yes, maybe he should trust her word. On the flip side, maybe he's just being cautious. But the way he approached it\u2014during a intimate moment\u2014might have been the problem. It could feel like an accusation. Also, not talking for the rest of the night and no communication the next day suggests it hurt her feelings. \n\nAnother angle: birth control is a personal medical issue. People might not want to show it to a partner. It's private. Even if he's concerned, it's not his right to demand proof. Trust is supposed to be mutual. If she said she's using it, maybe he should trust that. Also, using a condom adds an extra layer of protection, so maybe he's being redundant. \n\nBut maybe his intention was to ensure safety, but the method was wrong. The key here is whether the request was reasonable. In most relationships, unless there's a history of deception, demanding proof like that could be seen as distrustful. So the author might be in the wrong for not trusting her word and for bringing it up in the heat of the moment, which could have been inappropriate timing. \n\nAlso, considering their ages, they might be young and still learning relationship dynamics. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy was disrespected. Even if his intentions were good, the action was problematic. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
