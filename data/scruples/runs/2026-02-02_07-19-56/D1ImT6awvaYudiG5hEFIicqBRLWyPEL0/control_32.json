I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that a guy, 23, in a 11-month relationship with his 21-year-old girlfriend, wanted to check if she was on birth control. They had discussed this before, but when he asked to see her birth control, it ruined the mood, and they didn't talk after. Now she's not responding the next day. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the guy's concern is understandable. They had a discussion about not wanting kids, and he's probably trying to ensure they're on the same page. But asking to see the birth control might come off as distrustful. Even though they had talked about it earlier, requesting visual proof could make her feel like he doesn't trust her, which can be hurtful. Trust is important in a relationship, and actions that undermine trust can lead to issues. Also, using a condom in addition to her birth control is a standard precaution, so maybe there was a better way to handle it without making her feel disrespected. The fact that it killed the mood and caused a rift suggests that his approach might have been too direct or invasive. So, while his intentions might be about safety, the method was possibly inappropriate. The answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't trust her and it caused conflict.\n"
