I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to see her birth control. The situation is that they're both in a 11-month relationship. The guy is 23, the girl is 21. They were about to have sex, he put a condom on, and then asked to see her birth control. He doesn't want kids, she's on the fence. He wanted visual proof of her honesty because it was their first time sleeping together. Now she's upset, the mood is killed, and they didn't talk after.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and communication in relationships. The guy already mentioned they had a discussion early on about children. So he knows her stance is on the fence, but he's clear about not wanting kids. He might be feeling uncertain about her honesty, hence asking to see the birth control. But is that crossing a line?\n\nIn terms of privacy, birth control is a personal medical matter. Even though they're in a relationship, demanding to see her pills might be seen as intrusive. Trust is a big part of relationships. If he doesn't trust her, maybe he should have addressed that earlier rather than asking for proof during an intimate moment. Also, the context is during a sexual situation, which might not be the best time to bring up such a request. It could be perceived as a power move or not respecting her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being proactive about avoiding pregnancy. But using a condom already covers that, so maybe his request is redundant and more about needing reassurance beyond her word. That could come from insecurity, which is his issue, not hers. Insisting on seeing her BC might not be necessary if they've already discussed it before. Trust is key here. If he can't trust her based on their previous conversation, that's a deeper issue in the relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that it ruined the mood and she didn't talk to him the next day suggests that his request made her uncomfortable. She might feel that he doesn't trust her, which can be hurtful. Even if his intentions were to avoid pregnancy, the method he used was inappropriate. \n\nSo considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't respect her privacy and possibly breached trust by not trusting her after their prior discussion. The answer should be A.\n"
