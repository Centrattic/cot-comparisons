I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking to see his girlfriend's birth control. The author is a 23-year-old male in a 11-month relationship with a 21-year-old female. They had a discussion early on about future children, where the author made his stance clear that he doesn't want kids, but she's on the fence. Now, during their first time sleeping together, he asked to see her birth control pills as proof of her honesty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of relationships. The author says he's \"paranoid,\" which suggests he might not fully trust her. But asking for visual evidence could come off as intrusive or not trusting her word. Even though they had discussed this before, bringing it up in the heat of the moment might have been a bad move. It's possible she felt disrespected or doubted, which could explain why the mood was ruined and she stopped talking to him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. Birth control is a mutual responsibility, and ensuring that both partners are on the same page is important. However, the method of verification here is questionable. Instead of asking to see the pills right then and there, maybe a more appropriate time would have been better. Also, if they had already discussed the issue before, maybe he should have trusted her word unless there was a specific reason to doubt her.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is using a condom as an additional precaution, which is good. But the fact that he needed to see the pills might indicate an overreaction. It's possible that the way he approached it was more about his own insecurities than a necessary check. Relationships require trust, and actions that undermine that can cause problems. So, in this case, the author's actions might have been the root of the problem.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's reasonable for him to want confirmation, especially since their future plans differ. But the method of asking in the middle of intimacy is likely not the best approach. The key here is whether the request was respectful and communicated in the right context. Since it ruined the mood and caused a breakdown in communication, it might indicate that the author's approach was flawed.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author is probably in the wrong because he didn't trust her after a prior discussion and brought it up at an inopportune time, leading to conflict. The answer would be A.\n"
