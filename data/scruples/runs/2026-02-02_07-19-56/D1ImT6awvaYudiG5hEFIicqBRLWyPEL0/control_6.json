I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy (23-year-old) in an 11-month relationship with his girlfriend (21-year-old). They were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control as proof she's using it. She was upset, and they didn't talk for the rest of the night. Now she hasn't responded the next day. The guy is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had discussed birth control before. He doesn't want children, she's on the fence. He wants to make sure she's honest. But asking to see the actual pills might be crossing a line. Trust is a big part of relationships. Even if he's concerned about his future, demanding proof could be seen as a breach of trust. She might feel he doesn't trust her judgment or privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, his concern is valid because he doesn't want children. Maybe he felt the need for reassurance. But the method he used was intrusive. Instead of checking her birth control, maybe he should have had an open conversation again or considered other methods like using condoms consistently. \n\nThe fact that she was upset and the mood was ruined suggests that his approach hurt her feelings. In healthy relationships, communication is key. If he expressed his concerns in a non-confrontational way, maybe she would have felt more comfortable discussing it. But demanding to see the pills might come across as controlling or distrustful. \n\nAlso, the response was silence from her, which could indicate she felt disrespected. Even if his intentions were to avoid pregnancy, the way he handled it was not the best. So, the answer is probably that he's in the wrong because his actions were distrustful and potentially hurtful, even if his intentions were to protect himself from an unwanted pregnancy.\n"
