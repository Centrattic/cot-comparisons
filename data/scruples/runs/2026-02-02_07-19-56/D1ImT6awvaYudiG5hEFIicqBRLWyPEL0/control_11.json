I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show her birth control. First, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for 11 months, and they're talking about their first time sleeping together. The guy wants to use a condom but is concerned because she's on the fence about having kids. He wants visual confirmation of her birth control, which upsets her and leads to a breakdown in communication.\n\nSo, the main points here are trust and communication. The guy is worried about unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, asking to see her birth control prescription might be overstepping. Trust is a key component in a relationship. If he already discussed this with her early on, maybe he should trust her word instead of demanding proof. By asking for visual evidence, he might be making her feel distrustful, which can be hurtful. Birth control requires a prescription, so she's already taking it if she's on it. Checking the actual pills might be unnecessary if they've already discussed it. The reaction of her being upset and not talking afterward suggests that his approach was too invasive. It's important to respect her boundaries and privacy. Maybe there's a better way to handle this, like open communication instead of demanding proof. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for not trusting her and overstepping.\n"
