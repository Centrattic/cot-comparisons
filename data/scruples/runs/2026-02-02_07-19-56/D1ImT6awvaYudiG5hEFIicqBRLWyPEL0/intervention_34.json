I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. The guy is 23, the girlfriend is 21, they've been together for 11 months. The context is that they were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control to confirm she's honest, which he mentions is important because he doesn't want kids and she's on the fence. They had discussed this before. He wanted visual evidence, which made her upset and led to them not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy's intention was to verify her honesty. But asking for proof of birth control use might be seen as distrustful. Even if they had discussed it before, asking for physical proof could be perceived as invasive or a breach of trust. Birth control management is a personal health matter, and expecting to see the pills or a prescription might not be a standard or respectful way to handle it. It's possible that the girlfriend felt disrespected or not trusted, leading to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy might feel justified in wanting to ensure there's no risk of pregnancy, especially since their future plans differ on having children. However, trust is a fundamental part of any relationship. Requiring proof of something that's already been discussed could be seen as undermining that trust. The appropriate approach might have been to discuss their contraception plans in detail, maybe set up a system that both are comfortable with, rather than demanding to see the pills.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might have her own reasons for not wanting to show her birth control, such as privacy, health reasons, or simply not carrying it at that moment. The act of asking for the pills could be seen as pressuring her in the moment of intimacy, which might be more about his anxiety than her actual non-compliance.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because the request was intrusive and possibly damaged trust. However, some might argue (B) that his intention was to prevent pregnancy, but the method was inappropriate. The main issue here is the approach taken rather than the concern itself.\n"
