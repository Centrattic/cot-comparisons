I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy (23M) asked his girlfriend (21F) to see her birth control pills before they had sex for the first time. He doesn't want kids, she's on the fence, and he just wanted to make sure she was honest. But it ruined the mood, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been in a relationship for 11 months, and they had discussed this issue before. The guy's reason is about not wanting kids and ensuring honesty. However, the way he approached it\u2014asking to see the actual pills\u2014might have been too direct or intrusive. \n\nBirth control is a personal health matter, and while trust is important, demanding to see physical proof could come off as distrustful or controlling. Even if he had doubts, the method of verification might not be respectful. It's possible that the girlfriend felt disrespected or that her privacy was invaded, especially since they were about to have sex and the mood was there. \n\nThe next day they aren't talking, which suggests the action caused significant hurt. The key points here are about mutual respect and communication. They had discussed the topic before, so maybe there was a better way to address his concerns without being confrontational in the moment. \n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If he trusted her but still wanted proof, that could indicate underlying issues. On the other hand, his concern about not wanting children is valid, but the approach might have been the problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The guy's intention was to ensure alignment on a serious issue, but the method he used could be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong for not respecting her privacy and possibly overstepping, even if his motives were about avoiding pregnancy.\n"
