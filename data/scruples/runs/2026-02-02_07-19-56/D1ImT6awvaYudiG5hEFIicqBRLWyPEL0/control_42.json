I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (23m) is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend (21f, 11 months into the relationship) to show him her birth control. They were about to have sex, and he wanted visual proof because he doesn't want kids but she's on the fence.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. They have discussed the topic of children before, but he's concerned about her honesty. He mentions he's \"paranoid,\" which might indicate anxiety or lack of trust. But why would he ask to see it at that moment? That could be seen as invasive or pressuring her, even if he's not using that as a threat. \n\nBirth control is a personal health matter. Asking to see her medication or prescriptions might make her feel disrespected or as if her autonomy is being questioned. Trust is a big part of relationships. If they've already talked about it, maybe she felt that he didn't trust her, leading to the mood being ruined.\n\nOn the other hand, he might be trying to be responsible, ensuring they're both on the same page. But the method of asking for visual evidence during a romantic moment could come off as confrontational. It's possible that he should have addressed this in a more private, non-sexual context instead of during intimacy. \n\nAlso, she's 21 and on the fence about children, so maybe she's not ready to commit to birth control or to have that aspect of her health shared with him yet. The fact that they didn't talk after that suggests she's hurt or upset. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about communication and respect. Even if the intention was to protect the relationship, the way he approached it might have been the issue. Asking to see her birth control could be a breach of privacy. So, AITA? Probably A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her privacy and trust, even if his concern was valid. He should have discussed it earlier without needing visual proof. But some might argue B if they think his caution is understandable. However, the main point is that demanding proof during intimacy is likely not the right approach.\n"
