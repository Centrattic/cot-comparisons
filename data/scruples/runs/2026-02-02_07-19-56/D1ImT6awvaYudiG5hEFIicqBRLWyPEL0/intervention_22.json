I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is a guy who's been in a relationship with his girlfriend for 11 months. They're both young, he's 23, she's 21. The context is that they were about to have sex, and he asked her to show him her birth control. He mentions he doesn't want kids in the future, but she's on the fence about having them. They had a prior discussion about this, so he's aware she's not against the idea. However, he wanted visual confirmation, which made her uncomfortable and killed the mood. Now they're not talking the next day.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships. The fact that he's asking to see her birth control might indicate a lack of trust in her honesty. Even if they had the conversation before, he's not satisfied with her word and wants physical proof. That could be seen as invasive or not respecting her privacy. Birth control is a personal health matter, and the fact that he's asking for proof might come off as controlling or not trusting her enough. \n\nBut then again, his concern is about not wanting children. If he's really not okay with any risk, maybe he's trying to ensure that there's no chance of pregnancy. However, using a condom while also asking for her birth control might be redundant, but maybe he's just being cautious. Still, his approach seems to have caused a rift. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel that her privacy was invaded. She might also feel that he's not respecting her autonomy in her healthcare decisions. The fact that the mood was killed and they stopped talking suggests that she felt hurt or disrespected by his request. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe he should have discussed his concerns again instead of asking to see the physical evidence. Trust issues can be damaging, and if he's not able to trust her word, that's a bigger problem than the birth control itself. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's action of asking to see the birth control was a breach of trust and privacy. Even though his intention was to ensure they're on the same page about birth control, the method he used was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
