I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show her birth control. Let me break this down. The situation is that the author, who's 23, and his 21-year-old girlfriend have been together for 11 months. They were about to have sex for the first time, and he asked if she was on birth control. He mentions he doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. He wanted visual proof, so he asked to see it, but that ruined the mood, and she didn't talk to him afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and trust in a relationship. Birth control is a personal choice, and while it's important for preventing pregnancy, the method of verification here might be an issue. He already had a discussion about this early on, so perhaps they had an agreement. But now he's asking for proof, which could be seen as a breach of trust. In a healthy relationship, trust is key. If he doesn't trust her, that's a problem. Maybe he should have discussed his concerns without demanding to see the physical evidence. It's possible he's being a bit controlling or not respecting her privacy. Also, the fact that this request killed the mood and caused a rift suggests that his approach might have been too direct or not considerate of her feelings. She might feel that her autonomy is being questioned. So, while his concern about not wanting children is valid, the way he addressed it could be problematic. The answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because he didn't trust her without proof, which can strain the relationship. However, some might argue that he had a legitimate concern. But generally, trust and communication are more important than demanding proof. So I think the answer is A.\n"
