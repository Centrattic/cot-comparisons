I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (23m) asking his girlfriend (21f) to show him her birth control. They've been dating 11 months, and he mentions not wanting kids, but she's on the fence. He wanted visual confirmation she was honest, which killed the mood and led to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and trust in a relationship. The author is asking for proof of birth control use. While his intent is to avoid pregnancy, demanding to see her birth control could be seen as invasive or distrustful. Trust is a big part of relationships, so this might come across as a breach of privacy. \n\nHe mentions they had already discussed this earlier, so maybe he should trust her word. However, he's worried about her honesty, so he wants visual evidence. But is that reasonable? Birth control is a personal health matter, and accessing it might require privacy. Forcing her to show it could be seen as pressuring her for something that's her personal choice.\n\nAlso, the situation happened during a moment when they were intimate, which might not be the best time for such a request. It could make her feel like he's not respecting her autonomy or the trust they've built. If he had concerns, maybe discussing it more openly and calmly before intimacy would have been better. \n\nOn the other hand, his motivation is to avoid pregnancy, which is a valid concern. But how he approached it might be the issue. Instead of asking to see it in the heat of the moment, maybe he should have asked for reassurance in a different way, like discussing her commitment to using it or maybe suggesting a method they both agree on. \n\nAlso, the fact that this caused a breakdown in communication suggests that his approach might have been inappropriate. It's possible she felt hurt or disrespected, which is why she became silent. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action might be seen as overstepping because he's asking for proof in an intimate moment and possibly not respecting her privacy and trust. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe in some contexts, checking birth control is acceptable, but generally, trust should be a foundation. Hence, A is likely the right choice.\n"
