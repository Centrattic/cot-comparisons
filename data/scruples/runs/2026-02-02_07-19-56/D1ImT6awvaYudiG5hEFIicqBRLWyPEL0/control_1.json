I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy, 23, has been in a relationship with his 21-year-old girlfriend for 11 months. They had a discussion early on about not wanting kids, and the guy is on the fence. When they were about to have sex for the first time, he asked to see her birth control as a way to verify she's being honest. That made her upset, and they didn't talk for the rest of the night. Now he's wondering if he's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had already discussed birth control earlier in the relationship. The guy's request to see the physical evidence might come off as distrustful. Trust is important in relationships. Even though he has a reason\u2014future child plans\u2014it's possible that his approach was too direct and made her feel like he didn't trust her words. \n\nBirth control is a personal medical decision, and while it's important to be honest, asking for visual proof could be seen as intrusive. The girlfriend might feel that her privacy was invaded or that he was being overly cautious. Communication is key here. If he had a concern, maybe discussing it more openly or expressing his anxieties without demanding proof would have been better.\n\nAlso, considering their age and relationship duration, maybe there's an expectation of mutual trust. The guy's action could have been perceived as a breach of trust, even if his intention was to ensure they were on the same page. The result was that the mood was ruined and they didn't communicate the next day, which suggests the request caused a significant strain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't trust her after they had already discussed it. However, some might argue that his intention was to protect both of them. But in terms of relationship dynamics, trust issues can be a big deal. The key is whether the method he used was appropriate. Since he asked for visual evidence instead of trusting her word, that's where he might have made a mistake.\n"
