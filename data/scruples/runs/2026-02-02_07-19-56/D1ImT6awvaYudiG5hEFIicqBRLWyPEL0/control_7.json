I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (a 23-year-old male) is at fault for asking his girlfriend (21-year-old, 11 months together) to show him her birth control. The context is that they were about to have sex, he asked about birth control because he doesn't want kids, she's on the fence, and he wanted visual proof of her honesty. The result was that the mood died and they didn't talk for the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The man is concerned about pregnancy and wants to ensure his partner is using birth control. He mentions they discussed this early on, but he still wanted \"visual evidence,\" which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Birth control is a personal medical matter, and expecting someone to show physical proof might not be standard. Typically, trust is a key component in relationships, and asking for such proof could undermine that trust. \n\nHowever, the man's intention isn't malicious; he's trying to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. The problem might be the approach. Instead of asking to see the pill pack or whatever, maybe he should have communicated his needs differently. Still, the act of demanding to see it could be perceived as controlling or distrustful. \n\nOn the other hand, she might have a right to her privacy. Birth control is a personal choice and medical information. If he's not willing to use another form of contraception like a condom, maybe the issue is his reluctance to share responsibility. If she's on the fence about children, maybe there's a deeper conversation needed about birth control methods and mutual responsibility.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. If she felt disrespected by the request, that's a valid response. The fact that they ended up not talking for the night suggests the situation is tense. The question is whether the man overstepped. In many perspectives, asking for proof of birth control can be seen as intrusive. Trust should be based on communication rather than physical proof unless there's a history of dishonesty, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the request for visual evidence crosses a privacy boundary and may not be necessary if there's no prior reason to distrust her. The approach was possibly disrespectful and could have been handled through open dialogue instead of a demand for proof.\n"
