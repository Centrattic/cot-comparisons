I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (23M) asking his girlfriend (21F) who's been on birth control for 11 months to show him her birth control. The context is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and he wanted to confirm she's using birth control because he doesn't want kids, even though she said she's on the fence. The question is if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The couple had discussed the topic early on, so maybe the author felt the need to double-check. But asking to see the physical proof might be overstepping. Trust is important in relationships. If they had already talked about it, maybe he didn't need to see it. It could be seen as not trusting her, which might hurt her feelings. The fact that she didn't talk to him after shows she was upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid since they haven't had kids, and he's clear about not wanting them. But the method he used\u2014asking to see the pill\u2014could be intrusive. It's possible that she respects his boundaries but felt disrespected by the request. Maybe there's a better way to handle this, like using condoms as a backup or discussing trust issues.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (at fault) because he didn't trust her after discussing it, and the request might have been too direct. However, some might argue he's justified in wanting to avoid pregnancy. But in relationships, trust is key, and the approach here might have been wrong. Hence, A is the answer.\n"
