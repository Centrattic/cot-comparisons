I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and he wanted to confirm she was on birth control because he doesn't want kids, even though she's on the fence. He asked to see it, which ruined the mood, and now she's not talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The couple has been together for 11 months. The user had discussed not wanting kids early on, and the GF said she's on the fence. He wants to ensure she's honest about using BC. He's asking for visual evidence, which the GF didn't like. Now they're not communicating.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, trust is a big part of relationships. If he already discussed this early on and she said she's on BC, maybe he should trust her. Asking to see it could come off as distrustful. Even if he's paranoid, it's not his right to demand proof. It might be a breach of her privacy. However, his concern is valid regarding future kids. But the way he approached it might have been disrespectful. So, AITA? Probably A, since he didn't trust her and it caused conflict. Alternatively, B if he's justified in wanting confirmation. But usually, in these situations, asking for proof can be seen as crossing a line. So I think the answer is A.\n"
