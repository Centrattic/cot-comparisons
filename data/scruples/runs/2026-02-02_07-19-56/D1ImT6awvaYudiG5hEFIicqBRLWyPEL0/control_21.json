I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy is 23, GF is 21, 11 months together. They were about to have sex for the first time, and he asked to see her birth control. He mentions he doesn't want kids, she's on the fence. He wanted visual evidence to be sure she's honest. The result was that she got upset, mood killed, no talking the next day.\n\nNow, considering consent and trust. In a relationship, trust is key. Asking to see her birth control might come off as distrustful. Even if he has concerns about her honesty, he should have approached it differently. Maybe discussed it more openly instead of demanding to see physical proof. It's her body and her choice, so respecting her privacy is important. Also, she might feel it's an invasion of her personal space. He used a condom as well, so maybe he should rely on that method instead of pressuring her for proof. The fact that she's on the fence about children might mean she's not ready to commit to birth control, so his request could be pressuring her. Overall, his actions might have breached the trust and made her feel uncomfortable. So, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
