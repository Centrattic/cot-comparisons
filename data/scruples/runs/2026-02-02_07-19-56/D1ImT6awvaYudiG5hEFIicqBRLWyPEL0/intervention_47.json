I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who asked his girlfriend to show him her birth control before their first time. The guy is 23, the girlfriend is 21, in an 11-month relationship. They had discussed the topic before, but when he actually asked to see the pills, it killed the mood and led to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had already talked about birth control and his stance on not wanting children. The guy probably wanted reassurance because he's not okay with pregnancy. But why did he ask to see the physical pills? Maybe he was checking for honesty. But is that reasonable?\n\nTrust is a big part of relationships. If they've already discussed it and she said she's on the pill, him asking to see it might come off as distrustful. Even if he's paranoid, it could make her feel like he doesn't trust her. That could hurt feelings, especially since it was their first time, which can be an emotional moment. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's being cautious. But usually, people trust each other's word unless there's a history of dishonesty. Asking for proof might be seen as overstepping. The girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. The mood was ruined, and she didn't talk to him afterward. That suggests he might have crossed a line.\n\nBut maybe the guy's intention was protective. He doesn't want kids, so he wants to be sure. However, that doesn't excuse not trusting her. Communication is key. If he had concerns, maybe he could have expressed them differently, like reinforcing the importance of protection without demanding proof.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It seems like AITA. He might have acted out of fear or paranoia, but it's about trust. If he can't trust her word, that's a deeper issue. The answer would likely be A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong because he didn't trust her and it ruined the moment.\n"
