I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show her birth control. So, the situation is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and he wanted to confirm she's on birth control because he doesn't want kids. They'd discussed this before, but he wanted visual proof.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective is that he's being responsible, making sure there's no risk of pregnancy. He's not the one who wants kids, so he's trying to protect both of them. But asking for proof might be seen as distrustful. Trust is a big part of relationships. If he already had a discussion where she said she was on birth control, why does he need to see it? Maybe he's nervous or anxious, but demanding proof can come off as controlling or not trusting her.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might feel that her privacy was invaded. Birth control is a personal medical decision, and showing proof might be something she's not comfortable with. Even if they discussed it before, asking to see the pills or a prescription could be a breach of trust. She might feel he's not respecting her autonomy or that he's being overly cautious without cause.\n\nAlso, the fact that it killed the mood and they ended up not talking after shows that this request caused tension. The guy might have overstepped. In a healthy relationship, trust is key. If they've already had the conversation and he still needs proof, maybe he's not trusting her enough. It's possible he should have just relied on her word, especially if they had discussed it earlier. Using a condom as a backup is another option instead of demanding proof.\n\nBut then again, he did use a condom, which shows he's taking precautions. Maybe his intention was good, but the method was poor. The way he approached it might have been too direct or not considerate of her feelings. It's important to communicate needs without making the other person feel like they have to prove themselves.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in most cases, demanding proof of something discussed previously can be seen as a lack of trust, which can be hurtful. So, the author might be in the wrong for not trusting her after they had the conversation. The answer would likely be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
