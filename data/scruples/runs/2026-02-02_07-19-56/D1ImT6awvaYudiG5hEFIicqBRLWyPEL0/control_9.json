  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking my (23m) GF (21f) of 11 months to see her birthcontrol?\nSo, the title pretty much says it all.\n\nWe were getting in the mood to wrestle naked and while putting the condom on I asked if she was using birth control. I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking to see their girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and the guy wanted to confirm she was using birth control because he doesn't want kids. He mentions they'd discussed it before, but he wanted visual proof. Now the girl is upset and hasn't talked to him since.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships. If the couple had already talked about it, maybe he should have trusted her word. But he felt the need to see it, which might come off as not trusting her. Even if his intentions are about avoiding pregnancy, demanding to see the pills could be intrusive and disrespectful. It's possible she felt disrespected or that he didn't trust her honesty. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being cautious, which is understandable. But the way he approached it might have been a mistake. Instead of asking to see it, maybe he could have discussed their birth control plans more openly, ensuring both are on the same page without making her feel he doesn't believe her. \n\nSo, the key points are about trust, communication, and respecting boundaries. If they had a prior discussion, maybe the issue was his need for visual proof, which might have been unnecessary. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't trust her enough after the initial conversation, leading to her feeling disrespected.\n"
