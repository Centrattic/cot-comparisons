I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control for the first time they're sleeping together. The key points here are trust, communication, and consent.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions they had already discussed the topic of children early in their relationship. The girlfriend says she's on the fence, which might mean she's not entirely decided. The guy doesn't want children, so he wants to ensure she's using birth control. However, asking to see the actual birth control pill pack could be seen as a violation of trust. Even if he's concerned, demanding visual proof can come across as distrustful and controlling. \n\nIn healthy relationships, trust is fundamental. If they've already discussed it and she's using birth control, he might need to trust her word. Requesting to see the pill pack could imply he doesn't believe her, which can hurt her feelings and damage trust. The girlfriend being upset and not talking to him afterward makes sense in that context. \n\nAdditionally, the timing of the request\u2014right before intimacy\u2014might have been awkward and stressful for her. It's possible she felt pressured or uncomfortable. Even if his intentions were about avoiding pregnancy, the method he used was problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have been trying to be cautious, especially since it was their first time. But there are other ways to approach this, like discussing it more openly beforehand or using dual protection methods (condom plus her birth control) to cover bases without making her feel like he's doubting her. \n\nSo, considering the dynamics of trust and communication, the guy's action of asking to see the birth control might be seen as crossing a line, even if his intentions were about safety. That makes the answer likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
