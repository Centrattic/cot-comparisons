I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show her birth control. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, their relationship has been going for 11 months. The author is 23, and his GF is 21. They had a discussion early on about not wanting children in the future, but she's on the fence. Now, during their first time sleeping together, he asks to see the birth control. The GF got upset, mood killed, and they didn't talk after that.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are trust, communication, and boundaries. They already had a conversation about this topic early on. The author didn't trust her word and wanted visual proof. That could be seen as a breach of trust. Trust is essential in relationships, and if he doesn't trust her after they've discussed things, that's a problem. \n\nBut why did he ask for visual evidence? Maybe he's trying to protect himself, given that she's on the fence about kids. But is it reasonable to demand proof? Maybe not. Once they've established communication and she says she's using birth control, he should trust her unless there's a reason to doubt her. Requiring to see the physical pill might come off as controlling or not respecting her privacy. \n\nAlso, their first time together is a sensitive moment. Asking for that proof then could be awkward and stressful, especially if she's not expecting it. Timing might have been an issue. It's possible he made her feel uncomfortable or questioned her honesty in a vulnerable situation. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not wrong for wanting to ensure they're on the same page. But the method of checking might not be the right approach. Instead of demanding to see it, a better way would be to have an open conversation about their plans and find a mutual method they both agree on. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author's request could be seen as an overstep. Trust is a two-way street, and if he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt after already having the conversation, that's a problem. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her privacy and trust.\n"
