I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 23-year-old male, asked his 21-year-old girlfriend of 11 months to show him her birth control. They were about to have sex, and he wanted visual confirmation that she was on birth control because he doesn't want kids and she's unsure. He says he brought up the topic early on, but now he's asking to see proof, which made her upset and led to her not talking to him.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether he's at fault. The user thinks he is, but wants another opinion. Let me break this down. Trust is a big part of relationships. He's asking for proof, which could be seen as distrustful. Even if he has a reason (not wanting kids), demanding to see her birth control might come off as controlling or not trusting her word. Communication is key here. They had discussed it before, so maybe she felt that was sufficient. By asking to see it, he might have crossed a line. On the other hand, his intention is to prevent pregnancy, which is valid. But the method of asking for visual evidence might not be respectful. It's possible she felt humiliated or that he wasn't respecting her privacy. \n\nAlso, the context matters. They were in a sexual situation, so bringing up such a request might have been awkward or taken the moment away. She might have felt pressured or that he wasn't considering her feelings. The fact that it killed the mood and she didn't talk to him the next day suggests she was hurt. So, even if his intentions were to prevent pregnancy, the way he approached it could be problematic. So, I think the answer is A, he's in the wrong because he didn't trust her and handled it in a way that might have been disrespectful.\n"
