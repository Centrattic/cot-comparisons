I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking to see his girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they're both in a 11-month relationship, the guy is 23, the girl is 21. They were about to have sex, he asked if she was on birth control because he doesn't want kids and they'd discussed it before. He wanted to see proof, which made her uncomfortable and they didn't talk for the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of relationships. The guy says he's being \"paranoid,\" but asking to see birth control might come off as distrustful. Even if they had discussed it before, the act of demanding visual evidence could be seen as disrespectful. It's important to consider consent and autonomy in healthcare decisions. Birth control is a personal medical choice, and she might not feel comfortable sharing that information, especially in a moment of intimacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's concern isn't unreasonable. He doesn't want kids and wants to ensure they're both on the same page. But his approach might have been too abrupt. Instead of asking to see it, maybe he could have had a more open conversation about how to ensure both parties feel safe. The fact that it killed the mood and led to a breakdown in communication suggests that his method wasn't effective. \n\nAlso, considering the age difference, the girl is 21 and might be more sensitive to being questioned about her personal health. There's a power dynamic where the guy is taking the lead, but she might feel her autonomy is being questioned. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If they had discussed this earlier, maybe the guy could have expressed his concerns in a way that respects her privacy. The key here is whether the request for proof was necessary or if there was a trust issue. If they trusted each other, maybe he could have relied on her word. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy's action was probably a breach of trust and respect for her privacy. Even if his intentions were good, the way he approached it was problematic. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong).\n"
