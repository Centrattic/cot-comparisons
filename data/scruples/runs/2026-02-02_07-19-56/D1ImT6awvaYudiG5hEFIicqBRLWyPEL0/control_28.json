I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The guy is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting to see his girlfriend's birth control. They've been together 11 months, and she's 21, he's 23. He doesn't want kids, she's on the fence. They had talked about it early on. The first night they were going to sleep together, he asked her to see the birth control, which made her upset and they didn't talk.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are consent, trust, and communication. He mentioned they had discussed this before, so maybe he felt the need for visual confirmation. But asking to see the actual pill pack might have crossed a line. Even if his intention was to ensure honesty, that's a breach of her privacy. Trust is important in a relationship, and assuming she's not being honest could damage that. Also, she might feel like he doesn't trust her, which is a big deal. The mood was ruined, and she's still not talking. So while his fear of unintended pregnancy is valid, the way he handled it was probably not the best. He should have had an open conversation instead of demanding to see it. So the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
