  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking my (23m) GF (21f) of 11 months to see her birthcontrol?\nSo, the title pretty much says it all.\n\nWe were getting in the mood to wrestle naked and while putting the condom on I asked if she was using birth control. I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The guy asked his girlfriend to show him her birth control for the first time they were about to have sex. The girlfriend is 21, he's 23, and they've been together 11 months. They had discussed the topic of children before, with him not wanting kids and her being on the fence. The main issue here is whether his request for visual evidence was wrong.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships. If they had already discussed it, maybe she was honest, and he's asking to see it to confirm. But that could be seen as distrustful. On the other hand, he's making a valid point about not wanting children, so he's trying to ensure there's no risk. But is it reasonable to ask for proof? Some might say that if they had the conversation and she said she was on birth control, then he should trust her. Others might say that in such a critical matter, wanting to verify is understandable.\n\nHowever, asking to see the actual pill or the packaging might cross a line. It could come off as controlling or not respecting her privacy. Also, the context is during a moment when they're about to have sex, which could be awkward and kill the mood. The fact that she was upset and didn't talk to him afterward suggests that his request hurt her feelings, possibly because she felt he didn't trust her.\n\nAnother angle: maybe she uses a different form of birth control that's not as easy to show (like an IUD or implant), and he's expecting her to have pills. Or maybe she was embarrassed to show it. The key here is communication. If he was concerned, maybe he should have discussed it earlier rather than demanding proof at the moment of intimacy.\n\nIn some cases, people do ask for proof, but it's important to consider why. If he's truly paranoid or needs absolute certainty due to not wanting children, that's valid, but the way he approached it might be the problem. The answer could hinge on whether the request was respectful and communicated well. Here, the request seems abrupt and possibly disrespectful, given the timing and the reaction it caused. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't trust her despite prior discussion and it led to a breakdown in communication.\n"
