I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. They were about to have sex, and he wanted visual proof that she's on it. He doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. He already had the discussion with her, but he wanted to see the pills.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider consent and trust in a relationship. Trust is a big part of any relationship, especially when it comes to something intimate like birth control. The guy is asking to see the pills because he's paranoid about her honesty. But is demanding visual proof a reasonable request? That could come off as distrustful. Even if they had discussed it before, asking to see the actual medication might be overstepping. It's not just about the birth control itself but about how the request is made. If she feels that he doesn't trust her, that could lead to tension. \n\nAlso, the context matters. They were in a romantic setting, and his request might have been too abrupt or pushy, ruining the mood. She might feel that her privacy was invaded. Birth control is a personal matter, and while he has a right to know about it for his own peace of mind, the way he's asking might not be the right approach. Maybe he should have discussed it more calmly and without demanding to see the pills in the moment. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's reaction. She stopped talking to him, which suggests she's hurt or offended. That's a sign that his request was inappropriate. If he's worried about her honesty, maybe he should have trusted her after their prior discussion, unless there's a reason to think she's being dishonest. Trust is a two-way street. \n\nBut then again, not wanting kids is a big deal. It's understandable that he wants to be sure. However, the method of asking for visual evidence is problematic. Open communication is key. Maybe he should have asked her to confirm again, but not in a way that makes her feel like he doesn't believe her. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong because he's not respecting her privacy and trust, even if his intention is to protect against unwanted pregnancy. The way he approached it was likely too intrusive and could damage the relationship. The answer is A.\n"
