I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old male in a relationship with a 21-year-old female for 11 months. During a moment when they're about to have sex, he asks her to show him her birth control, which upsets her and causes a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are consent, trust, and communication. The man has discussed his stance on not wanting children, and she mentioned being on the fence. He wants to ensure her honesty, so he asks to see her birth control. But the problem is that he's requesting visual evidence, which might be overstepping.\n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If the couple had already discussed the topic of birth control and her stance, asking for proof could imply a lack of trust. It's possible that his request to see it was a breach of her privacy. Even if his intention was to confirm honesty, the method might be intrusive. People might feel that this request is too demanding and not respectful of her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is that while he's concerned about unintended pregnancy, there are other ways to address that without asking for proof. For example, using condoms as he did, discussing her reliability on birth control, or having a conversation about backup methods. By asking to see the pills or a receipt, he shifts from a mutual discussion to a verification demand, which can be off-putting.\n\nAlso, considering the dynamics, she's on the fence about children, which suggests she might not be as committed to preventing pregnancy as he is. His request might have made her feel pressured or mistrusted, especially if she's already stated her position. It's possible that she felt her autonomy was being questioned, leading to the mood being ruined and communication breaking down.\n\nOn the other hand, he might genuinely be trying to protect against an unwanted pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, the way he approached it was problematic. Instead of trusting her account, he insisted on physical proof, which could be seen as controlling or not respecting her privacy.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the main issue is the method he used to verify her birth control use. While his intention to prevent pregnancy is understandable, the action of asking for visual evidence without considering her feelings and the trust in their relationship is what's at fault here. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong (Option A).\n"
