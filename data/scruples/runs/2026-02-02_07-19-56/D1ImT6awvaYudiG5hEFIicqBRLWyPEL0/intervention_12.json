  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking my (23m) GF (21f) of 11 months to see her birthcontrol?\nSo, the title pretty much says it all.\n\nWe were getting in the mood to wrestle naked and while putting the condom on I asked if she was using birth control. I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking to see his girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, and the guy wanted to confirm she was on birth control because he doesn't want kids. He had already discussed this with her before, but this time he wanted \"visual evidence\" so he asked to see it. It ruined the mood, and they didn't talk the next day.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships. If they had already talked about this before, maybe the author didn't trust her enough, which could be a red flag. Trust issues can cause problems. But on the other hand, he's being cautious about not wanting children. It's his right to be concerned about contraception.\n\nBut asking to see the actual birth control seems invasive. It's a private matter, and even if they discussed it before, requesting to see the pills or a prescription could be seen as not respecting her privacy. It might come off as controlling or not trusting her honesty. Even if his intention was to ensure they're on the same page, the way he approached it might have been too direct and lacking in consideration for her feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that it killed the mood and led to a breakdown in communication suggests that his approach was problematic. Instead of trusting the prior discussion, he needed more proof, which might indicate deeper trust issues. Healthy relationships require mutual trust, so this action could have been unnecessary and hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, if he's genuinely concerned about not having children and wants to make sure they're both taking precautions, he should communicate that concern without being intrusive. Maybe discussing it again in a calm setting would be better than asking for physical proof during an intimate moment.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author's action might be seen as overstepping, leading to the argument that he's in the wrong. The key factors are lack of trust, invasion of privacy, and the impact on their relationship dynamics.\n"
