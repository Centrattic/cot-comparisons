I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking to see his girlfriend's birth control. The key points here are consent, trust, and communication.\n\nFirst, the couple has been in a relationship for 11 months. The issue comes up during a moment of intimacy, where the author asks to see the birth control after putting on a condom. The girlfriend is 21, and they discussed their stance on children early on. The author mentions not wanting children, while she's on the fence.\n\nNow, the act of asking to see the birth control might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. Even if the author's intention was to confirm honesty, demanding proof in that moment could be perceived as distrustful. The girlfriend was clearly affected, as it killed the mood and led to silence afterward. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Asking for visual evidence of birth control could come off as not trusting her word, which she had already given in their earlier discussions. Unless there's a history of dishonesty, this request might be seen as excessive. Also, using a condom shows that the author is taking responsibility, but checking her birth control adds another layer that might not be necessary if both have agreed on contraception methods.\n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid\u2014ensuring that neither of them has children unintentionally. They had discussed it, but maybe the author felt the need for reassurance. But the method of asking to see the pill might be problematic. A better approach could have been discussing it more openly, checking in periodically, or perhaps using additional precautions if both are uncomfortable with relying solely on her birth control.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that the request was hurtful. It's possible she felt disrespected or doubted. The fact that they ended up not talking for the rest of the night indicates a significant emotional impact. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author's intention was to prevent pregnancy, the way he approached it might have been inconsiderate. Trust should be mutual. If the author is okay using a condom, perhaps he could have trusted her word about her birth control, especially since they had already discussed their positions on children. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would lean towards AITA being in the wrong because the request might have been an overstep, damaging trust and causing conflict when open communication could have addressed any concerns.\n"
