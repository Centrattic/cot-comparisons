I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see their girlfriend's birth control. The author is 23, the girlfriend is 21, and they've been together for 11 months. They had a discussion about not wanting children early on, but she's on the fence. Now, during a moment when they're about to have sex, he asks her to show him her birth control, which ruined the mood and led to a silence afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has expressed his stance on not wanting children before, and the girlfriend has said she's on the fence. Normally, if there's a mutual agreement to use protection, both should be responsible for their own methods. The fact that he's asking her to show him her birth control might be seen as a breach of privacy. Birth control is a personal health matter, and expecting someone to produce it on the spot could be stressful or uncomfortable for them.\n\nThen, there's the context of the situation. They were in a private, intimate moment when the condom was being put on. Bringing up the request to see her birth control at that exact time could be seen as inappropriate. It's possible that the girlfriend felt pressured or that her privacy was invaded, which explains the mood being killed. The author's motivation might be to ensure his partner is honest, but there are better ways to handle this. Trust is a key component in a relationship, so demanding visual proof might undermine that trust, even if his intention is to prevent an unexpected pregnancy.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is important. She didn't take the request well and didn't talk to him afterward. That suggests she felt the request was too intrusive. The author might not have considered her feelings about her privacy or how the timing of the request affected her. Even if he's being \"paranoid,\" as he calls it, his approach may not be respectful of her autonomy. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that he's trying to ensure he doesn't become a parent, which is a valid concern. The problem is the method he used to address his concern. Instead of asking to see it, he should have discussed this earlier, maybe set up a time to talk about it when they were both comfortable and not in the middle of an intimate moment. He could also have asked for reassurance or discussed other forms of protection, like using a condom as a backup. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial, but it's also about how and when you communicate. Asking during a moment of intimacy might not be the best approach. The girlfriend's hesitation or being on the fence about children could already be a source of tension. By requesting to see her birth control at that time, he might have made her feel like he doesn't trust her, which can create more issues than it solves.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate and a violation of privacy. He might be in the wrong because of the timing and the way he approached the request, even if his intentions were good. The correct answer here is likely A.\n"
