I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and he wanted to confirm she was on birth control because he doesn't want kids. They had discussed it before, but now he wanted to see proof.\n\nHmm. So, the author is concerned about honesty and wants assurance. But asking to see the actual birth control might be overstepping. Trust is important in relationships. They had talked about it early on, so maybe he should trust her word instead of demanding visual evidence. It killed the mood and caused a conflict. \n\nBirth control is a personal medical issue, and while it's important to discuss, demanding to see it can feel intrusive. The girlfriend might feel her privacy is invaded. Even if he has good intentions, the method of checking might be too pushy. They were already in a vulnerable situation, so this could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't talk after shows it was a big issue. Maybe he should have discussed it more calmly instead of making a demand. So, I think the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
