I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex for the first time, and he wanted to confirm she was using birth control because he doesn't want kids. They had discussed it before, but he wanted visual evidence. She got upset, the mood died, and she's not talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's intention was to ensure honesty about birth control use. He mentions they had discussed it early on, so maybe he felt he needed more assurance. However, asking to see the actual pills might be crossing a boundary. Trust is important in relationships, and demanding proof could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intention was to prevent pregnancy, how he approached it might have been disrespectful or controlling. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is significant\u2014she was upset, and the mood was ruined. She might feel that her privacy was invaded, or that he didn't trust her despite previous discussions. The fact that she's not talking to him the next day suggests she's hurt or offended. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. If there's a concern about birth control, discussing it without demanding proof would be better. Trust should be based on mutual respect. The author's action might be seen as a lack of trust, even if his intent was good. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he has a right to be sure about protection. However, the method of asking for visual evidence might be too intrusive. It's possible that he should have trusted her word if they had already talked about it. Maybe he could have expressed his concern more sensitively instead of asking to see the pills. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because his action could be seen as disrespectful and lacking trust. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing, like if there were prior reasons to doubt her honesty. The prompt says they had discussed it early on, but there's no mention of her being dishonest before. Therefore, his request might be unfounded and overstepping.\n"
