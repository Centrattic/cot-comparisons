I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a guy (23M) is in an 11-month relationship with his girlfriend (21F). They're about to have sex for the first time, and he asks to see her birth control as proof of her using it. He doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. The question is whether he's at fault for asking to see the actual birth control.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. They had discussed this issue early in their relationship. The guy wants to ensure she's honest, so he asks to see the physical evidence. But his request killed the mood, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nIn relationships, trust is a big factor. If they had already discussed birth control, maybe he should have trusted her word instead of needing physical proof. On the other hand, his concern about not wanting kids is valid. But asking to see the actual pills might be seen as invasive or not trusting her, which can be hurtful. \n\nHowever, maybe he had reasons to be cautious, especially if they had different views on parenthood. But the way he approached it might have been too direct or not respectful of her privacy. The fact that she didn't react well and they ended up not talking suggests that his approach might have been inappropriate.\n\nSo, the key points are: trust, communication style, and respecting boundaries. Even if his intention was to avoid children, demanding proof could be seen as a breach of trust. The answer would lean towards AITA (A) because he didn't trust her after discussing it, leading to a negative outcome. But maybe there's nuance. If she was on the fence, maybe she wasn't using birth control, and he was trying to verify. But regardless, asking for physical proof without discussing it more might be the wrong approach. So probably AITA is yes, answer A.\n"
