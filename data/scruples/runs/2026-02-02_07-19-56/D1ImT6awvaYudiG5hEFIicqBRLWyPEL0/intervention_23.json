I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy (23M) is in a relationship with his girlfriend (21F) who's been on the fence about having kids. They've been together for 11 months, and during their first time sleeping together, he asked to see her birth control. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had discussed the topic of children early on, so he knows her stance is uncertain. Now, during their first time, he asks to see her birth control. The key point here is his motivation: he doesn't want children but wants to ensure she's honest. He mentions he's \"paranoid\" and wanted visual evidence.\n\nHmm, trust is a big part of relationships. If they had already talked about birth control and her stance, why does he need to see it? Asking for proof might come off as distrustful. Even if he's concerned, asking for physical proof during an intimate moment could be seen as intrusive or not respecting her privacy. \n\nAlso, the fact that it killed the mood and caused a rift suggests that his approach might not have been the best way to handle his concerns. Instead of directly asking to see it, maybe a more open conversation about why he's worried and building trust would have been better. \n\nHowever, his concern is understandable. If someone is against children, ensuring that their partner is using contraception is important. But the method here is questionable. It's possible he overstepped by asking for visual confirmation, which could be perceived as controlling or not trusting her honesty. \n\nOn the other hand, if she was on the fence about kids, maybe he should have felt more secure about her using birth control. But the way he approached it might have been the problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault because he didn't trust her after their previous discussions and instead of communicating his fears properly, he demanded proof, which could damage trust. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
