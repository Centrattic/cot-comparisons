I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a guy asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. The guy is 23, the girlfriend is 21, and they've been together for 11 months. They had discussed the topic of children early on, and he's against it, while she's on the fence. The first time they're about to sleep together, he asks to see her birth control. She gets upset, the mood is ruined, and they don't talk the next day.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy's intention: he wants to confirm she's using birth control because he doesn't want kids. They had already discussed this, so maybe he felt the need for reassurance. But asking to see it for the first time during a moment of intimacy might be too direct, even if it's to confirm honesty. Maybe he should have asked earlier or in a different way.\n\nThen, the girlfriend's reaction: she gets upset, mood is killed, and she doesn't talk to him the next day. That suggests she felt her privacy was invaded. Birth control is a personal medical matter, and showing it might be intrusive. Even though he's concerned about pregnancy, the method of asking during a sexual moment could be seen as pressuring or not respecting her boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If they had already discussed birth control and she said she's on it, maybe he should trust her word rather than demanding proof. Asking for visual evidence might come off as distrustful, which can hurt the relationship. However, his concern is valid since he doesn't want children, so he's trying to protect himself.\n\nFactors to consider: How was the question asked? Was it respectful? Timing during intimacy might have been awkward. Also, in some places, birth control prescriptions are private, so she might not have the pill on hand. Maybe she felt humiliated or that her privacy was respected.\n\nPossible counterpoints: He's being responsible about not wanting kids, so his request is from a place of wanting to be safe. But the method could be the issue. Maybe he should have asked sooner or discussed it more openly instead of during a sexual encounter.\n\nSo, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the request was respectful and appropriate. Since it seems like it was during a moment of intimacy and led to her upset, it's more likely that he overstepped, making him the asshole. Therefore, answer A.\n"
