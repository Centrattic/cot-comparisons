I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a given situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a man (23M) wanting to see his girlfriend's (21F) birth control as a way to ensure her honesty, which led to a conflict. They had discussed the topic before, but this specific request seems to have caused a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The man's intention was to confirm she's using birth control, which is important for him because he doesn't want children. They had a prior discussion about this. However, instead of trusting her word, he wanted visual evidence. This action led to her being upset, the mood breaking, and them not talking for a day.\n\nNow, considering relationships and trust. Trust is a crucial element. If they've already discussed the topic and she said she's on the fence, but he's concerned about her honesty, maybe he should have addressed his trust issues another way. Asking to see the birth control could be seen as invasive and not respecting her privacy. Birth control is a personal medical issue, and unless there's a specific reason to doubt her (like a history of dishonesty), demanding proof might not be appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, his concern is valid. He doesn't want children, so ensuring that she's taking precautions is important. However, the method he used to ensure that might be problematic. Instead of asking to see it, maybe he should have had an open conversation about his fears and maybe suggested using a condom as a backup, which they were already doing. \n\nThe reaction from the girlfriend is also a point. She was upset, which suggests that the request was taken as a breach of trust. Relationships require mutual respect, and pushing for proof might not be the best approach. It's possible that the man's action was a result of anxiety, but it's important to communicate trust in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the man might be in the wrong because he didn't trust her word and instead asked for visual evidence, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, his intentions were to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, which is understandable. The key is how he handled it. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the approach was invasive and based on distrust without prior issues.\n"
