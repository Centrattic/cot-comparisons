      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy (23M) asked his girlfriend (21F, 11 months together) to show him her birth control. They were about to have sex, and he wanted visual proof she was on it because he doesn't want kids but she's on the fence. They had talked about it before, but this request killed the mood and now she's not talking to him.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective is that he's trying to ensure they're on the same page about contraception. He had a previous discussion where she said she was on the fence, so maybe he's worried she might be using birth control inconsistently or not at all. His approach was to ask to see the actual medication, which might come off as demanding or not trusting her, even if his intention is to be responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that being asked to show her birth control is an invasion of privacy. It's not just a verbal confirmation but a visual one. That could be seen as a lack of trust, especially in a relationship that's been going for 11 months. Even though they discussed it before, bringing it up at the moment of intimacy might be stressful for her. She might feel that he's not respecting her autonomy or that he's being controlling. Also, the fact that they ended up not talking for the rest of the night and she's still mad suggests that his request was a big deal for her emotionally.\n\nNow, considering societal norms. While it's common for couples to discuss birth control and have trust in each other's statements, some might argue that if there's lingering doubt due to past uncertainty (she's on the fence), seeking some form of verification isn't entirely unreasonable. However, the method of verification here\u2014demanding to see the actual pill\u2014is a bit problematic. It's a private health matter, and the timing (during a romantic moment) might have added to the tension.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The guy had a conversation early on, but maybe there's a breakdown in communication now. Instead of asking to see the pills, maybe he should have had a more open discussion about her current status with birth control, expressing his concerns without making her feel interrogated. The fact that he went from a discussion to a direct request for physical proof might have been too abrupt and not respectful of her privacy.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the girl didn't talk to him for the next day. That indicates that the request affected her significantly. If he truly wanted to build trust, demanding proof might have the opposite effect. Trust is a two-way street; if he's doubting her honesty, that could erode the trust in the relationship.\n\nBut some might argue that in matters of contraception and potential parenthood, it's better to be cautious. If he's adamant about not having children, and she's still undecided, maybe they need a more thorough conversation about their future plans rather than just verifying birth control use. The request might not address the underlying issue of differing views on having children.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy's intention is to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, which is valid. However, the method he used could be seen as invasive and disrespectful. The wrong part is the approach rather than the concern itself. So the answer is probably A\u2014the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with sufficient trust in his partner's honesty and chose a method that was intrusive.\n"
