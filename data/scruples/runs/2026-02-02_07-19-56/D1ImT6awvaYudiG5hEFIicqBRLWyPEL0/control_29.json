I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, he asked if she was on birth control, and when she said she was on the fence, he asked to see it. Now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 23, GF is 21, 11 months together. They had discussed the topic early on, so maybe he felt like he needed confirmation. But is asking to see the actual birth control a reasonable request?\n\nWell, birth control can be a sensitive topic. Maybe the GF felt disrespected or not trusted. Even if they talked about it before, asking to see the physical evidence during a moment when they're about to have sex might come off as controlling or not trusting her. That could definitely kill the mood and make her feel like he doesn't believe her.\n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't talk for the rest of the night and she's still not responding the next day suggests that the request was a big deal to her. It's possible she felt embarrassed, violated, or that he overstepped. Even if his intention was to confirm her honesty, the method might have been wrong. Trust is important in relationships, and making someone show proof could be seen as undermining that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about not wanting children is valid. He might be trying to ensure they're both on the same page. But maybe there's a better way to handle it, like having an open discussion rather than a demand for physical proof. The key here is whether the request was respectful and considerate of her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If they had already discussed it, and she's on the fence, maybe the author should focus on continuing that conversation instead of making her show proof. It's possible that he didn't consider how his request would make her feel, which is why it caused a conflict. So, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his needs in a respectful way, which led to a breach of trust and hurt feelings.\n"
