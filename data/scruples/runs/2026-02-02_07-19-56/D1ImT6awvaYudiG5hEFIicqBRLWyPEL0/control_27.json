I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The guy is 23, his girlfriend is 21, and they've been together for 11 months. They were about to have sex, and he asked her to show him her birth control. He doesn't want kids in the future, but she's on the fence. They had discussed this early on, but when he asked to see the physical proof, it ruined the mood, and she didn't talk to him after that. Now he's wondering if he's the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. They had talked about family planning before, so maybe he had some concerns about her honesty. But asking to see the actual birth control method might come off as distrustful or controlling. Birth control is a personal health decision, and while it's important for both partners to be on the same page regarding contraception, the way he approached it might have been invasive. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If he already had a conversation about it and she said she was using birth control, asking to see it could imply he doesn't trust her word. That might make her feel disrespected or like he's questioning her commitment. On the other hand, his intention might have been to ensure they're both safe and in agreement, but the method he chose could have been inappropriate. \n\nI should also think about the impact of his actions. The mood was ruined, and she hasn't spoken to him since. That suggests the request was hurtful. Maybe she felt pressured or that her autonomy was being questioned. Even if he was trying to be cautious, there's a difference between having an open discussion and demanding proof. \n\nAnother angle: if she's on the fence about having kids, maybe she's not using birth control consistently, or maybe she's using a different method. But instead of a respectful check-in, he went for a confrontational approach. It might have been better to discuss their mutual concerns and plans instead of asking for visual evidence.\n\nHowever, he might have had a legitimate fear of an unplanned pregnancy, especially since their views on children aren't aligned. But trust is a key component here. If they had already discussed it and she said she was using birth control, maybe he should have trusted her unless there was a reason to doubt her. \n\nAlso, the situation is that they were about to have sex, and he was putting on a condom. That shows he's taking responsibility, but he still wanted reassurance about her method. It's a bit of a double standard if she's expected to provide proof while he's already using a condom. Maybe they should have talked about their combined methods of contraception before the moment.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author's action of asking to see her birth control was a breach of trust and privacy. It's not about the right or wrong in a legal sense, but in terms of relationship dynamics. He might be in the wrong for not trusting her after their prior discussion and for making a personal health matter a point of contention at an inopportune time. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong)."
