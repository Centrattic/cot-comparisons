I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the guy is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. From the story, they've been in a relationship for 11 months, and they discussed birth control early on. The guy wants to make sure she's not pregnant before having sex, and he's asked her directly. Now, he's asking to see it because he wants \"visual evidence\" of her honesty.\n\nFirst, trust is a big component in relationships. If they had a conversation about this already, and she said she was on birth control, the guy is doubting her word. That might be a breach of trust. But on the other hand, he's concerned about unplanned pregnancy, which is valid. However, the way he approached it\u2014by asking to see the actual pill\u2014could be seen as invasive or not respecting her privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend was upset, and it killed the mood. If she already told him she was using birth control, he might be making her feel like he doesn't trust her. That could be hurtful. Also, there's a power dynamic here. He's the one initiating the request for proof, which can make her feel like he's not taking her word seriously. \n\nAnother angle: maybe she's on a type of birth control that isn't pills, like an IUD or implant, so asking to see the pill might not even be relevant. The guy might not be considering alternative methods, which is another point of contention. \n\nBut then again, if they were in a vulnerable moment, like about to have sex, bringing up this request could be seen as awkward and inconsiderate. It might have been a more appropriate topic to discuss in a non-intimate setting. \n\nSo, the question is whether the guy's actions were reasonable. While his concern is understandable, the method he used could be seen as disrespectful. Trust is important, and if the couple had already discussed this, he should trust her word unless there's a reason to doubt her. Asking for visual proof might be a breach of trust without a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's really anxious about this, maybe he should communicate better and maybe suggest alternative methods of birth control together, like using condoms consistently. But given the situation, his approach seems to have crossed a line. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. He didn't trust his partner's word after their prior discussion, and the way he approached it was probably too direct and possibly disrespectful, leading to the conflict.\n"
