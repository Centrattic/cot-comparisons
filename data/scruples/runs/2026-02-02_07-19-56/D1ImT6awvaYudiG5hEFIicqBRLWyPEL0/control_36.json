I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, and he wanted to make sure she was on birth control because he doesn't want kids. They had discussed this before, but he wanted visual confirmation. Now she's upset and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is concerned about not wanting children, which is a valid personal choice. They had already discussed it, so maybe she was honest, but he wanted to verify. But is that overstepping?\n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If they had already talked about birth control, maybe the author should have trusted her word. Asking for proof might come off as distrustful, which can hurt the other person's feelings. Even if he's paranoid, that doesn't excuse not trusting her. Also, the timing\u2014during a moment when they were about to be intimate\u2014might have been awkward and made her feel pressured or disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, he has a legitimate concern. But the way he approached it could be the problem. Instead of asking to see it in the heat of the moment, maybe he should have brought it up earlier or found a more respectful way to confirm. However, the fact that they had discussed it before and he still needed proof might indicate a lack of trust, which is a red flag.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't trust his partner's honesty after they had already discussed it, and his approach likely hurt her feelings and broke trust.\n"
