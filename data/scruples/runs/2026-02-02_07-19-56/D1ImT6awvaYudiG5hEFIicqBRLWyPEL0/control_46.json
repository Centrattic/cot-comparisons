I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to show her birth control. The situation involves a couple who has been together for 11 months. The man is 23, the woman 21. They were about to have sex for the first time, and the man asked to see her birth control as proof she's using it, leading to tension and the mood being ruined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They had discussed the topic of children before, and the man doesn't want kids, while she's on the fence. The key point here is the man's request to see the physical evidence of her birth control. Why would he do that? Maybe he's anxious about the possibility of her not being honest, which could lead to an unintended pregnancy. But is that a valid reason?\n\nBirth control is a personal health matter, and individuals often don't share such details unless they choose to. The woman might feel that her privacy is being invaded. Even if they had discussed it before, asking to see proof could be seen as distrustful. It's possible that the man's approach was too direct and not respectful of her boundaries. Communication is important in relationships, but doing so in a way that respects each other's autonomy is crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, the man's concern isn't unfounded. If both parties are not on the same page regarding contraception, it's a valid issue. However, the method of addressing it matters. Instead of demanding to see the pills, maybe a more open conversation about their feelings and ensuring mutual agreement would be better. Trust is foundational in relationships, and such a request could come off as a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, considering the woman's reaction\u2014killed the mood and not talking the next day\u2014indicates that the request was hurtful or made her uncomfortable. The man might have acted out of fear or anxiety, but it's important to handle sensitive topics with empathy and respect. The fact that they had already discussed this earlier suggests that the woman already communicated her stance, and the man's need for physical proof might be an overreaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a balance. The man has a right to be safe from unintended pregnancy, but the way he approached it could be problematic. The woman should also be open about her contraception if they haven't reached an agreement, but it's her decision whether to disclose that. So, the man's action might be seen as overstepping, hence he could be in the wrong (A). Alternatively, if the woman isn't being honest, he might have a point, but since the request led to conflict, it's more likely that his approach was inappropriate.\n"
