I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control. The situation is that they were about to have sex, he asked about birth control because he doesn't want kids and she's on the fence. He wanted to make sure she's using it, so he asked to see the actual pill or whatever. That made her upset, killed the mood, and they didn't talk after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries and trust in a relationship. Birth control is a personal health matter. Even if they discussed it before, asking to see the physical evidence might be crossing a line. He trusts her, but he wanted proof, which could be seen as not trusting her honesty. That might be a breach of privacy. Also, bringing it up right before intimacy could be awkward and stressful. Maybe there's a better way to communicate his concerns, like talking about it without demanding proof. The fact that it killed the mood and she's still upset suggests it's a sensitive topic. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her privacy and for approaching the issue in a way that caused tension. So answer A.\n"
