I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for asking to see his girlfriend's birth control. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is 23, his girlfriend is 21, they've been together for 11 months. They were about to have sex, he put a condom on, then asked if she was using birth control. He doesn't want kids, she's on the fence. He wanted to see her birth control as proof of honesty. It ruined the mood, and now she's not talking to him. He's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. Let's think about consent and trust here. Birth control is a personal medical choice. Asking to see it might come off as distrustful. Even if they had discussed it before, the act of demanding visual proof could be seen as invasive. Trust is important in relationships, so maybe he overstepped by not trusting her word. But on the other hand, he's trying to ensure they're on the same page about not having kids. However, there's a better way to handle this, like discussing it more openly without prying into personal health information. \n\nAlso, the context: he's using a condom, which is an effective method. If she's on birth control, maybe he's being redundant. But maybe he's just extra cautious. However, the way he asked (demanding to see it) could be disrespectful. She might feel her autonomy is being questioned. So, yeah, he might be in the wrong for not trusting her after they'd already had the conversation. \n\nBut wait, maybe he's just trying to be safe. However, trust is key. If she already told him she's on birth control, he should trust her unless there's a good reason not to. So the answer is probably A\u2014he's in the wrong for not respecting her privacy and trust.\n"
