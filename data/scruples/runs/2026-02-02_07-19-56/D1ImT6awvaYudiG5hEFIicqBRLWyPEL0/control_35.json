I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy (23) asking his girlfriend (21) to show him her birth control. They've been dating 11 months and had discussed her being on the fence about having children. The guy doesn't want kids in the future. They were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control for the first time, which ruined the mood and caused a silence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their previous discussions. They had already talked about this early in the relationship. The guy's request might stem from wanting reassurance, but maybe he didn't trust her enough to take her word. The problem here is about trust and communication. If they had discussed it before, maybe the guy didn't need to ask for proof now. However, it's also about mutual respect in a relationship. Trust is a big factor. Does he have the right to demand proof? That could be seen as controlling or not trusting her. On the other hand, his concern about not wanting children is valid, so he might be trying to protect himself. But instead of creating a confrontation, maybe he should have discussed it again earlier. The timing\u2014right before intimacy\u2014might have been awkward, contributing to the mood being killed. Also, she might feel disrespected. The answer would depend on whether his actions were reasonable given their prior communication. If they had already agreed on some level, asking for proof could be seen as the wrong move. So the author might be in the wrong (A) because he didn't trust her after discussing it and chose a bad time. Alternatively, if there was no clear agreement, maybe he's not wrong (B). But given that they had discussed it before, the fact that he needed visual proof suggests a lack of trust, which is a red flag in relationships. So likely A.\n"
