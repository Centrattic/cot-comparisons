I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 23-year-old male in an 11-month relationship with a 21-year-old girlfriend. The situation involves him asking to see her birth control as a way to confirm she's using it, after discussing their future child plans early on. They were about to have sex for the first time, and he wanted visual proof. The result was that it killed the mood, they didn't talk the rest of the night, and she hasn't responded the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is a key component. The author mentions that they've already discussed the topic of children and birth control early on. If she said she was on birth control, then trusting her word might be expected. By asking to see it, he could be seen as not trusting her, which might be a breach of trust. Even if he's paranoid (as he admits), actions like that can make the other person feel disrespected or not trusted. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's being cautious. He doesn't want children, and she's on the fence. So, ensuring that there's some form of protection is important. But the method he chose\u2014asking to see the physical proof\u2014might not be the best approach. There could be other ways to address his concerns, like discussing and agreeing on a method of protection that both are comfortable with, rather than demanding to see it. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and how the question was posed. If he asked in a way that felt confrontational or distrustful during a romantic moment, it could be off-putting. It's possible that the timing and manner of the question contributed to the mood being ruined. \n\nAnother angle is the importance of communication. They had discussed the topic before, so maybe instead of asking to see the birth control, he should have revisited the conversation to express his concerns and ensure they were on the same page. This scenario highlights a breakdown in communication where instead of trusting verbal communication, he sought physical evidence, which might not be necessary if they had clear prior agreements.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's action of asking to see the birth control might be seen as a breach of trust, even if his intentions were to ensure safe sex. The way he approached it could have been disrespectful or not trusting, leading to the negative reaction from his girlfriend. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong because it's about trust and respecting the prior communication without needing physical proof.\n"
