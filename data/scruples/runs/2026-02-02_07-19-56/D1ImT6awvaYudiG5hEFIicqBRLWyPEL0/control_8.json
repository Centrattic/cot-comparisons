I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy (23M) asking his girlfriend (21F) to show him her birth control. They've been dating for 11 months, and this is their first time sleeping together. The guy doesn't want kids, but the girl is on the fence. He asked to see her birth control during a moment of intimacy, which made her upset and the mood died. Now she's not talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy's intention was to confirm her honesty, which he attributes to being paranoid. But is his request reasonable? Birth control is a personal medical decision, and the fact that he's asking for visual proof might come off as distrustful. Even if they discussed it early on, requesting to see the actual pills could be seen as intrusive. Trust is a big component in relationships, and such a request might undermine that. The girl might feel her privacy is invaded or that he's not respecting her autonomy in her health decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's concern is valid because they have conflicting views on having children. It's important for both partners to be on the same page regarding contraception. However, the method he used to confirm her use might be problematic. Instead of asking to see it during an intimate moment, he could have discussed it more openly and respectfully. His approach might have been abrupt and lacking in empathy, leading to the breakup of the mood and the subsequent silence from the girl.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the girl felt pressured or that her privacy was disrespected. Birth control is a sensitive topic, and seeing her actual pills might be an overstep. Trust shouldn't solely rely on visual proof but on open communication. The fact that they had the discussion early on suggests they agreed on something, so the need for proof could indicate underlying trust issues. The guy's action might be a breach of trust, even if his intent was to be cautious.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the guy had concerns, perhaps he should have approached it differently, maybe by checking in with her about her commitment to using birth control through conversation rather than demanding to see it. The way he asked, during a moment of intimacy, could be seen as using pressure and might have made her feel uncomfortable or mistrusted.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action seems to be an overreach. While his concern is understandable, the method he used to verify her use of birth control was invasive and likely hurtful. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
