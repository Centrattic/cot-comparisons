I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to see his girlfriend's birth control. They're 11 months into the relationship, and the main issue is about birth control and trust.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they discussed having kids in the future early on. The GF is 21, so maybe she's still figuring things out, and he's 23, wanting to make sure. He says he's not into kids, she's on the fence. That's important because it shows they've had the conversation before, but maybe not enough details.\n\nHe wants to see the birth control, which is a request for proof. The GF says they ended up not talking after that, and she went home. Now there's a cold shoulder the next day. The user is asking if he was wrong (AITA).\n\nSo, is asking to see birth control wrong? Well, trust is a big part of relationships. If they've already discussed it and she said she's on birth control, he might be feeling insecure. But demanding to see it can come off as distrustful. Even if his intention is to confirm honesty, the way he's doing it might be invasive. Birth control is a personal health matter, and people might not be comfortable sharing that. \n\nHe says it killed the mood, which suggests she felt disrespected or not trusted. Maybe she felt he didn't believe her word. In relationships, trust should be built on communication and mutual respect. If he's not comfortable with her answer, maybe he should talk about his fears instead of asking to see the physical item. \n\nAlso, considering she's 21 and he's 23, maybe she's more sensitive about her autonomy. The fact that they didn't follow up after that might indicate a communication breakdown. He should probably reach out and explain his feelings, and listen to hers. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's possible the author overstepped by asking for proof instead of trusting her word. But maybe his intention was to prevent a pregnancy, which is understandable. However, the method was questionable. So leaning towards AITA being A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the request could be seen as a breach of privacy and not trusting her, even if his motives were to avoid an unintended pregnancy. The key here is that trust should be based on mutual communication, not demands for personal medical proof.\n"
