I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking to see his girlfriend's birth control. The situation is that they're in a 11-month relationship, the guy is 23, the girl 21. They had a discussion about future children early on, and the guy doesn't want kids but she's on the fence. Now, during a moment when they're getting intimate, he asks to see her birth control. She becomes upset, the mood dies, and they don't talk the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and trust in a relationship. Birth control is a personal health matter, and while discussing it is important, asking for visual evidence might be crossing a boundary. Even though the guy has concerns about future children, invading her privacy like that could be seen as distrustful. Relationships require trust, and this action might have eroded that. Also, their initial discussion about children was early on, so maybe he should have respected her privacy and discussed it more openly instead of demanding proof. The fact that it killed the mood and led to silence the next day suggests she felt disrespected or violated. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
