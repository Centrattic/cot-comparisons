I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The guy is 23, his girlfriend is 21, they've been together for 11 months. They had a discussion early on about not wanting children, and she says she's on the fence. Now, during their first time sleeping together, he asks to see her birth control. She got upset, the mood was ruined, and they didn't talk after that.\n\nFirst, trust is a big part of relationships. He's asking to see her birth control to verify she's honest. But does that cross a line? Even if they discussed it before, asking to see it in person might be overstepping. Maybe he's being paranoid, as he mentions, but is that justified? He could have just trusted her word if they had already talked about it. However, he's concerned about not wanting kids, so it's a valid concern. But making her show the physical evidence might be an invasion of privacy. Birth control is a personal matter, and she might feel disrespected or not trusted. \n\nAlso, the context of asking during a romantic moment could be awkward. It's possible that the way he brought it up was inconsiderate. Even if his intent was to ensure safety, the method might have been poor. Communication is key, but doing it at the moment of intimacy might not be the best approach. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not the one using the birth control, so maybe he should trust her. But if she's on the fence about kids, maybe he's worried she might change her mind or not be consistent with the pill. However, asking to see it could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It seems like yes. He should have trusted her word after discussing it, and asking to see the physical proof might be a breach of trust. The fact that she got upset and they didn't talk shows that it hurt her feelings. He should have approached the conversation in a more respectful and non-confrontational way earlier, rather than during the intimacy moment. Therefore, the answer is probably A.\n"
