I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy (23M) in an 11-month relationship with a girlfriend (21F). They were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control. He doesn't want kids in the future, while she's on the fence about it. He wanted visual proof of her honesty, which he says led to a broken mood and no communication the next day.\n\nHmm. The key points here: he asked to see her birth control for the first time when they were about to have sex. They had discussed this earlier, but he wanted to confirm her honesty by seeing it. She got upset, and now there's a cold shoulder.\n\nI think the main issue is about trust. In a relationship, especially after 11 months, does one partner have the right to demand proof like that? Even if he's concerned about not wanting children, asking to see the birth control could come off as distrustful. She might feel that he's not respecting her privacy or her word. They had discussed it before, so maybe he should have trusted her based on that conversation instead of needing physical evidence. That might be seen as being controlling or not trusting her, which can be a big turn-off.\n\nOn the other hand, he might be genuinely worried about an unwanted pregnancy. If she's on the fence about kids, maybe his request was to ensure she's taking precautions. But there's a balance between being cautious and being overbearing. Condoms are a shared responsibility, and if he's using a condom, maybe that's enough backup. Also, there are other ways to confirm without being intrusive\u2014like talking about it, but not demanding to see the actual birth control.\n\nAnother angle: maybe he should have approached it differently. Instead of asking to see it during the moment, perhaps discussing it more openly beforehand. But the fact that he waited until the last minute and then asked for proof could be the problem.\n\nSo considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong. Trust is crucial in relationships, and demanding proof like that could damage it. Even if his intentions were to prevent pregnancy, the method was inappropriate. So answer A.\n"
