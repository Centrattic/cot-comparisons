I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to see her birth control. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a 11-month relationship. The guy is 23, the girl is 21. They were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control. He doesn't want kids, she's on the fence. He wanted visual confirmation of her honesty. The request killed the mood, they didn't talk the rest of the night, and now she hasn't responded the next day.\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust and communication. The guy's reasoning is that he's being cautious because he doesn't want children. But he's asking for proof, which might come off as distrustful. Even if they discussed it early on, asking to see the actual pills or prescriptions could be seen as invasive. Trust in a relationship is important, and this request might have crossed a line.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not wrong in wanting to ensure they're on the same page about contraception. But the way he approached it\u2014asking to see it\u2014might not be the best method. Maybe he should have had a more open conversation instead of demanding proof. The fact that it ruined the moment suggests that his approach was off.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he had good intentions (not wanting kids), but his method of verifying her honesty might have been problematic. Trust issues can lead to such requests, but it's important to communicate without being invasive. The girl might feel disrespected, thinking he doesn't trust her. That could explain why she's upset. So, while his intent was to be cautious, the action could be seen as a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong).\n"
