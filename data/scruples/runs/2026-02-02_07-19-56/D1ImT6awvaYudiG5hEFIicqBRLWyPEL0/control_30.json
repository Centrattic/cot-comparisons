I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy (23M) and his girlfriend (21F) who've been together for 11 months. They were about to have sex, and he asked to see her birth control as proof she's using it. They had discussed this earlier, but now he wanted visual confirmation. The GF is upset, and they ended up not talking the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy doesn't want kids, and the GF is on the fence. They had talked about this before. The key point here is him asking to see the birth control. Is that reasonable or overstepping?\n\nBirth control is a personal medical issue. Asking to see it might be seen as a request for privacy invasion. Even if they discussed it earlier, wanting to verify could come off as distrustful. Trust is important in relationships. If he's worried about her honesty, maybe he should have addressed that through communication instead of demanding proof. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's concern about not wanting children is valid. But the method he used to ensure that might be the problem. Maybe he should have communicated his needs better rather than asking for proof. The GF's reaction\u2014mood killed, no communication the next day\u2014suggests that the request was hurtful or made her feel disrespected.\n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If he's not trusting her based on previous conversations, that could indicate his own issues with trust. Also, birth control is a personal choice and a medical detail; sharing that info isn't typically expected unless both parties agree. So, the act of asking to see it could be crossing a boundary. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
