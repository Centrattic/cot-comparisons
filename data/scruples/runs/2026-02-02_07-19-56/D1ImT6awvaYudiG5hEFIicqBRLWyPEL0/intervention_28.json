I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a guy, is in a relationship with his 21-year-old girlfriend for 11 months. They were about to have sex, and he asked her to show him her birth control as visual evidence she's honest about using it. He doesn't want kids, and she's on the fence. They had talked about this early on, but now he's asking to see it, which ruined the mood, and she hasn't talked to him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of a relationship. The author mentions they had already discussed birth control early in the relationship, so he knew about her stance. But now, during a moment of intimacy, he's asking for proof. That might come off as distrustful or not respecting her privacy. Birth control is a personal medical matter; asking to see it could be seen as invasive. Even if he's \"paranoid,\" it's possible that his approach was too direct and undermined the trust she expected from him. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to ensure that they're both on the same page regarding contraception, which is a responsible approach. But the method of asking to see the actual birth control during a vulnerable moment might be the issue. Maybe he should have had a more open conversation instead of demanding proof at that time. It's important to think about how his actions made her feel. If the mood was killed and she's upset, it might be because she felt disrespected or not trusted. \n\nAlso, considering consent and mutual respect, bringing up such a request during a sexual moment might not be the best timing. It could make her feel like he's not considering her feelings or the situation's sensitivity. Relationships require communication, but the timing and approach matter. He might have been in the wrong for not handling the request more sensitively. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because his request for visual proof during an intimate moment may have been too intrusive and could have damaged trust and respect in the relationship.\n"
