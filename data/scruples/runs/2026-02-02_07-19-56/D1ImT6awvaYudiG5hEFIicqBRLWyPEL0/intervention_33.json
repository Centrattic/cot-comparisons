I don't want children in the future but she says she's on the fence. We had this discussion very early on within the relationship. Everything seems fine about our relationship, but call me paranoid, I just wanted to have visual evidence that she was honest since this was the first time we were sleeping together.\n\nOnce I ask to see the birth control, it pretty much killed the mood for her and we ended up not talking for the rest of the night and me going home. Now it's the next day and she still hasn't talked to me.\n\nAll I'm wondering is AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy asking his girlfriend to show him her birth control for the first time they're having sex. The guy is 23, she's 21, they've been together 11 months. He doesn't want kids but she's on the fence. They had discussed this before. He wanted visual proof of her honesty, but it ruined the mood and now she's not talking to him.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether asking to see birth control is reasonable. Let's break it down. First, they had already discussed birth control early in the relationship. That's a good sign they had the conversation. But when it comes to the actual moment, he wants to see it. Maybe he's just being cautious, maybe a bit paranoid. But why would he need to see it? He's using a condom, so maybe he's double-checking. Or maybe he's not trusting her?\n\nIn relationships, trust is key. If he doesn't trust her after 11 months, that's a problem. But maybe he just wants to be 100% sure. However, asking to see the birth control might come off as controlling or distrustful. It could make her feel like he doesn't trust her, even if he meant it as just being cautious. The fact that it killed the mood suggests that she felt uncomfortable with the request. \n\nAnother angle: does he have the right to demand proof of her birth control use? Maybe not. It's her body, her choice. Even if they discussed it, he shouldn't have to see the actual pills or whatever. It's personal and maybe an invasion of privacy. She might have given her word, and he's not respecting that. \n\nAlso, using a condom is his responsibility for protection, so maybe he's overstepping by pressuring her to show him her method. The fact that he went home and she hasn't talked to him suggests that the request was hurtful. If he wanted reassurance, maybe he should have asked earlier or communicated his concerns in a different way. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong because he didn't trust her despite their prior discussion and his own condom use. It's about trust and respecting boundaries. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
