I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves their fianc\u00e9 reacting negatively to them getting a student suspended. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a librarian at a prek-12 school. They have to deal with young kids who sometimes touch their chest unintentionally. The author handles these incidents by gently guiding the kids, not getting angry because they're young and don't understand. Then, a high school senior sees a 6-year-old touching the author and makes a comment. The author tells the senior it's inappropriate, the senior gets defiant, grabs the author's chest, and the author suspends him. The principal agrees with the 3-day suspension and a call home. The author's fianc\u00e9, however, thinks the punishment is too harsh and compares it to the younger kids' actions.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's main arguments are that the senior was just a kid who didn't realize what he did, and that there's a double standard because the younger kids aren't punished the same way. The author argues that a 17-year-old should know better and that the senior's actions were intentional and more severe.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for taking disciplinary action? Well, the senior's action was intentional\u2014he grabbed the author's chest after being warned and seeing a younger child's accidental touch. The author took appropriate steps by reporting the incident, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to downplay the senior's responsibility and not consider the context of the situation. The author's actions were in line with maintaining a safe environment, especially given the age difference and intent. The fianc\u00e9's support in this situation is questionable, as he's defending the student's actions and criticizing the author's handling of the punishment. Breaking off the engagement because of lack of support might be justified if the person can't stand by their partner in a serious work-related issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for taking the action they did or for feeling unsupported, leading to the breakup. The fianc\u00e9's stance seems to misunderstand the severity and intent behind the senior's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
