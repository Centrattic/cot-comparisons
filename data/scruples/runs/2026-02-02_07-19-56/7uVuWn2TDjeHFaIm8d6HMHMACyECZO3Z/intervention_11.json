I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement due to their fianc\u00e9's reaction to them suspending a student.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian at a preK-12 school. They handle younger kids who sometimes grab their chest, which they handle gently because the kids are young and don't understand. Then, a high school student sees this and makes a comment. The author goes to him, tells him he's inappropriate, and threatens detention. The student gets lippy, grabs her, and she suspends him. The principal agrees with the 3-day suspension and a call home. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't support her, says it's a double standard, and accuses her of being unfair. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement. Now, her fianc\u00e9's friends are saying she's being unfair and rash.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide, I need to look at both sides.\n\nThe author's actions: She dealt with the younger kids appropriately, but when the older student touched her, she took action, leading to suspension. The principal supported the decision. The suspension also affects college records. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is the problem here\u2014dismissing her actions as unfair, not supporting her, and even blaming her for being a bad teacher. The author felt hurt and unsupported, leading to breaking off the engagement.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe she overreacted? But the student grabbed her, which is a serious incident. The principal agreed with the suspension. The author followed protocol. The fianc\u00e9's stance seems to downplay the severity of the high schooler's actions compared to the younger kids. At 17, the student should understand boundaries. The fianc\u00e9's comments might indicate a lack of respect for her professional judgment and personal boundary issues. The author's decision to leave because of his unsupportive attitude could be justified if the engagement was based on mutual respect.\n\nOn the other hand, if the fianc\u00e9 felt she was being harsh, maybe he had a point? But considering the circumstances, the author's actions were necessary for her safety and maintaining professionalism. The fianc\u00e9 not supporting her in a critical moment might show a lack of empathy. The author's decision to end the engagement because of feeling unsupported could be seen as reasonable, especially if the relationship couldn't handle such a fundamental disagreement.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author might not be in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's inability to support her in a serious situation is problematic. The author acted professionally, and the fianc\u00e9's criticism was invalid. Ending the engagement because of this could be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
