I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a librarian who got into a conflict with her fianc\u00e9 over suspending a high school student. The key points are: a student grabbed her chest, she took action leading to a suspension, and her fianc\u00e9 disagreed with the punishment, leading to the engagement breaking up.\n\nFirst, the author's actions. The student was grabbing her chest, which is sexual harassment. She went to the principal, and they decided on a 3-day suspension. That seems like a reasonable response given the situation. The 17-year-old was aware of his actions, as he made a comment before grabbing her. The younger kids grabbing her, she handles gently, but the high schooler's action was intentional. So the punishment seems justified, especially considering the age difference and intent.\n\nThen, her fianc\u00e9's reaction. He thought it was a joke and defended the student, comparing it to the younger kids' actions. He accused her of being unfair and targeting the student because she was involved in the punishment. That's problematic because he's dismissing her legitimate concern about harassment. The fianc\u00e9's stance undermines her experience and the severity of the situation. His friends also support him, calling her unfair, which adds pressure on her.\n\nThe author decided to leave the engagement because she felt unsupported. This is a personal decision, but is she in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9's reaction was dismissive and invalidating, then his behavior is the issue. The author's response was to end the engagement, which is her right if the relationship is toxic. However, some might argue that breaking up over this is overreacting, but given the context of being invalidated and the importance of mutual support, it's understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The suspension seems justified. Her fianc\u00e9's response was inappropriate. Her decision to leave is a personal choice based on feeling unsupported. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
