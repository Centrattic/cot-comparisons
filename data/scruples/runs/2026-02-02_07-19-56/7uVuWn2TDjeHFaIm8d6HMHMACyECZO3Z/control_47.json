I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, the situation: The librarian was dealing with a 6-year-old who accidentally touched her, which she handles routinely. Then a 17-year-old made a comment, grabbed her inappropriately, and was suspended. The fianc\u00e9 disagreed with the suspension, calling it a double standard and too harsh. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's actions: She dealt with the older student's intentional grab by suspending him. The student was 17, old enough to know right from wrong. The suspension was reported to colleges, which the fianc\u00e9 took issue with. The fianc\u00e9's reaction was to defend the older student, say it's a double standard, and criticize her for being unfair. The author felt this was a betrayal and ended the engagement.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9's reaction to her job decision seems problematic. Supporting a student's inappropriate behavior, especially when it's intentional, could be a red flag. The author's job requires maintaining appropriate boundaries with students, and the fianc\u00e9's lack of support in that area might indicate a bigger issue in their relationship. The author's decision to end the engagement because she felt unsupported seems justified given the context. The fianc\u00e9's friends also think she was unfair, but the core issue is his inability to support her professional actions, which are necessary for her job and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's argument about double standards\u2014comparing a 6-year-old to a 17-year-old\u2014might have some merit in terms of understanding intent. However, the age difference is significant, and the 17-year-old's action was deliberate. The author's handling of the situation was appropriate, so the fianc\u00e9's criticism is misplaced. The author's decision to leave is based on his lack of support for her professional conduct, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction was dismissive and unsupportive, which is a bigger issue. Therefore, answer B.\n"
