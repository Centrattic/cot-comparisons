I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe librarian is a teacher at a prek-12 school. She deals with kids grabbing her chest because they're young and don't realize it. She handles it by gently moving their hands, not getting mad. Then, a high school senior sees a younger kid grab her and makes a comment. She goes to talk to the senior, who then grabs her boob. She suspends him for three days, which gets reported to colleges. Her fianc\u00e9 is upset about the suspension being on the kid's record and says it's a double standard compared to younger kids. He thinks the punishment is too harsh and accuses her of targeting the student. The author breaks up with him because he's unsupportive and he's friends are critical of her. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, let's break down the key points. The high school student grabbed her, which is a serious issue. The principal supported the suspension, considering the context. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is that it's unfair to punish the older kid more than the younger ones, even though there's a big age difference. The author thinks there's a significant difference between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old in terms of understanding appropriateness and intent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up over this. The fianc\u00e9's stance is that the punishment is too harsh and the author is being unfair. The author left because she felt unsupported. The fianc\u00e9's friends are also accusing her of being rash. \n\nI think the main issue here is the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The author did her job as a teacher by addressing the inappropriate behavior, especially since the senior student was aware of what he was doing and made a joke about it. The 3-day suspension seems appropriate, given that he was scared and the principal agreed. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's a double standard ignores the age difference and intent. The author is in a position where she has to enforce rules, and her actions were taken in good faith. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 not supporting her and dismissing her concerns might be the problem here. The author felt hurt and unsupported, leading to the breakup. Whether she's in the wrong depends on if her decision to leave was justified. If she felt that her fianc\u00e9 was invalidating her professional judgment and her feelings of being targeted, then breaking up over that could be seen as justified. However, maybe the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that he's concerned about the student's future, but his approach was dismissive.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. She stood up for herself and her professional decisions. The fianc\u00e9's reaction was unsupportive and potentially undermining her as a professional. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
