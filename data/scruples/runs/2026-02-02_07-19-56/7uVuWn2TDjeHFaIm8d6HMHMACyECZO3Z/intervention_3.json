I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending her engagement because her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision to suspend a high school student who grabbed her breast. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author is a librarian at a PK-12 school. Young kids often grab her because they don't understand their actions, and she handles it gently. Then a 17-year-old sees a 6-year-old grabbing her and mocks her. The high schooler then grabs her, and she suspends him. The principal agrees with the 3-day suspension, which also needs to be reported to colleges. Her fianc\u00e9 is upset about this, saying it's a double standard, that the student was just joking, and that she's being unfair. She breaks things off because of his lack of support.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if she's right or not. \n\nThe author's actions seem justified. The high schooler's action was a sexual assault, even if he was a minor. The younger kids are not held to the same standard because they're too young to understand, but a 17-year-old should know better. The suspension is a school's disciplinary measure, and the principal supported it. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to minimize the incident, suggesting that the student was just being a joke and that the punishment is too harsh. That could indicate a lack of support for her safety and professionalism. \n\nEnding an engagement over such a significant disagreement is a big step, but if the fianc\u00e9 is not respecting her professionalism and the seriousness of the incident, it might be a red flag about his character. The author felt unsupported and hurt, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9's friends adding pressure by calling her unfair and rash might not help, but that's their perspective.\n\nThe key points are: the student's action was inappropriate and needed disciplinary action. The fianc\u00e9's response was dismissive and possibly invalidating her experience. The author's decision to end the engagement is based on his failure to support her in a serious situation. \n\nBut maybe the fianc\u00e9's argument about double standards isn't entirely wrong? The 6-year-olds aren't punished the same way. However, the 17-year-old is older and should be held accountable. The author's actions were appropriate as per the principal's agreement. The fianc\u00e9's stance might not consider the legal and ethical aspects of such a situation. In a relationship where one partner's job is under scrutiny, especially in a professional setting, the other partner's support is crucial. If the fianc\u00e9 can't support her, that shows a lack of respect for her career and safety. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to end the engagement might be justified. The fianc\u00e9's reaction was problematic, so she isn't necessarily in the wrong. But maybe there's nuance. Did she handle the situation correctly? The suspension was approved by the principal, so yes. The fianc\u00e9's comments about her being a \"bitch\" and telling her to \"take a joke\" are clearly inappropriate. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction was the main issue. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
