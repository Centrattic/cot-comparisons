I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a librarian at a school. A young student accidentally touches her, and a high schooler makes a comment, leading to the older student grabbing her. She reports him, leading to a suspension. Her fianc\u00e9 reacts negatively, defending the older student and criticizing her actions as unfair.\n\nThe author left the engagement because he didn't support her and thought her reaction was too harsh. Now, she's asking if she's the one at fault.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author did her job by addressing the inappropriate behavior. The high schooler's actions were intentional and more severe than the younger kids' accidental touches. The suspension was a disciplinary action, which is standard for such incidents, especially when they involve adults and minors. The principal agreed it was appropriate.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction seems problematic. He's defending the older student, comparing it to the younger kids' actions, which aren't the same. At 17, the student should understand the seriousness of touching a teacher. The fianc\u00e9's comments about the suspension affecting college records and calling it a \"joke\" show a lack of support and understanding. He accused the author of being unfair and targeting the student, which could indicate a lack of respect for her professional judgment.\n\nThe author felt unsupported and decided to end the engagement. Breaking up over this might be extreme, but if the fianc\u00e9 couldn't respect her decisions and supported the student's actions, it might be a red flag for future issues. The fianc\u00e9's friends also criticized her, which adds to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author acted within her role to maintain a safe environment. The fianc\u00e9's reaction was dismissive and unsupportive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The key factors are the fianc\u00e9's inability to support her during a stressful situation and the author feeling hurt and unsupported. Ending a relationship over such fundamental disagreements is a personal choice, but in this case, the fianc\u00e9's stance seems to undermine her professional integrity. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for leaving, given the circumstances.\n"
