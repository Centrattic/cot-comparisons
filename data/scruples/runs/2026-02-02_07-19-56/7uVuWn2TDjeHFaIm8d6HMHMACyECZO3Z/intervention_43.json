I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her getting a student suspended. The situation involves a 17-year-old grabbing her chest, leading to a 3-day suspension. The fianc\u00e9 thought the punishment was too harsh, comparing it to the younger kids who just grab her by accident. The author felt he was being unfair and left him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue. The main conflict here is about the fianc\u00e9's reaction and whether the author was right to leave him. The author had a valid reason for being upset because the 17-year-old intentionally grabbed her, which is a serious violation. The suspension seems appropriate, especially since the kid was being a smartass. The fianc\u00e9's stance that it's a double standard and that the punishment was too harsh could indicate a lack of support for her and possibly a dismissive attitude towards the seriousness of the incident.\n\nThe author's decision to end the engagement might be seen as a response to feeling unsupported and misunderstood. The fianc\u00e9's comments about her being an unfair teacher and telling her to \"take a joke\" are problematic. Those comments could suggest that he doesn't take her experiences seriously, which is a red flag in a relationship. The author's feelings of hurt and needing to leave for her well-being are valid. \n\nHowever, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe the fianc\u00e9's opinion is reasonable, or that the author overreacted. But considering the fianc\u00e9's lack of support and invalidating her experience, it's hard to see how the author is at fault. The key point is whether the fianc\u00e9's reaction was supportive. Since he didn't back her up and instead criticized her actions, the author's decision to end the engagement seems justified. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
