I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is a school librarian, had a student grab her inappropriately. She dealt with it by getting the student suspended, and then her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision. She ended the engagement because he didn't back her up. Now, people are asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, let's look at the incident itself. The high school student made a sexual comment, then grabbed her. The author took action, leading to a suspension. The principal agreed with the punishment. So, from a professional standpoint, her actions seem appropriate. The student was old enough to know better, and the suspension was decided jointly with the principal. The fact that the suspension needs to go on the student's record might be a point of contention, but the author probably followed school policies.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9's reaction. He's arguing that the punishment is too harsh and compares the high schooler to the younger kids who grab her. But the author points out that 6-year-olds don't understand their actions, whereas a 17-year-old should know better. The fianc\u00e9 is dismissing her experience and suggesting she's being unfair. His friends are also criticizing her, which adds pressure. The author felt unsupported and broke off the engagement because he wouldn't back her up.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for leaving? Well, the key here is whether her decision to end the engagement was justified given his lack of support. She's in a profession where dealing with such situations is part of the job, and having a partner who doesn't support her could be a red flag. The fianc\u00e9's comments about her being unfair and telling her to \"take a joke\" show a lack of empathy and understanding. If someone's partner can't support them in a professional matter like this, it might indicate deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overreacted by ending the engagement over this. But considering his friends are also criticizing her, it's possible that he's part of a social circle that doesn't respect her boundaries. The author's feelings of being unsupported and hurt are valid. Ending an engagement over such fundamental disagreements about respect and support is a significant decision, but in this context, it seems justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her fianc\u00e9's reactions were dismissive and unsupportive, and leaving the engagement because of that is a reasonable choice. The answer should be B.\n"
