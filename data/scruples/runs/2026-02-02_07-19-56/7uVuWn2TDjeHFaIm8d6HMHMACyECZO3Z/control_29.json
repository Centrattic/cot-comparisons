I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a librarian at a preK-12 school. She deals with younger kids who sometimes touch her chest unintentionally. She handles it by telling them to watch their hands or moving their hands gently. Then there's an incident where a 6-year-old stumbles and touches her chest. A high schooler sees this, makes a joke, and grabs her chest. She takes the high schooler to the office, gets a 3-day suspension, and reports it to colleges. Her fianc\u00e9 disagrees with her actions, saying it's a double standard because the younger kids aren't punished similarly. He accuses her of being unfair and targeting the student. She breaks up with him over this, and now people are questioning if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both angles. The key points here are the appropriateness of her actions in handling the high schooler's grab and whether her decision to suspend him was justified. Then, her fianc\u00e9's reaction and whether his criticism is valid.\n\nLooking at the incident: the high schooler, after making a joke, intentionally grabs her chest. She took him to the office, and the principal imposed a 3-day suspension. The author's reasoning is that a 17-year-old should know better, and the action was intentional, hence the suspension. Her fianc\u00e9 argues that since the younger kids do similar things unintentionally, it's a double standard. But there's a significant age difference\u20146 vs. 17. At 17, the student is expected to understand appropriate behavior, whereas a 6-year-old lacks that awareness. The author's actions seem reasonable given the context. The suspension also has consequences for the student's college applications, which the fianc\u00e9 takes issue with. However, the principal agreed with the punishment, indicating it was appropriate.\n\nRegarding the breakup: the author felt unsupported by her fianc\u00e9, especially when he accused her of being unfair and told her to \"take a joke.\" His reaction seems dismissive of her boundaries and the severity of the situation. If the fianc\u00e9 couldn't support her after she stood by her decision to address the harassment, it's understandable why the author might feel the engagement is over. The fianc\u00e9's friends also question her decision, but their opinions might not be relevant here.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She acted within her role to protect herself and maintain a respectful environment. Her fianc\u00e9's criticism seems to undermine her professional judgment and personal boundaries. The breakup was based on his lack of support and invalidation of her experience. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
