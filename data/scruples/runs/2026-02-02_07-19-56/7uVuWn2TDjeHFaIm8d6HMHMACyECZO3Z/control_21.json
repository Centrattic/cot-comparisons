I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement due to her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a librarian at a preK-12 school. She deals with younger kids who accidentally touch her, which she handles calmly. Then a high schooler makes a comment about it, grabs her, and she suspends him. The principal agreed with the suspension. The fianc\u00e9, however, criticized her actions, saying it was unfair to punish the older student more severely than the younger kids who also touched her. He accused her of being biased and targeting the student because she was involved in the decision. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement.\n\nNow, the key points here. The high school student intentionally grabbed the author after making a derogatory comment. The younger kids are younger and less aware, but the high schooler was clearly aware of his actions. The principal supported the suspension, indicating that it was appropriate. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to downplay the difference in age and intent, suggesting that the punishment is too harsh. \n\nThe author had a valid reason to take action against the high schooler, as his actions were intentional and inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9's criticism of her actions and the decision to suspend the student shows a lack of support and understanding for her professional and personal boundaries. The author's decision to end the engagement was a response to feeling that her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her in a situation where she was defending herself against harassment. \n\nIt's important to note that the fianc\u00e9 is not in a position to have authority over such decisions. The author acted within her professional role, and the fianc\u00e9's judgment here could be seen as undermining her autonomy and judgment. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's friends also criticized her, which adds pressure, but the author's primary issue was with the fianc\u00e9's lack of support. Given that the fianc\u00e9's reaction was dismissive and accusatory, the author's decision to end the engagement was a response to being in a relationship where her well-being and professional actions were not respected. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted appropriately in handling the student's misconduct and took justified actions. The fianc\u00e9's inability to support her in this situation, instead criticizing her, led to the breakup. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
