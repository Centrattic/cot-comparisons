I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The author is a librarian at a preK-12 school, and the situation involves a high school student grabbing her chest after a younger kid accidentally touched her. The author suspended the high schooler, leading to a conflict with her fianc\u00e9, who criticized her actions and their consequences. She ended the engagement over his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's actions: a 6-year-old touches her accidentally, which she's used to handling. Then a 17-year-old makes a comment and then physically grabs her. The author took him to the office, and they decided on a 3-day suspension. The principal supported the action. The author's fianc\u00e9, however, thinks it's a double standard because younger kids do the same but aren't punished. The fianc\u00e9 claims the 17-year-old \"just didn't realize what he was doing,\" but a 17-year-old should know better. The suspension affecting college records is a point of contention for the fianc\u00e9.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the appropriateness of the author's response to the high schooler's actions, the validity of the fianc\u00e9's argument about double standards, and whether the author was justified in ending the engagement over this disagreement.\n\nThe author's actions: The 17-year-old's behavior was intentional and disrespectful, unlike the 6-year-olds. The suspension was decided in conjunction with the principal, so it wasn't arbitrary. The author took reasonable steps to address a clear violation of conduct. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to minimize the severity of the high schooler's actions, possibly excusing behavior that's not excusable for someone that age. The author's decision to end the engagement is based on feeling unsupported and hurt by his response, which could indicate a lack of communication or differing values.\n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong: The author acted professionally in handling the incident, leading to a justified suspension. The fianc\u00e9's criticism of her actions and the author's decision to leave the engagement because of his unsupportive response might not make her the AITA. However, ending a relationship over a disagreement could be seen as rash. But given the context of feeling unsupported and the fianc\u00e9's defensiveness, it's more about their relationship's values than the author's actions in the situation.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She handled the incident appropriately, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction was unreasonable. Her decision to end the engagement is a personal choice based on their conflict, but it doesn't make her at fault.\n"
