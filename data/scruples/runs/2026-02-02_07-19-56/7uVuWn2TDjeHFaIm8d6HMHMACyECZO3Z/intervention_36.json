I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement over their fianc\u00e9's reaction to a student being suspended. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian who had an incident where a 6-year-old grabbed her, and then a 17-year-old student made a comment and then grabbed her. The author took action, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9 reacted by not supporting her decision, calling it a double standard and saying the punishment was too harsh.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author was wrong to end the engagement. The key points here are the fianc\u00e9's reaction and the author's decision-making. \n\nThe author's reasoning for leaving is that the fianc\u00e9 didn't support her, accused her of being unfair, and dismissed the seriousness of the 17-year-old's actions. The fianc\u00e9 also compared the 17-year-old's behavior to the younger kids', suggesting it's a double standard. However, there's a significant difference between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old in terms of maturity and understanding consequences. The 17-year-old was aware of his actions and did it intentionally after the younger child's accident, which was more about mocking the librarian. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to downplay the intentional harassment by the older student, which is a more serious issue. The author's actions followed appropriate procedures by reporting the incident, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9's criticism of her professional judgment might indicate a lack of respect for her work and decisions, which is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nWhen considering whether the author was in the wrong, it's important to evaluate if the fianc\u00e9's reaction was reasonable. His stance that the punishment was too harsh and that the author should \"take a joke\" is problematic, as it doesn't acknowledge the seriousness of the harassment. The author felt unsupported and hurt, leading to the engagement being broken off. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support and respect are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's inability to back the author during a stressful and serious situation might justify her decision to end things. The author's actions were in line with handling the situation professionally, and the fianc\u00e9's criticism could be seen as undermining her. \n\nSo, the fianc\u00e9's reaction was likely the bigger issue here. The author acted appropriately in her professional role, and her decision to leave based on lack of support from her partner might be understandable. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
