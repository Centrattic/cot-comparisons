I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, the situation: The librarian was touched inappropriately by a 6-year-old, then by a 17-year-old. She reported the 17-year-old, leading to a 3-day suspension and a call to his parents. The fianc\u00e9 criticized her for being unfair, especially since the younger kids aren't punished the same way. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the appropriateness of the punishment and the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The author's fianc\u00e9 is defending the older student, comparing him to the younger kids, and suggesting the punishment is too harsh. The author believes there's a significant difference in maturity between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old.\n\nNow, considering the fianc\u00e9's stance: He's arguing that the 17-year-old, being older, should be treated differently. However, the 17-year-old's actions were intentional, unlike the younger kids. The fianc\u00e9's comments that the author should \"take a joke\" seem dismissive of the serious nature of the harassment. \n\nIs the author wrong for breaking up? Well, the engagement is a personal decision. The fianc\u00e9's reaction shows he doesn't support her in a professional matter, which is crucial in a relationship. If someone can't support you in a work-related issue where you're standing up for yourself against harassment, that's a red flag. The author felt hurt and unsupported, which can be valid reasons to end a relationship. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's arguments seem to downplay the severity of the older student's actions, which could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding of workplace/educational boundaries. The author's decision to leave might be about more than just this incident\u2014maybe it's a pattern of not respecting her professional role. \n\nSo, while the punishment's fairness might be debatable, the fianc\u00e9's response is problematic. The author's choice to end the engagement for feeling unsupported is a personal decision, but given the fianc\u00e9's reaction, perhaps it's not entirely her fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
