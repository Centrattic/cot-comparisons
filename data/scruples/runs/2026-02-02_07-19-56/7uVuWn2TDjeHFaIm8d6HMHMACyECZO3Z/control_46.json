I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a librarian who got into a conflict with her fianc\u00e9 over her decision to suspend a high school student. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the librarian had a student (a 6-year-old) who accidentally touched her. She handles this by gently moving their hands, which seems appropriate since they're just little kids. Then a 17-year-old high school student sees this and makes a sarcastic comment. When she tells him to stop, he grabs her chest. She takes him to the office, and after discussion, he gets a 3-day suspension and a call home. The principal agrees with the punishment as the student was more of a smartass than a danger, but the suspension affects college records.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's issue is with the suspension being on the student's record. He argues that the 17-year-old didn't realize what he did and that it's a double standard compared to the younger kids. The author thinks there's a big difference between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old in terms of intent and understanding. The fianc\u00e9 accuses her of being unfair and targeting the student, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider:\n\n1. **The Student's Age and Intent**: The 17-year-old was fully aware of his actions. He made a comment, then escalated by grabbing her. The younger kids aren't expected to understand, but a 17-year-old should. So the author's decision to suspend him might be justified because of his intent and maturity.\n\n2. **Disciplinary Actions**: Schools often have policies for different age groups. The 6-year-olds are handled with leniency due to age, but a high school student's actions could have legal implications (like sexual harassment). The suspension being reported to colleges is a consequence for serious misconduct.\n\n3. **Fianc\u00e9's Reaction**: The fianc\u00e9's response seems to downplay the severity of the 17-year-old's actions. Comparing a 6-year-old's accidental touch to a 17-year-old's intentional grab is a flawed argument. The fianc\u00e9's support (or lack thereof) could be a red flag in their relationship.\n\n4. **Author's Actions**: The author followed protocol by reporting the incident, and the principal agreed with the punishment. The decision to suspend a high school student for such an act is reasonable, especially given the context of the student's behavior (smartass, scared, etc.).\n\nSo, the author acted appropriately in handling the student's misconduct. Her fianc\u00e9's criticism was about her being unfair, which doesn't hold up given the situation. The author's decision to leave because of his unsupportive reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
