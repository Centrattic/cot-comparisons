I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for ending her engagement after her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision to suspend a student. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman is a librarian at a school. She's dealing with kids grabbing her inappropriately. She handles the younger kids gently because they're not aware of their actions. Then a high school senior makes a comment about her and a younger kid, and then the senior grabs her. She takes action, suspends him, and the principal agrees with the punishment. \n\nHer fianc\u00e9 reacts by saying the high schooler was just a kid, that it's a double standard to punish him more than the younger kids, and accuses her of being unfair. He even tells her to take a joke and not be a bitch. She feels unsupported, breaks off the engagement, and now people are questioning if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo the main question is: Is she wrong for ending the engagement over this?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The woman had a valid reason to take action against the high schooler's inappropriate behavior. The senior was aware of what he was doing, unlike the younger kids. The suspension was deemed appropriate by the principal. Her fianc\u00e9, however, dismissed her actions as unfair, which could indicate a lack of support and understanding in a critical moment. \n\nIn relationships, especially engagements, mutual support is crucial. If one partner's actions are seen as undermining the other's professional decisions and judgment, that can be a serious issue. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to trivialize her experience and the severity of the senior's actions. His comments about the high schooler just being a kid and the need to \"take a joke\" suggest he's not taking her concerns seriously. This could lead to deeper issues if unresolved.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's just trying to see both sides, but his approach here was dismissive and unsupportive. The woman's decision to end the engagement because of this lack of support is understandable, especially if communication failed and he doubled down on his criticism.\n\nLegally, the suspension might be justified, but the question here is about the fianc\u00e9's reaction and the woman's decision to break off the engagement. Since the fianc\u00e9's response didn't consider her perspective and instead criticized her, leading to her feeling unsupported, she has grounds to end the engagement. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
