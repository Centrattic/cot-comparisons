I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her after she suspended a student. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The librarian is dealing with a 6-year-old grabbing her chest, which she handles by telling the kids to watch their hands. Then a 17-year-old sees this and makes a comment, then grabs her chest when she confronts him. She takes him to the office, and they decide on a 3-day suspension. \n\nHer fianc\u00e9 reacts by saying the high schooler didn't realize what he was doing, comparing him to the younger kids, and calling the punishment too harsh. He also accuses her of being unfair. She feels unsupported and breaks off the engagement.\n\nNow, the key points here are the fianc\u00e9's reaction. He's dismissing the severity of the 17-year-old's actions, especially since the teen was aware enough to make a joke and then grab her. The librarian is in a professional role, and handling such incidents is part of her job. The fianc\u00e9 not supporting her, instead side with the student, could indicate a lack of respect for her professional decisions and personal boundaries.\n\nShe left the engagement because she felt hurt and unsupported. The fianc\u00e9's friends are also criticizing her, which adds to the tension. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, support is crucial, especially in high-stress situations. If a partner undermines you over a significant issue, that can be a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9's stance suggests he doesn't take her experiences seriously, which could affect their future. So, she might not be in the wrong for leaving. \n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Did she overreact? The suspension was discussed with the principal, and they agreed. The fianc\u00e9's arguments about fairness and double standards might be valid in some contexts, but the difference between a 6-year-old and 17-year-old is significant. The older student's actions were intentional and more serious. So the fianc\u00e9's comparison might be invalid. \n\nIf the fianc\u00e9 can't respect her professional judgment and the seriousness of the incident, that's a problem. The author's decision to leave is about feeling unsupported, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
