I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a librarian who dealt with a 6-year-old grabbing her chest, which is a common issue with younger kids not understanding personal space. The older student, a 17-year-old, made a comment about it and then intentionally grabbed her. She took action, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9 criticized her for being unfair and overreacting, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are the differences in age and intent between the 6-year-old and the 17-year-old. The younger child's actions are accidental and due to immaturity, while the older student's act was deliberate and disrespectful. The fianc\u00e9 not only downplayed the severity but also accused the author of being biased, which is a significant issue in a relationship, especially when one partner's job involves enforcing discipline.\n\nThe author's decision to leave might be seen as a response to a lack of support and differing values. The fianc\u00e9's friends adding to the pressure by calling her unfair could also be a factor. The author's actions were within her professional duty, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he might not respect her professional decisions or the importance of setting boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, the fianc\u00e9's stance seems to be the problem. The author acted appropriately in her role, and the fianc\u00e9's lack of support led to the end of the engagement, which is a personal choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
