I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a librarian who got into a conflict with her fianc\u00e9 over how she handled a student's inappropriate behavior. The fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision and this led to the engagement being broken. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The librarian was helping a 6-year-old, who accidentally touched her. Then a 17-year-old witnessed this and made a joke, then grabbed her. The librarian took action, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9 thought the punishment was too harsh, especially since the 17-year-old's action was similar to the 6-year-olds but the younger kids weren't punished. The author felt the fianc\u00e9 was being unsupportive and unfair, leading her to leave.\n\nSo, the key points are: the librarian acted in her job to address harassment, the fianc\u00e9's reaction was critical, and the author ended the engagement because of that. The question is if the author is wrong for doing so.\n\nI need to assess each part. The librarian's actions: she handled a 6-year-old's accidental touch with understanding, which makes sense because young kids don't understand boundaries. The 17-year-old, however, made a deliberate, inappropriate comment and then physically harassed her. The librarian took him to the office, and the principal gave a 3-day suspension and a call home. The punishment seems appropriate given the student's age and the deliberate nature of the act. The 17-year-old was old enough to know better, so the suspension being reported to colleges is a consequence of his actions, not just a joke.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's issue is with the harshness of the punishment and the fact that it's on the student's record. He's comparing it to the 6-year-olds, but there's a big difference between a child's innocent action and a teenager's intentional misconduct. The fianc\u00e9 accused the author of being unfair and targeting the student, which seems incorrect. The author was following protocol, and the suspension wasn't just her decision\u2014it was discussed with the principal. The fianc\u00e9's support (or lack thereof) is the problem here. The author felt unsupported and hurt, leading to the breakup. \n\nSo, in terms of the author being in the wrong: she handled the situation professionally, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction was unsupportive and dismissive. The author had the right to take action against harassment and to seek a supportive partner. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
