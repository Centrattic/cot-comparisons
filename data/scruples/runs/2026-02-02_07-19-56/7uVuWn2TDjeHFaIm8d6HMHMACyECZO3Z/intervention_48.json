I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for ending the engagement because of her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, a librarian, deals with kids grabbing her inappropriately. When a 17-year-old mocks her and then grabs her, she takes action, leading to a suspension. Her fianc\u00e9 disapproves, saying the punishment is too harsh and that the older student is just a kid like the younger ones. He accuses her of being unfair and targeting the student because she was involved in the punishment. The author feels unsupported and ends the engagement.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is. Let me think.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's main arguments are that there's a double standard between 6-year-olds and 17-year-olds regarding the same behavior. The author argues that age makes a difference in intent and understanding. The fianc\u00e9 also says the suspension is too harsh, even though the student grabbed her after making a joke. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the 17-year-old is an adult in many ways and should understand right from wrong. The act of grabbing someone's chest is a serious violation, especially in a school setting. The suspension being reported to colleges might be a consequence, but maybe the fianc\u00e9 feels that's too much. However, the author had to maintain a safe environment, so taking action is justified.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is dismissing her experience and the appropriateness of her actions. He's undermining her judgment by calling her unfair and suggesting she shouldn't take it so seriously. This lack of support in a serious matter could be a significant issue in a relationship. \n\nEnding an engagement over such a disagreement is a big step, but if the fianc\u00e9 can't respect her professional decisions and the need for a safe work environment, it might indicate a deeper problem. However, the author could have considered whether the fianc\u00e9's concerns had merit. The 6-year-olds and 17-year-olds are different, so the comparison isn't valid. The 17-year-old's actions were intentional, unlike the younger kids. \n\nBut is the author wrong for leaving? The fianc\u00e9 didn't support her, which caused emotional distress. If the relationship can't handle such issues, maybe ending it is necessary. However, maybe she could have addressed the fianc\u00e9's concerns more, but since he wasn't listening, her decision might be justified. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for taking action against the student. Her reaction to the fianc\u00e9's lack of support is a personal choice. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
