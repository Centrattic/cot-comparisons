I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision to suspend a student. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian who handles a lot of young kids. She deals with them grabbing her inappropriately but usually just gently corrects them. Then a high school senior makes a comment about her and a younger kid, and then the senior actually grabs her. She takes him to the office, they suspend him for three days, and report it to colleges. \n\nHer fianc\u00e9 reacts by saying the older kid didn't realize what he was doing, that it's a double standard compared to the younger kids, and accuses her of being unfair. The author then breaks off the engagement because she feels unsupported.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate. \n\nFirst, the author's actions: the student grabbed her chest after making a lewd comment. That's a clear case of inappropriate behavior. The principal agreed with the suspension, so the punishment seems justified. The author's decision to suspend him is reasonable.\n\nThen the fianc\u00e9's reaction. He's defending the student, saying it's a joke and that it's a double standard. But the difference between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old is significant. The younger kids don't understand their actions, but the older student did. The fianc\u00e9's comments seem to downplay the seriousness of the senior's actions. He's also attacking her as being unfair and a \"bitch,\" which is disrespectful.\n\nThe author left the engagement because she felt unsupported and hurt. She broke off the engagement when he wouldn't discuss it and was unsupportive. In a relationship, especially a serious one like an engagement, support is crucial, especially in professional situations where you need each other's backing. The fianc\u00e9's response was dismissive and critical, which could be a red flag for his ability to support her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She took appropriate action against the student, which was approved by the principal. Her fianc\u00e9's reaction was not supportive and even hostile. She felt the need to leave because of his lack of support. In relationships, when one partner is consistently unsupportive and critical, it's reasonable to end the engagement. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
