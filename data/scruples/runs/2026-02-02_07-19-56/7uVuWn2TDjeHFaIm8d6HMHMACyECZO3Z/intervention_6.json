I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement due to her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian at a preK-12 school. She deals with young kids who sometimes touch her inappropriately, which she handles by gently correcting them. Then, a high school student makes a comment about a younger child touching her, and then the high schooler himself grabs her. She takes him to the office, and the principal gives him a 3-day suspension and a call home. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about this, saying it's a double standard compared to how she handles younger kids and that the punishment is too harsh. The author feels he's not supporting her and ends the engagement.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the appropriateness of the punishment and the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The author argues that a 17-year-old knows better and the action was serious, while the younger kids are not aware. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's a joke and that the punishment is too severe. The author felt unsupported and left the engagement.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate. \n\nFirst, the author's actions: She dealt with inappropriate behavior by a student. The high schooler grabbed her breast, which is a clear case of assault. The school's response (suspension) seems reasonable for a high schooler. The author acted professionally and followed the school's disciplinary procedures. Her decision to involve the principal and take appropriate action is justified.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction: He's dismissing the seriousness of the older student's actions, comparing them to the younger kids who aren't aware of their actions. This is a problem because a 17-year-old is an adult in terms of age and should understand the wrongness of their actions. The fianc\u00e9 is suggesting that the punishment is unfair, which could imply that the author is being biased. His comments about the punishment being a permanent mark on the student's record (colleges) also seem to minimize the incident's seriousness. \n\nThe author felt that her fianc\u00e9 wasn't standing by her, which is important in a relationship, especially when dealing with such a stressful situation. Breaking off the engagement because of a lack of support and differing values might be reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's friends also came after her, which adds to the conflict.\n\nSo, the author's decision to end the engagement is based on the fianc\u00e9's failure to support her and his judgment of her professional actions. The fianc\u00e9's stance could be seen as minimizing a serious issue (sexual assault by a high schooler) and not respecting her boundaries. The author's reaction is about feeling unsupported and possibly dealing with a partner who doesn't take her safety and professional decisions seriously.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The author did nothing wrong in handling the incident. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for breaking up the engagement over this. However, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9's criticism was about her professional judgment, which is a valid area of conflict. But given the context, the fianc\u00e9's lack of support and minimizing a serious incident is more of an issue.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
