I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her handling of a student suspension.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a librarian at a prek-12 school. A young child accidentally touches her, and a high schooler mocks her, then grabs her chest. She reports the high schooler, leading to a 3-day suspension and a call home. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't support her, saying the punishment is too harsh and that it's a double standard since younger kids also touch her but aren't punished. The author breaks up with him because she feels unsupported and he's defending the student's actions.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\n1. **The Incident Handling**: The author's response to the high schooler grabbing her chest seems appropriate. The student's action was intentional and inappropriate, unlike the younger kids who are unaware. The punishment (suspension, call home) seems reasonable given the intentional nature of the act and the context (public school environment). The principal agreed, so the author's actions were in line with school protocols.\n\n2. **Fianc\u00e9's Reaction**: The fianc\u00e9's issue is not with the action itself but with the consequences (suspension affecting college records). He argues it's a double standard, but the key difference is intent and age. The 17-year-old understood his actions, unlike the 6-year-olds. The fianc\u00e9 seems to downplay the seriousness, suggesting the author is being unfair, which is concerning. His comments about her being an \"unfair teacher\" and telling her to \"take a joke\" are dismissive of her professional judgment and the severity of the incident.\n\n3. **Relationship Dynamics**: The author felt unsupported and hurt. The fianc\u00e9's lack of empathy and refusal to acknowledge her valid concerns about safety and professionalism in her job are significant. Relationships require mutual support, especially in high-stress situations. His friends even criticized her as unfair, adding external pressure.\n\n4. **Ethical and Professional Considerations**: The author acted within her duty to maintain a safe environment. The fianc\u00e9's criticism undermines her professional role. Supporting a partner through such situations is crucial; his response was not supportive and indicated a lack of respect for her career and decisions.\n\n5. **Decision to Break Off Engagement**: The author left because she felt unsupported and her feelings were invalidated. The fianc\u00e9's stance seemed to prioritize the student's future over her well-being and professional judgment. The author's decision to end the engagement is a personal choice, but given the fianc\u00e9's lack of empathy and support, it's understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the fianc\u00e9's behavior was problematic, and the author's response to seek a supportive relationship is justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
