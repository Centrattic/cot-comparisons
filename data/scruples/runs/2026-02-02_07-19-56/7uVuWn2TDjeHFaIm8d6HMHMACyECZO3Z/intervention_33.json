I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about breaking off the engagement with the fianc\u00e9 because of his reaction to her suspending a student. The main issue here is whether the author made the right decision, and if her fianc\u00e9's reaction was justified.\n\nFirst, the incident itself. A student, 17 years old, grabs the author's chest after making a joke about a younger kid's accidental touch. The author takes action, leading to a three-day suspension. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because he thinks it's unfair compared to how younger kids are handled. He also accuses her of being biased because she was involved in the punishment decision. The author then breaks up the engagement because of his lack of support and his stance on the matter.\n\nNow, let's break this down. The author's actions: she's a librarian in a prek-12 school. When a 6-year-old accidentally touches her, she handles it gently. But when a 17-year-old deliberately grabs her chest, she takes strict action. The principal agrees with the suspension, which is reported to colleges. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because he thinks the punishment is too harsh and that the author is biased. He also tells her to laugh it off, which she finds hurtful.\n\nFrom a legal and professional standpoint, the 17-year-old's action was intentional. The 6-year-olds are young, and their actions are accidental. The difference in age and intent is significant. The principal supported the suspension, so the author's actions seem appropriate. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's a double standard is weak because the situations aren't the same. The author didn't punish the younger kids because they don't understand their actions, but the older student does. The suspension being reported to colleges is standard for disciplinary actions in schools, especially for high school students.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is the problem here. He's dismissing her experience and the seriousness of the incident. Telling her to \"take a joke\" and call her a \"bitch\" is not supportive. The author felt unsupported, which led her to end the engagement. In a relationship, especially when one partner's job is involved, support is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 didn't validate her experience and instead criticized her judgment. That's a red flag in a relationship.\n\nSo, the author's decision to break up the engagement is more about the fianc\u00e9's lack of support and judgmental attitude rather than her actions in the incident. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the fianc\u00e9's response is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
