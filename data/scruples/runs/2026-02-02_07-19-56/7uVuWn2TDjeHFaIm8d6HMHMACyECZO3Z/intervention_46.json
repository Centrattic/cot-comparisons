I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, a librarian, dealing with a student harassment incident and then breaking up with their fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to how she handled the suspension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The librarian is handling a situation where a 6-year-old accidentally touches her, which she's used to. Then a 17-year-old mocks her and then grabs her. She suspends him, and the principal agrees with the 3-day suspension. The fianc\u00e9 is upset that the student's record gets affected, calling it a joke and saying it's unfair. The author breaks up because of his lack of support, and now people are saying she's being unfair.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: She's a professional dealing with harassment. The 17-year-old intentionally grabbed her, which is a serious violation. She took appropriate action, the principal supported it. The fianc\u00e9 is dismissing the severity, equating the 17-year-old's intentional act with the young child's accidental behavior. He's defending the student's actions as a joke and not supporting her. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement. That seems justified if the fianc\u00e9 is invalidating her experience and not standing by her in a serious situation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about the student's future. However, the student was 17, an adult in terms of legal responsibility, and the act was intentional. The suspension being reported to colleges is a consequence of the school's policy, not the author's personal vendetta. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's a double standard ignores the difference in intent and age. The author is in a position where she needs to maintain professional boundaries and ensure safety, especially after the initial incident with the younger kids.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction could be seen as minimizing the harassment and not respecting her professional judgment. If a partner can't support you in a work-related issue that affects your safety and professional standing, that's a red flag. The author's decision to leave might be justified because the relationship lacked support during a critical time.\n\nSo, the fianc\u00e9 is in the wrong for not acknowledging the seriousness of the situation and dismissing her actions. The author is not the asshole here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
