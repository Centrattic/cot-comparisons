I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a librarian who got a high school student suspended after the student grabbed her chest, and her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The librarian handles younger kids who accidentally touch her, which she addresses gently. Then a high school student sees this and makes a comment, then grabs her. She takes him to the office, and they suspend him for 3 days. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinks it's a double standard because the younger kids aren't punished similarly. The author feels unsupported and breaks off the engagement.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: She's a teacher trying to create a safe environment. The high schooler's actions were intentional and inappropriate. She took appropriate disciplinary action, which the principal agreed with. Her fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to downplay the seriousness of the high schooler's actions, comparing them to the younger kids' accidental touches. The author's decision to end the engagement because of the lack of support is her choice, but the question is whether she was wrong in doing so.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that the punishment is too harsh and a double standard. However, the context is different: a 17-year-old grabbing someone is a deliberate, inappropriate act, while younger kids are just unaware. The author's actions seem appropriate given the situation. The fianc\u00e9's inability to see the difference might indicate a problem in their relationship, especially if he's not supportive of her professional decisions.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's friends also call her unfair, but that might be because they side with the student. However, the author's actions were in line with school policy and the principal's decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong for taking action. Her decision to end the engagement is her right, especially if she felt unsupported and disrespected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
