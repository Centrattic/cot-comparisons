I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 because of his reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's a librarian at a school. Kids, especially younger ones, sometimes touch her inappropriately. She handles it by gently correcting them. Then a 17-year-old sees a 6-year-old touch her and makes a comment. The older kid then grabs her, she takes him to the office, gets a suspension. Her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her, thought the punishment was too harsh, called her unfair, and she broke off the engagement.\n\nSo, the question is whether her leaving him was wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nShe felt unsupported and hurt. Her fianc\u00e9 didn't validate her experience. He saw the older kid as just a teenager who didn't know better, even after he made a comment and then grabbed her. The key difference between the 6-year-old and the 17-year-old is age and intent. The older kid was clearly aware of his actions, making it deliberate. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he downplayed the seriousness of the older student's actions, which could be seen as not taking the harassment seriously. That's a big deal, especially if it affects her safety and job satisfaction. Her decision to leave because she felt unsupported might be justified if their core values are incompatible, like how they handle harassment and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 thought the punishment was too severe. But a 3-day suspension for assault, especially since it's a school setting and it needs to be reported to colleges, might be standard. If he's arguing against her professional judgment, that could be a problem in their relationship. \n\nThe author's actions in reporting the incident were appropriate. The fianc\u00e9's support (or lack thereof) is crucial here. If someone doesn't support their partner's professional conduct in a case of harassment, that's a red flag. So the author's decision to end the engagement because of this might not be in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
