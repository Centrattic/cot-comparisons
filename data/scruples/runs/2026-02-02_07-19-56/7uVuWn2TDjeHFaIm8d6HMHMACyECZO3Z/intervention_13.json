I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement over her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian who deals with young kids who sometimes touch her inappropriately, but she handles it gently. Then a high school student makes a comment about her and a younger kid, leading to the student grabbing her. She suspends him, and the principal agrees with the punishment. Her fianc\u00e9, however, defends the high school student, saying it's a double standard compared to the younger kids. He accuses her of being unfair and targeting the student because she had a say in the punishment. She feels unsupported, breaks off the engagement, and now is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author took disciplinary action, which she and the principal deemed appropriate. The fianc\u00e9 is not supporting her decision, instead defending the student and criticizing her for being unfair. The author felt this disagreement was a dealbreaker.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether her fianc\u00e9's reaction was inappropriate and if her decision to end the engagement was justified. \n\nThe author's actions as a teacher: she handled the younger kids' behavior appropriately, but the high school student escalated the situation by grabbing her. She took him to the office, and the principal agreed on a 3-day suspension. That seems reasonable. The student was an adult, 17 years old, and intentionally grabbed her, which is different from the younger kids who don't understand. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's a double standard is flawed because the contexts are different. The fianc\u00e9's support (or lack thereof) was a significant issue for the author, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction: he's dismissing her professional judgment, accusing her of being unfair, and not supporting her during a stressful time. This could be a red flag for the author in terms of compatibility, especially if they can't have discussions about important issues without conflict. The author felt hurt and unsupported, which is valid. Ending the engagement over this disagreement shows that the fianc\u00e9's lack of support was a dealbreaker for her. \n\nIs the author wrong for leaving? Well, she had the right to feel unsupported and make a choice based on her own values and needs. If the fianc\u00e9 couldn't respect her professional decisions and the context of the situation, that's a problem in the relationship. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that breaking off an engagement over this is extreme, but given the circumstances, it's her right to prioritize her values and emotional well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
