I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a librarian who suspended a high school student after he grabbed her chest. The fianc\u00e9 disapproved of the suspension and the author broke up with him. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The librarian, the author, was handling a situation where a young child accidentally touched her, and a high schooler made a comment about it. Then the high schooler grabbed her, which led to suspension. The author's fianc\u00e9 criticized her decision, leading to the breakup.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments. The author acted in response to a clear violation. The high schooler intentionally grabbed her, which is different from the younger children's accidental touches. The principal agreed with the suspension. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to downplay the seriousness of the older student's intentional action, comparing it to the younger kids' actions, which are accidental and not malicious.\n\nThe author's actions were to protect herself and set a boundary, which is reasonable. The suspension was appropriate given the student's intent. The fianc\u00e9's support (or lack thereof) was based on a flawed understanding of the situation, possibly minimizing the harassment. The author's decision to end the engagement because of the lack of support might be justified if the fianc\u00e9 couldn't respect her professional and personal boundaries.\n\nBut wait, is the author wrong in how she handled the suspension? The principal supported the action, so procedurally it's correct. The fianc\u00e9's criticism is about the punitive measure, but the author had to consider college reports. The author's perspective is that the student understood the wrongness (from his reaction) and thus deserved consequences. The fianc\u00e9's stance seems to be that it's a joke, which is concerning because it trivializes harassment.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for taking action against the student. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for breaking up over his unsupportive and dismissive behavior.\n"
