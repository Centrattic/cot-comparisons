I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a librarian who had to deal with a student grabbing her in front of others. She suspended the student, and her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author took action because a 17-year-old grabbed her after a 6-year-old's accidental touch. The principal supported the 3-day suspension, so the punishment was in line with school policy. The fianc\u00e9 argued that it's a double standard because the younger kids aren't punished the same way. But the key difference is that the 17-year-old had intent and was in a high school setting, which is more serious. The author handled the situation professionally, reported it, and followed procedures.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be dismissing her experience and the incident, which is a problem. He's not supporting her, which is part of why the relationship ended. The author left because she felt unsupported. The fianc\u00e9's friends are also blaming her for being unfair, but their stance is likely based on his perspective.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she took appropriate action as per her job. The suspension was decided with the principal, so she's not overstepping. The fianc\u00e9's issues are more about his lack of support and understanding of the gravity of the situation. The author had the right to feel hurt and leave the engagement because of his lack of support. So the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
