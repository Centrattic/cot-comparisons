I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by reading through the scenario carefully. The user is a librarian at a preK-12 school who had to deal with a 6-year-old grabbing her and then a 17-year-old grabbing her in the library. The principal suspended the 17-year-old for three days, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset about the suspension being reported to colleges. The user ended the engagement because the fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision, leading to the question if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user has a job in a school, which requires handling inappropriate behavior from students. The 6-year-old's actions are typical for that age, and handling them gently makes sense. The 17-year-old, however, is an older student. When he saw the 6-year-old's action and made a comment, then grabbed the user's chest, that's a clear violation. The principal agreed and gave a suspension, which is within standard disciplinary procedures for such incidents.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is the main issue here. He downplays the 17-year-old's actions, comparing him to the younger kids, which isn't a valid comparison. The 17-year-old was aware of his actions and the context, making his behavior inappropriate and intentional. The suspension being reported to colleges is standard for disciplinary actions in high school. The fianc\u00e9's criticism of the user's professionalism and fairness is unfounded, especially since the principal supported the decision. \n\nThe user felt unsupported and broke off the engagement, which is a personal decision based on differing values and priorities. The fianc\u00e9's friends blaming her for being unfair doesn't change the fact that the user did her job correctly. The key point is whether the user acted wrongly in leaving the engagement. Since the fianc\u00e9 didn't support her professional judgment and instead criticized her, the user's decision to end the relationship isn't in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
