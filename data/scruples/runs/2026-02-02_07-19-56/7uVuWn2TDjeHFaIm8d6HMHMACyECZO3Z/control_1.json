I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a librarian at a preK-12 school. She deals with younger kids who accidentally touch her chest, which she handles by gently moving their hands or telling them to watch their hands. That seems reasonable, given the age of the children. Then, a high school senior sees a young child grabbing her and makes a comment, which escalates when the student then grabs her. She reports him, and he gets suspended for three days. The principal agrees with the punishment. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's issue is with the suspension affecting the student's college record. He argues that it's a double standard since the younger kids aren't punished the same way. He also accuses the author of being unfair and targeting the student because she influenced the punishment. He tells her to \"take a joke\" and not be a \"bitch,\" which leads her to break up with him. His friends are now accusing her of being unfair and rash.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The high schooler's action was intentional. He grabbed her after making a comment, which shows intent. The principal supported the suspension, indicating it was appropriate. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to minimize the severity of the high schooler's actions. The age difference between the younger kids and the high schooler is significant. The younger ones don't understand, but the older student should know better. The fianc\u00e9's stance that it's a joke and that the punishment is too harsh might indicate a lack of support for the author's need for a safe work environment. \n\nHer decision to end the engagement because she felt unsupported makes sense. The fianc\u00e9's argument about double standards ignores the context of intent and age. The author acted within her role to address harassment, which is appropriate. The fianc\u00e9's friends' criticism doesn't change the fact that he didn't support her. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Her actions were justified, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction was problematic.\n"
