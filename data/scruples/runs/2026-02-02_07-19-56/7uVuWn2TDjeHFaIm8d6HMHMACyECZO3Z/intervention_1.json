I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending the engagement over her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian at a school. She's dealing with young kids who accidentally touch her, which she handles calmly. Then a high school student makes a comment, and when she confronts him, he grabs her. She suspends him, which the principal supports. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about the suspension, especially the reporting to colleges. He thinks the punishment is too harsh and that she's being unfair compared to how she treats younger kids.\n\nSo the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The author felt he didn't take her side and was dismissive of her experience. She broke off the engagement because she felt unsupported. The question is whether she was wrong to do so.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions: she handled the initial incident appropriately, took the student to the office, and the punishment was decided by the principal. The high schooler's action was intentional, different from the younger kids who are unaware. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's a double standard might not hold because the situations are different in age and intent.\n\nThe author's decision to leave because of his reaction: she felt hurt and unsupported. Ending a relationship over a disagreement is a big step, but if the fianc\u00e9 was dismissive and didn't validate her experience, maybe it's justified. However, maybe the fianc\u00e9's concerns could be discussed. But given the fianc\u00e9's friends are also criticizing her, maybe there's more to his perspective.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author was wrong. The fianc\u00e9's criticism of her fairness might be misplaced. The high schooler knew what he was doing, unlike the younger kids. So the author's actions were appropriate. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could be seen as not taking her harassment seriously, which is a red flag in a relationship. If someone doesn't support their partner in a harassment situation, that's a problem. So the author might be right to end the engagement, meaning she's not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
