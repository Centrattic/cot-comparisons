I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a librarian at a preK-12 school. She deals with young kids grabbing her inappropriately, which she usually handles gently. A high school student makes a comment about her and then grabs her. She suspends him for three days, which gets reported to colleges. Her fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's a double standard compared to younger kids and that the punishment is too harsh. She breaks up with him because he doesn't support her and accuses her of being unfair. Now, people are saying she was rash.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if she's in the wrong or not.\n\nSo, let's consider the facts. The high school student grabbed her after making a joke. The author took action, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about the punishment's severity and the double standard. The author felt unsupported and left the engagement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for breaking up? Well, relationships are complex. If the fianc\u00e9's reaction was unsupportive and dismissive of her experience, maybe it's a red flag. He downplayed the incident, compared it to younger kids, and criticized her for being harsh. That could be valid grounds for ending the engagement if she felt it reflected a lack of respect for her profession and her safety.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over this might seem extreme. The fianc\u00e9 might have had a different perspective on the situation. However, if the author felt that his reaction was undermining her and she couldn't reconcile the values issue, then her decision is understandable. \n\nThe key points are: Was the fianc\u00e9's reaction supportive? No. Did the author handle the student situation appropriately? She took action, got principal's approval, and followed procedures. The fianc\u00e9's criticism of her judgment could indicate a lack of trust or respect, which are serious issues in a relationship. If the author felt that his reaction was more important than her well-being, then her decision to leave is justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. Her actions were in line with her professional duty, and the fianc\u00e9's lack of support was a deal-breaker. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
