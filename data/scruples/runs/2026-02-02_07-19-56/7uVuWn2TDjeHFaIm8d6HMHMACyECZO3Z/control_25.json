I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement over her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a librarian in a preK-12 school. She's dealing with younger kids grabbing her due to their size, which she handles gently. A high school student mocks her for this, then grabs her. She takes the student to the office, and they decide on a 3-day suspension. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, saying the high schooler was just a kid like the younger ones and the punishment was too harsh. He accuses her of being unfair and targeting the student. The author feels unsupported and breaks the engagement.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the severity of the actions and the appropriate response. The younger kids are not aware of their actions, but the high schooler was clearly intentional. The author took action, and the school administration agreed with the suspension. The fianc\u00e9 is dismissing her actions as unfair, comparing the two different scenarios. \n\nThe author's argument is that there's a significant difference between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old. The high schooler's actions were deliberate and inappropriate, while the younger kids are just being kids. The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he doesn't see that distinction. The suspension is also reported to colleges, which the fianc\u00e9 objects to, but the author believes the student should be held accountable.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting someone's decision to take a stand against harassment is important. The author was in a situation where she was being harassed, and she took appropriate disciplinary action. Her fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to downplay the seriousness of the high schooler's actions and accuse her of being unfair, which could indicate a lack of support and empathy. \n\nBreaking off an engagement over this might be extreme, but if the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to acknowledge her experience and support her decisions, it could be valid for her to end the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's friends also criticizing her adds to her feeling of being unsupported. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the fianc\u00e9's stance seems to be the issue here. He's not supporting her in a situation where she's standing up for herself against harassment. The author's actions are justified, and his reaction is dismissive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the engagement based on his lack of support.\n"
