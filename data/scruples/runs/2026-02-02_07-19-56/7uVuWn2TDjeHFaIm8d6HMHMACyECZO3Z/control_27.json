I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking off their engagement. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a librarian at a preK-12 school. She deals with young kids grabbing her breasts because they're at eye level and the kids don't realize it. She usually handles it gently. Then a high school senior makes a comment, and when she confronts the kid, he grabs her. She takes him to the office, the principal suspends him for three days, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset about the suspension being on the kid's record. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that it's a double standard since the younger kids aren't punished the same way. The author thinks there's a big difference between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old. The fianc\u00e9 accuses her of being unfair and targeting the student because she was involved in the punishment. The author feels unsupported and leaves the engagement. Now, the question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the actions of the high school student. The kid saw the younger child's accidental touch, made a sarcastic comment, then when confronted, he intentionally grabbed her. That's a deliberate action, unlike the younger kids who don't understand. The age difference is significant here. At 17, he's expected to know better. The suspension is three days and reported to colleges. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's too harsh, comparing it to the younger kids. But the younger kids aren't aware, while the high schooler was being intentional and provocative.\n\nThe author's actions in reporting the incident and working with the principal seem appropriate. The principal agreed the punishment was appropriate. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is the issue here. He's defending the high schooler, downplaying the intentional act, and criticizing the author's judgment. He also accused her of being unfair, which could be about her taking the incident seriously. The author felt unsupported and decided to end the engagement because of this conflict.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author handled the incident in a professional manner. The fianc\u00e9's response was problematic, as he was defending the student's actions and undermining her. The author's decision to leave might be justified because she felt unsupported and the fianc\u00e9's stance was in conflict with her values and professional judgment. The fianc\u00e9's friends criticizing her as unfair adds to the issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the fianc\u00e9's reaction was the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
