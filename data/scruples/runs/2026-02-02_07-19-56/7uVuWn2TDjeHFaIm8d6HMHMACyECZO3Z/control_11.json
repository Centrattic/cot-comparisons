I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 because of his reaction to her getting a student suspended.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's a librarian at a school. A young student inadvertently touches her, which she's used to, but a high schooler sees it and makes a comment. Then that high schooler grabs her, which is intentional. She suspends him, and the principal agrees with the three-day suspension. The fianc\u00e9, however, is upset. He thinks the high schooler didn't realize his mistake, compares it to the younger kids, and criticizes the punishment (college report, etc.). He says she's unfair and not impartial, and even tells her to take a joke and stop being a \"bitch.\" She breaks it off because she feels unsupported and hurt.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are: \n\n1. The high schooler's actions were intentional after seeing the younger kid's incident. He grabbed her boob intentionally, which is a serious violation. The younger kids are not aware, but a 17-year-old should know better. The suspension and reporting to colleges is appropriate here. The fianc\u00e9 minimizing the high schooler's actions and comparing him to the younger kids shows a lack of support for her and possibly invalidating her experience.\n\n2. The fianc\u00e9's reaction: He's defending the high schooler, accusing her of being unfair, and even making derogatory comments. That's a red flag in a relationship, especially when he's not standing by her during a stressful situation. His friends also side with him, which adds to the problem.\n\n3. The breakup: She left because she felt unsupported and hurt. Ending the engagement over such a serious issue where her feelings and job are on the line is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's stance shows a lack of empathy and understanding, which is a valid reason to end a relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were justified. She took appropriate action against the student, which was supported by the principal. The fianc\u00e9's response was unsupportive and critical, leading her to end the engagement. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she is not in the wrong.\n"
