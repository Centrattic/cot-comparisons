I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her getting a student suspended.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian who had an incident where a 6-year-old grabbed her chest accidentally, which she handles normally. Then a 17-year-old mocks her, grabs her, and she suspends him. The principal agrees with the suspension. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because he thinks it's unfair to punish the older kid when younger kids do similar things, and he accuses her of targeting the student because she was involved in the punishment. The author feels unsupported and breaks off the engagement. The fianc\u00e9's friends are also critical of her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if AITA (Am I the Asshole) applies here. \n\nThe key points here are the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The author's actions as a professional: handling the 6-year-old's accidental grab appropriately, and then dealing with the 17-year-old who made a deliberate, lewd act. The fianc\u00e9 is dismissing the severity of the older student's intentional action compared to the younger children's accidental ones. The author is justified in punishing the older student because he knew what he was doing and acted inappropriately. The fianc\u00e9's criticism implies that her reaction was unfair or excessive, which could undermine her professional judgment. \n\nLeaving a fianc\u00e9 over such a disagreement might seem extreme, but if the relationship can't handle differing values\u2014like respecting professional boundaries and addressing harassment\u2014it might be a valid reason. The fianc\u00e9's support (or lack thereof) is crucial in a relationship. If he can't back her in a situation where she's doing her job correctly, that's a red flag. \n\nThe author's decision to end the engagement because she felt unsupported and the fianc\u00e9 accused her of being unfair could be seen as justified. The fianc\u00e9's friends adding pressure by calling her unfair and rash also shows a lack of support. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whose behavior was in the wrong. The author's actions as a professional were appropriate. The fianc\u00e9's criticism and lack of support are the issues here. So the author isn't in the wrong for leaving. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
