I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a librarian getting a student suspended after he grabbed her chest, and her fianc\u00e9 disapproving of the punishment, leading her to end the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The librarian is dealing with younger kids who sometimes touch her inappropriately, but she handles it gently. Then a high school student makes a comment and later grabs her, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9 argues it's a double standard and the punishment is too harsh, so she breaks up with him. Now, the question is if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Was the suspension justified? 2) Is the author in the wrong for ending the engagement because of this disagreement?\n\nStarting with the suspension. The high school student made a comment and then physically grabbed her. The librarian took him to the principal, and a 3-day suspension was given. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it's a double standard because younger kids aren't punished the same way. But the key difference here is the age and intent. The 6-year-olds are not aware, but the 17-year-old was clearly aware and made a joke, then escalated it by grabbing. The suspension being reported to colleges might be a point of contention, but the main issue is the act itself. The librarian handled it according to school procedures, so the suspension seems justified.\n\nThen, the fianc\u00e9's reaction. He's defending the student, saying it's a joke, and is critical of her actions. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement. The fianc\u00e9's stance seems to be in conflict with her professional handling of the situation. Breaking up over this might be a heavy decision, but if the fianc\u00e9 is not supportive and his views are problematic (e.g., minimizing harassment), it's a valid reason. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the suspension was appropriate, then she's not wrong in taking action. Ending the engagement over such a significant disagreement is her choice. The fianc\u00e9's friends blaming her as unfair might be their bias, but the facts seem on her side. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
