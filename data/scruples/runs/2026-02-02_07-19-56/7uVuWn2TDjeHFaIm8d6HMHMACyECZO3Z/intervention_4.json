I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement after a disagreement with her fianc\u00e9 about a student's behavior and the subsequent punishment.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, a school librarian, handles a situation where a student grabs her inappropriately. She suspends the student, but her fianc\u00e9 criticizes her actions, saying the punishment was too harsh and that the student didn't realize what he was doing. The fianc\u00e9 accuses her of being unfair and not impartial. This leads to the author ending the engagement because she felt unsupported.\n\nNow, evaluating responsibility. The key here is whether the author was justified in her actions and if the fianc\u00e9's reaction was reasonable. The author took appropriate steps to address the harassment, leading to a 3-day suspension. The fianc\u00e9's criticism isn't about the incident itself but the punishment's severity. He also suggests she was unfair, which undermines her professional judgment. The author likely felt that her fianc\u00e9 was invalidating her experience and the seriousness of the harassment. \n\nBreaking up over differing opinions can be complex, but if the fianc\u00e9 was dismissive of her safety and professionalism, that's a red flag. The author might have felt that the relationship lacked support for her career and well-being. While the decision to end the engagement is personal, it's based on feeling unsupported in a critical situation. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether her fianc\u00e9's reaction was unreasonable. Given that the harassment was clear and the punishment aligned with school policies, the fianc\u00e9's stance seems to trivialize the incident. Therefore, the author's decision might be justified. But the answer could swing either way based on perspective. However, since the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, I need to consider if the fianc\u00e9's concerns were valid. However, given the context, the fianc\u00e9's criticism seems to downplay the seriousness of the harassment, which is concerning. So, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
