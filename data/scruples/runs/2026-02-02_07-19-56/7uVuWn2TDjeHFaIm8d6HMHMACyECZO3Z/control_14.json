I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for leaving their fianc\u00e9 because of his reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, the context: The woman is a librarian at a preK-12 school. She deals with younger kids grabbing her inappropriately, which she handles gently because they're young. Then a high schooler yells a comment about her, grabs her, and she suspends him. The principal agrees with the suspension. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is the issue. He thinks the high schooler was just a kid and that there's a double standard compared to the younger kids. He accuses her of being unfair and targeting the student because she was involved in the punishment. He also says the suspension being on the student's record is too harsh for a \"joke.\" The woman felt unsupported and broke off the engagement. Now his friends are saying she was unfair.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for leaving. \n\nFirst, the woman's actions: She dealt with a 6-year-old's accidental touch, which she's used to. The high schooler's comment and grab were intentional and inappropriate. She took action, got the principal involved, and the punishment was 3 days suspension and a call home. The principal agreed. So her actions seem appropriate given the deliberate nature of the high schooler's actions versus the younger kids' accidental touches.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction: He downplays the severity of the incident. He's defending the older student's behavior as a joke, not recognizing the intentional harassment. He accuses her of being unfair, implying she's biased against the student. This shows a lack of support and possibly not understanding the seriousness of the situation. His friends also side with him, suggesting their views are more aligned. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the woman made a professional decision based on the student's actions. The fianc\u00e9's response was dismissive and unsupportive. She felt hurt and unsupported, leading her to end the engagement. Her decision to leave is based on his inability to respect her professional judgment and support her during a stressful situation. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's stance seems to ignore the context of the incident. There's a clear difference between a 6-year-old's accidental touch and a 17-year-old's intentional, disrespectful act. The punishment was appropriate given the age and intent. The fianc\u00e9's criticism undermines her work and her safety. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction was invalid and unsupportive, so leaving the engagement is justified.\n"
