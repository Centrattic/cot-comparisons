I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a librarian who got engaged to someone, but then broke off the engagement because her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision to suspend a student.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The librarian is dealing with a 6-year-old who accidentally touches her, which she handles gently. Then a 17-year-old high school student mocks her and grabs her, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9 is upset that the suspension was reported to colleges and that the punishment was too harsh, comparing it to the younger kids. The author thinks there's a difference between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old's understanding of appropriateness.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 over this. Let's consider the key points. The librarian's actions: she handled the 6-year-old with understanding, but the 17-year-old's actions were intentional and mocking. She took appropriate disciplinary action as per the principal. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is that she's unfair, targeting the student because she influenced the punishment, and that the suspension is too harsh. The author felt unsupported, leading her to break the engagement.\n\nLegally and ethically, the 17-year-old's actions are intentional and more serious. Schools often have different standards based on age. The fianc\u00e9's response might be seen as not respecting her professional judgment and the seriousness of the situation. The author's decision to end the engagement is based on a fundamental disagreement about values\u2014respect for boundaries and appropriate consequences. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. She acted within her role, the punishment was appropriate for the student's age and intent, and the fianc\u00e9's lack of support on a significant issue could be a valid reason to end the engagement. So, the answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
