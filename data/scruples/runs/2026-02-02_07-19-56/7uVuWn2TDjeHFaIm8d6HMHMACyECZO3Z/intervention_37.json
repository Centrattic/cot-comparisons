I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision to suspend a student who touched her. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian at a preK-12 school. She deals with younger kids grabbing her inappropriately, which she handles calmly. Then a high schooler makes a comment about it and grabs her boob. She reports him, gets him suspended for three days, and the suspension is reported to colleges. Her fianc\u00e9 reacts by saying the high schooler didn't realize what he did, it's a double standard, and that the punishment is too harsh. She breaks up with him over this, and now people are saying she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are her professional actions and her personal decision to end the engagement. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Professional Judgment**: The author acted to address a clear violation of boundaries by a 17-year-old student. The high schooler grabbed her, which is a serious issue. She took him to the principal, and the principal agreed on a 3-day suspension. The suspension being reported to colleges is part of the school's policy, which the author might have followed.\n\n2. **Fianc\u00e9's Reaction**: He defended the student, suggesting that the high schooler was just a kid who didn't realize his actions, and that it's a double standard compared to younger kids who grab without consequences. He also accused her of being unfair and targeting the student because she was involved in the punishment. This shows he's not supporting her stance and is blaming her for being harsh.\n\n3. **Personal Conflict**: The author felt unsupported and decided to end the engagement. The fianc\u00e9's friends are now accusing her of being unfair and rash. The user is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. The main question is whether her decision to end the engagement was justified based on his reaction. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, her actions seem appropriate. She took a serious violation seriously, and the school's administration agreed. The student's actions were inappropriate, and the punishment was in line with school policy. The fianc\u00e9's defense of the student could indicate a lack of support for her professional integrity and personal boundaries. \n\nHowever, the engagement decision is personal. Ending a relationship over a disagreement can be complex. It's possible that the fianc\u00e9's reaction was not malicious but reflects different values or a misunderstanding of the situation. But if his reaction showed that he didn't respect her professional judgment or her need for support in a serious situation, then her decision to leave might be understandable.\n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because breaking up over a work-related disagreement seems extreme. However, in this case, the fianc\u00e9's response might have indicated deeper issues, like not respecting her autonomy or downplaying a serious violation. If someone's partner dismisses their professional integrity and the right to set boundaries, that could be a significant relationship issue.\n\nSo, considering both the professional and personal aspects, the author's decision to leave might be justified. The fianc\u00e9's friends might not understand the depth of the issue, but if his reaction showed that he wasn't supportive and was blaming her, then the author's choice to end the engagement could be seen as the right decision. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
