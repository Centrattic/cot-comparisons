I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is a librarian at a preK-12 school. She had an incident where a high school student grabbed her chest after a younger kid touched her. She took action, got the student suspended. Her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her, thought she was being unfair, and she broke up with him. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the suspension. The user says the high schooler grabbed her boob intentionally, unlike the younger kids who didn't understand. The principal agreed it was a 3-day suspension. The fianc\u00e9 argued that the punishment was too harsh and that it's a double standard because younger kids touch her without consequence.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, a 17-year-old should know better. His action was deliberate, not accidental. The user handled it by reporting and following procedures. The principal backed the suspension. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is questioning her judgment and implying the punishment is too harsh for a \"joke.\" \n\nThe user's decision to break up because of his lack of support is personal. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. She followed school protocols, the principal agreed, and the action was justified. Her fianc\u00e9's criticism of her fairness might be valid, but the situation's severity and the student's intent matter. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 might not understand the context of the difference between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old. The user's reaction was appropriate given the situation, but the fianc\u00e9's inability to support her could be a relationship issue rather than the user being in the wrong. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. The suspension was justified. The fianc\u00e9's stance is where the issue lies. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
