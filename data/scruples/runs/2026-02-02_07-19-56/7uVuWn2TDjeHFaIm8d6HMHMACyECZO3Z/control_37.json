I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for breaking off the engagement due to her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, the situation: The librarian had a student grab her chest. The older student did this after making a comment about the younger kids, then another older student grabbed her. She took action, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9 criticized her actions, saying it was unfair, comparing the older student to the younger kids, and told her to take a joke. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement.\n\nNow, analyzing the fianc\u00e9's stance: He dismissed the seriousness of the older student's actions. At 17, the student is old enough to understand boundaries and intent. The younger kids are pre-K, so their actions are accidental and not malicious. The fianc\u00e9's comparison is invalid because the contexts are different. His comments that she should \"take a joke\" and his accusation that she's unfair and targeting the student suggest he's not in touch with the reality of harassment. Supporting a harasser in this scenario shows a lack of respect and empathy for the victim.\n\nThe author's reaction: Ending the engagement because of his dismissive and unsupportive attitude is understandable. Feeling hurt and unsupported is valid, especially in a relationship where such serious issues arise. The fianc\u00e9's friends adding pressure by calling her unfair further indicates that he lacks support for her and the situation isn't being handled properly.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her fianc\u00e9's response was inappropriate and unsupportive. Breaking off the engagement over this shows she prioritizes her well-being and stands by her values. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
