I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement with their fianc\u00e9 after a disagreement about a student suspension.\n\nSo the situation is: The author is a librarian at a preK-12 school. A younger kid accidentally touches her, which she handles gently. Then a 17-year-old sees this, makes a comment, and then grabs her. The author suspends the high schooler for three days, which gets reported to colleges. The fianc\u00e9 reacts by saying the punishment was excessive and that the author was unfair, leading to the author ending the engagement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's actions: the high schooler made a sexual comment and then grabbed her. That's a serious boundary violation. As a teacher, she has a duty to handle such incidents, and suspending him seems appropriate given the age and intent. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is dismissing the seriousness, comparing him to the younger kids who act without understanding, which he shouldn't. That's a problem because a 17-year-old should know better.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective: He's arguing that the punishment is too harsh and that the author isn't fair because she didn't punish the younger kids. But the contexts are different. The high schooler's action was intentional and malicious, while the younger kids are acting out of innocence. The fianc\u00e9's support (or lack thereof) here is crucial. He's not standing with his partner in a professional and personal matter, which could be a red flag for the relationship.\n\nThe author felt unsupported and decided to end the engagement. The fianc\u00e9's friends are now criticizing her, but their issue is with the author's decision, not necessarily the validity of her actions. The key here is whether the author's decision to leave was justified based on the fianc\u00e9's reaction.\n\nThe author might be in the right because the fianc\u00e9's reaction is dismissive of a serious boundary violation. If a partner doesn't support you in a situation where you're doing your job correctly and facing harassment, that's a major issue. However, some might argue that the author overreacted by breaking up over this, but given the fianc\u00e9's lack of support and invalidation, it's a significant reason to end the relationship.\n\nSo, considering the fianc\u00e9's lack of support, invalidating her professional judgment and the seriousness of harassment, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the engagement. The answer should be B (No).\n"
