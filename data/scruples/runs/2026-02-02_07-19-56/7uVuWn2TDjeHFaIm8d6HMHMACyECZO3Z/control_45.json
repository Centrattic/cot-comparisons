I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement due to her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, a librarian, deals with young kids grabbing her inappropriately, which she handles gently because they're little. Then a high schooler makes a comment, and when she confronts him, he grabs her boob. She takes action, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's a double standard since younger kids also grab her, and that the punishment is too harsh. The author feels he's not supporting her and breaks up.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe key points here are about the appropriateness of the author's actions, the fianc\u00e9's reaction, and the decision to break up. \n\nThe author faced harassment from a student. Her handling of the situation seems professional: she addressed the immediate issue, took the student to the principal, and the decision to suspend was made jointly. The 3-day suspension and college notification are standard procedures. The fianc\u00e9 argues that it's a double standard because younger kids also touch her, but the age difference is significant. At 6, kids lack understanding, but 17-year-olds should know better. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of the severity of the high schooler's actions is questionable. He's defending the older student as just a joke, which is inappropriate. The author felt unsupported and decided to end the engagement because of his lack of empathy and support.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions: she took appropriate steps to address harassment. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems dismissive and invalidating. The author's decision to end the engagement is a personal choice based on feeling unsupported. Breaking up due to fundamental disagreements on such a serious issue is not inherently wrong. The fianc\u00e9's friends criticizing her as unfair might stem from his own perspective, but the author's actions were in line with professional standards.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her fianc\u00e9's reaction was supportive and understanding. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
