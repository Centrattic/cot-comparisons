I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a librarian who got her fianc\u00e9e suspended for grabbing her chest. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about the suspension being reported to colleges and thinks the punishment is too harsh. The author left him because of his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is dealing with a student who made a sexual comment and then physically grabbed her. The 17-year-old was in the library, saw the 6-year-old touching her, then made a joke. When confronted, he grabbed her boob. The author took him to the office, and the principal gave a 3-day suspension. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about that, saying it's a double standard because younger kids also touch her but aren't punished. \n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems to downplay the seriousness of the high schooler's actions. At 17, the student should know better. The younger kids might not understand their actions, but a 17-year-old committing a deliberate act of grabbing someone's chest is different. The fianc\u00e9e is defending the student and questioning the author's judgment as a teacher. That could be seen as invalidating her experience and not supporting her.\n\nThe author left the engagement because she felt unsupported. The fianc\u00e9e's friends are also criticizing her as unfair. But is the author in the wrong here? Well, she acted appropriately in reporting the incident. The suspension was decided by the principal, not just her. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems to be the problem\u2014he's not standing by her and is defending the student instead. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether breaking the engagement was justified. If the fianc\u00e9e can't support her in a serious situation like this, maybe ending the engagement was the right call.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. Could the author have overreacted? The suspension might be appropriate for a 17-year-old. The fianc\u00e9e's argument about double standards is weak because the contexts are different. The author handled the situation professionally. So the fianc\u00e9e's reaction is the issue here, not the author's actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
