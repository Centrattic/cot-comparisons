I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off her engagement over her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a librarian who deals with kids grabbing her inappropriately. The younger kids are just acting out of age-appropriate behavior, so she handles it gently. Then a high schooler makes a comment about it and later grabs her. She takes action, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't support her, saying the punishment is too harsh and that it's a double standard compared to the younger kids. The author feels unsupported and ends the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are about the severity of the actions. The 6-year-olds aren't aware of their actions, but the 17-year-old was clearly aware and intentional. The fianc\u00e9 argues it's a double standard, but the context is different. The author's response in reporting the incident and getting a suspension is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be minimizing the seriousness of the high schooler's action, which is a legal adult age, and the suspension being reported to colleges adds weight to the consequence. \n\nThe author felt that her fianc\u00e9 wasn't standing by her in a professional and personal matter. His friends also criticized her, which might indicate some social pressure. But is she wrong for ending the engagement? Relationships often break up over differing values or lack of support. If the fianc\u00e9 can't support her in a significant issue like this, it's a red flag. The author's decision to end things because she felt unsupported isn't necessarily wrong. The fianc\u00e9's stance seems to be downplaying the incident, which could be a problem.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. She had a valid reason to feel unsupported, and ending the engagement was a personal choice based on values alignment. So the answer should be B.\n"
