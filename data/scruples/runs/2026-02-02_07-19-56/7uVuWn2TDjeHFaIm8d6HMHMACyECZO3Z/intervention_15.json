I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a librarian at a preK-12 school, who suspended a high school student after he made a sexual comment and then grabbed her. The author's fianc\u00e9 is upset about the suspension and the impact on the student's college record, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author handled a 6-year-old's accidental touch by gently guiding them, which seems reasonable. However, the high schooler made a sarcastic comment and then physically grabbed her. The author took appropriate action by taking the student to the office, leading to a 3-day suspension and a call home. The principal agreed with the punishment, considering the student's age and intent.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is the issue here. He downplays the incident, suggesting it's a \"joke\" and that the punishment is too harsh. He accuses the author of being unfair, which causes the author to feel unsupported, leading to the engagement being broken. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving over this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's actions as a professional seem appropriate\u2014addressing harassment and following school protocol. The fianc\u00e9's inability to support her and his dismissal of the seriousness of the incident might indicate a lack of respect for her job and personal boundaries. Breaking up over such a disagreement could be justified if the fianc\u00e9's stance undermines the author's professional decisions and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9's concern is about the student's future being affected by the suspension, but the author's responsibility is to maintain a safe environment. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be inconsiderate of her professional and personal well-being. The author felt unsupported and hurt, which is a valid reason to end the relationship if there's a fundamental disagreement on such an important issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision to leave might be justified. The fianc\u00e9's lack of support and dismissive attitude could be the real issue here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
