I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is at fault for breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The librarian, who's also a fianc\u00e9e, was dealing with a 6-year-old grabbing her chest. She handles it by gently moving their hands. Then a 17-year-old sees this and makes a joke about it, leading him to grab her. She takes him to the office, and the principal gives a 3-day suspension. The fianc\u00e9 disapproves, saying the high schooler didn't know he was doing wrong, and it's a double standard compared to the younger kids. He accuses her of being unfair and targeting the student. She breaks up with him because he's unsupportive, and now his friends are criticizing her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the librarian's actions in handling the incident, the appropriateness of the punishment, and the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The main question is whether she's in the wrong for ending the engagement because of his response.\n\nFirst, the librarian's actions. The 17-year-old student grabbed her chest after making a joke about the younger child's actions. At 17, the student is an adult in terms of legal age and certainly should understand the implications of such behavior. The younger children aren't in the same category; they're too young to comprehend their actions in the same way. The 3-day suspension and reporting to colleges might be a heavy consequence, but given the inappropriate comment and the physical act, it's possible the school followed standard protocol. The librarian's decision to report and take action seems justified, considering the harassment and the public nature of the incident (friends were watching).\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9's reaction. He's defending the older student, calling it a double standard, and criticizing her teaching methods. He's even telling her to \"take a joke,\" which downplays the seriousness of the harassment. His friends are also chiming in, which suggests maybe he's not the only one who shares that view. However, as the fianc\u00e9, his support (or lack thereof) in a situation where his partner faced a harassment incident is a big deal. Supportive partners should stand by each other in such circumstances, especially when the partner is doing her job and facing backlash for it. His reaction seems dismissive and possibly enabling the student's behavior by not acknowledging the severity of the incident.\n\nThe decision to break up because of his response is significant. The user (the librarian) felt unsupported and hurt. If the fianc\u00e9 can't respect her professional decisions and her need for support in a sensitive situation, then the relationship might not be healthy. The fianc\u00e9's stance could indicate deeper issues, like not respecting her autonomy or failing to understand the seriousness of workplace harassment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the librarian's actions in the situation with the student seem appropriate, and the fianc\u00e9's response was unsupportive and dismissive. The user isn't in the wrong for leaving because she's justified in seeking a partner who supports her, especially in such a critical situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
