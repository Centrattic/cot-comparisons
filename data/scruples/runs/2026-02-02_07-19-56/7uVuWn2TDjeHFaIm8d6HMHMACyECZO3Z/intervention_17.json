I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a librarian who got a high school student suspended for grabbing their chest after the kid made a joke about it following a younger child's accidental touch. The fianc\u00e9 didn't support the decision, leading to the breakup. The question is if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points. The librarian handled a situation where a 6-year-old accidentally touched her, which is common in their role. Then a 17-year-old made a comment and later grabbed her. The principal supported the 3-day suspension, but the fianc\u00e9 thought it was unfair compared to the younger kids. The author is being called AITA for leaving the fianc\u00e9 over this.\n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The librarian's actions: dealing with the 17-year-old's intentional grab is different from the younger kids' accidental touches. The principal agreed with the punishment, so there's some authority backing. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is critical, saying it's a double standard. The author's decision to end the engagement because of the lack of support is the crux here.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9's disagreement with the punishment doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The situation involves a teacher's professional judgment. The high schooler's action was intentional, unlike the younger kids. The fianc\u00e9's stance might be dismissive of the severity of the older student's actions. However, the author's reaction to the fianc\u00e9's support (or lack thereof) leading to the breakup could be seen as overreacting if the fianc\u00e9 had a reasonable argument. But given that the principal agreed with the suspension, maybe the fianc\u00e9 was wrong in his assessment.\n\nThe author's job is to maintain a safe environment. The fianc\u00e9's comments about being a \"bitch\" and telling them to take a joke are problematic. The author felt unsupported and decided to end the engagement, which is a personal choice. Whether that's right depends on the relationship dynamics. However, the question is about the author's wrongness in the situation, not just the breakup.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that it's a double standard might miss the point. The younger kids can't be expected to understand, but a 17-year-old should. The suspension being reported to colleges is a consequence the principal deemed necessary. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could be seen as not respecting her professional decisions. The author might not be in the wrong for standing by her actions and the consequences, and ending the engagement due to lack of support is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
