I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the librarian) is in the wrong for ending the engagement with her fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, the situation: The librarian was dealing with a 6-year-old grabbing her chest, something she's handled before with gentle reminders. Then a 17-year-old witnesses this and makes a comment, leading to a confrontation. The student then grabs her, and she suspends him. The principal agrees with the 3-day suspension, which will go on his college record. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about this, thinking the punishment is too harsh, calling it a joke, and criticizing her fairness. The librarian feels unsupported and breaks off the engagement.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9. \n\nI need to evaluate the fianc\u00e9's stance. The 17-year-old's action was intentional and inappropriate, unlike the younger kids who are unaware. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that the punishment is a double standard, but the context is different: a teenager making a conscious, likely offensive decision versus a young child's innocent mistake. The fianc\u00e9 also dismisses the seriousness of the act, suggesting it was a joke, which is problematic. The author's job involves maintaining a safe environment, and she took appropriate disciplinary action. Her fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to undermine her professional judgment and her right to feel violated. \n\nThe author's decision to end the engagement is based on feeling unsupported and the fianc\u00e9 not respecting her professional and personal boundaries. The fianc\u00e9's friends also criticize her, adding to the pressure. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the fianc\u00e9's argument lacks support for her experience and judgment. The author acted appropriately in handling the incident, and the fianc\u00e9's response was dismissive and invalidating. Therefore, the author is justified in her decision. The answer is B.\n"
