I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a librarian at a school and she had to deal with a student grabbing her inappropriately. She dealt with it by taking the student to the office, which resulted in a 3-day suspension. Her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision, thinking that the punishment was too harsh, especially since the student was 17 and the younger kids didn't get punished similarly. He accused her of being unfair and targeting the student, and then she broke off the engagement because she felt unsupported. Now, the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The high school student grabbed her in a situation where another student had made a comment, and he did it in front of his friends. The principal agreed that a 3-day suspension was appropriate. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to downplay the seriousness of the older student's actions, comparing it to the younger kids. But the key difference is that the younger kids are not aware of their actions, while the older student was clearly aware but chose to do it anyway, and even apologized by his face. The suspension also affects college records, which the fianc\u00e9 took issue with.\n\nThe author's decision to end the engagement because of his lack of support and his comments about her being unfair and a \"bitch\" seems like a personal choice. The fianc\u00e9's perspective, while maybe not understanding the severity of the situation, doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. She followed the appropriate procedures, and the principal agreed with the punishment. Her fianc\u00e9's friends are now blaming her, but that's their opinion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author acted within her role as an educator to address harassment. The student's actions were intentional, unlike the younger ones. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about not supporting her decision rather than the action itself. So the author isn't in the wrong for taking action or breaking off the engagement because of his unsupportive attitude. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
