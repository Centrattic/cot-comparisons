I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after leaving her fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, the situation: the librarian got a 6-year-old to grab her chest, which she handles by gently moving their hands. Then a 17-year-old sees this, makes a comment, grabs her chest, and gets suspended. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about the suspension, thinks it's harsh, and accuses her of being unfair. She breaks up with him, and now people are calling her AITA.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's correct. \n\nSo, the key points here are the differences between handling the 6-year-old and the 17-year-old. The 6-year-old is a preschooler, not aware of their actions, so the librarian is lenient. The high schooler, on the other hand, is an older student who made a deliberate, inappropriate comment and then grabbed her. The librarian reported him, leading to a suspension. The fianc\u00e9's issue seems to be that he thinks the punishment is too harsh and that there's a double standard since younger kids aren't punished similarly. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction: he's defending the high schooler, saying it was a \"joke\" and that the punishment is unfair. He's accusing her of being biased because she was involved in the punishment. This could be a problem because he's not supporting her in a situation where she felt disrespected and acted within her job's protocols. If he's dismissing her professionalism and the seriousness of the high schooler's actions, that could be a valid reason for the breakup. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9 is unsupportive and undermining her professional judgment, then the author has a valid reason for leaving. However, if the fianc\u00e9's reaction is justified because the punishment was indeed too harsh, then the author might be in the wrong. But in the scenario, the high schooler's actions were more deliberate and serious. The librarian handled the younger kids appropriately, but the high schooler's actions were a clear violation. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's main issue seems to be about the severity of the punishment and the double standard. However, the context of the situation\u2014the high schooler's intentional misconduct versus the younger child's accidental touches\u2014does make a difference. The principal agreed on the suspension, so it's not like she acted alone. The fianc\u00e9's inability to support her in a professional decision, especially when it's about her own safety and dignity, could be a red flag. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving. The fianc\u00e9 didn't support her, dismissed her concerns, and accused her of unfairness when she was acting appropriately. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
