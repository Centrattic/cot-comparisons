I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. She's a librarian at a preK-12 school. A student grabbed her inappropriately, and she took action by suspending him. Her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her, saying the high schooler was just a kid and that there's a double standard compared to younger kids. He accused her of being unfair and told her to take a joke, which led her to end the engagement.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On her side, she was in a situation where she was harassed. The older student intentionally touched her inappropriately after making a joke, which escalated from a young child's accidental touch. She took action as per school policy, which the principal agreed with. Her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her, even after she explained the difference in intent between a 6-year-old and a 17-year-old. His reaction was dismissive and even defensive of the student, which could be seen as invalidating her experience and the appropriate disciplinary action.\n\nFrom the fianc\u00e9's perspective, maybe he thought the punishment was too harsh, especially for a teenager who he believed didn't understand the seriousness. But the key point is that the older student grabbed her intentionally after a provocation, which is a serious offense. The principal backed her decision, indicating the action was justified. The fianc\u00e9's friends are also siding with him, suggesting he might have a support system that's influencing his viewpoint.\n\nThe author's decision to break up is based on feeling unsupported and that her fianc\u00e9 didn't respect her professional judgment and safety. If a partner cannot support you in a matter where you're acting in a professional and justified manner, it can be a red flag for future compatibility, especially regarding respect for each other's roles and safety.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Her actions in the situation were appropriate, and the breakup is a personal decision. However, relationships can be complex. If the fianc\u00e9's reaction was rooted in misunderstanding or a lack of empathy, maybe she had a valid reason to leave. However, if the breakup was impulsive or not given enough time for discussion, that could be seen differently. But given the details, she felt hurt and unsupported, which are valid reasons.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation. The decision to end an engagement is significant, but if based on a lack of support during a serious incident, it might be justified. The fianc\u00e9's comments about her being a \"bitch\" and telling her to take a joke are problematic. His friends' reactions also suggest he might not be handling the situation well.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. Her decision stems from a justified need for support and respect from her partner, which he failed to provide. The suspension was appropriate, and her feelings of being unsupported are valid. Therefore, she is not in the wrong.\n"
