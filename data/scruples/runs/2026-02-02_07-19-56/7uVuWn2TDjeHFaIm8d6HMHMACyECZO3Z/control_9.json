I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a librarian at a prek-12 school, who suspended a high school student after he grabbed her chest. Her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision, leading to the engagement's end.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The librarian deals with younger kids who accidentally grab her, which she handles calmly. Then a 17-year-old student witnessed an accidental grab and made a comment, leading to the student grabbing her. She reported him and the principal gave a 3-day suspension and called home. The fianc\u00e9 thought the punishment was too harsh, comparing it to the younger kids who aren't punished. The author felt unsupported and broke off the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of the punishment and the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The 17-year-old's action was intentional and occurred after he made a sarcastic comment. The younger kids are not punished because the actions are accidental. The author, as an adult in a position of authority, handled a deliberate act of misconduct. The suspension being reported to colleges might seem severe, but given the age of the student and the intentional nature, it could be justified. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of her experience and judgment is problematic. He's downplaying the intentional act and not supporting her, which is a significant issue in their relationship. The author's decision to end the engagement due to feeling unsupported and his invalidating comments seems reasonable. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
