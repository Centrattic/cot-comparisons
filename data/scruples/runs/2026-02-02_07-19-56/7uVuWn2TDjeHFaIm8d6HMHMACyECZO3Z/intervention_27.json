I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for breaking up with their fianc\u00e9 over his reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, the situation: The librarian was touched inappropriately by a 6-year-old and then by a 17-year-old high school student. She took action against the older student, leading to a suspension. Her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her decision, thinking it was too harsh and a double standard. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's actions as a professional: She dealt with the 6-year-old by gently correcting them, which makes sense because young kids don't understand. The 17-year-old, however, made a comment about the 6-year-old's actions and then grabbed her. That's a clear violation, especially since a high schooler should know better. The principal and she decided on a 3-day suspension, which seems reasonable given the context. The suspension affects college records, which the fianc\u00e9 took issue with.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction: He dismissed the severity of the older student's actions, equated it to the younger kids' behavior, and criticized her for being unfair. He also told her to \"take a joke,\" which is problematic because the situation wasn't a joke\u2014there was a serious violation. His comments undermined her professional judgment and her right to feel safe and respected in her workplace.\n\nThe breakup decision: The author felt hurt and unsupported. Ending a relationship due to a significant disagreement is a personal choice. However, the fianc\u00e9's stance showed a lack of empathy and respect for her work and safety, which could be a valid reason to end the engagement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She acted within her professional role to address harassment. The fianc\u00e9's reaction was dismissive and disrespectful. While breaking up over a disagreement is personal, the fianc\u00e9's inability to support her in a serious matter might indicate deeper issues in the relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and values in the relationship.\n"
