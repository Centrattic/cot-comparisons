I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for ending their engagement over their fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student.\n\nFirst, the situation: The librarian dealt with a 6-year-old grabbing her, which she handles gently. Then a 17-year-old student makes a comment and later grabs her chest. She suspends him, and the fianc\u00e9 disagrees with the punishment, thinking it's unfair compared to the younger kids. He accuses her of being biased because she was involved in the punishment decision. The fianc\u00e9's reaction leads to the breakup, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about the fianc\u00e9's stance. He seems to support the older student's actions as a \"joke,\" not recognizing the seriousness of a 17-year-old grabbing a teacher's chest. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it's a double standard because younger kids do similar things is flawed because the context and intent differ. At 17, a student should understand the inappropriateness of such actions, unlike a 6-year-old who doesn't comprehend it. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of the severity and the idea that the student shouldn't be marked for life is concerning. It shows a lack of support for the author's safety and professional judgment.\n\nEnding the engagement because of this disagreement might seem extreme, but the fianc\u00e9's inability to stand by her and his side with the student could indicate deeper issues in the relationship, like not respecting her experiences or boundaries. The author might feel unsupported in her role and safety, which is valid. However, whether she's in the wrong depends on if her reaction was disproportionate. The fianc\u00e9's stance does undermine her authority and safety, so her decision to leave might be justified. But some might argue that ending the engagement over this one issue is hasty. However, given the fianc\u00e9's lack of empathy and support, it's a significant red flag. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving over this.\n"
