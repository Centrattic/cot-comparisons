I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves her breaking off her engagement over her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. She's a librarian at a pre-K to 12 school. Young kids often grab her breasts unintentionally because of their height, and she handles it calmly. Then, a 17-year-old high schooler witnesses a 6-year-old grabbing her and makes a sarcastic comment. She confronts him, he gets lippy, then grabs her. She suspends him for three days, which the principal agrees with. The fianc\u00e9's issue is with the suspension being reported to colleges, arguing it's a harsh punishment for a \"joke,\" and comparing it to the younger kids' behavior. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement.\n\nSo, the key points here are the appropriateness of the suspension and the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The 17-year-old's actions were intentional and escalated from a comment to a physical assault. At 17, he's legally an adult, and his actions were deliberate. The author, as a staff member, has a duty to maintain a safe environment. The suspension seems justified given the nature of the assault and the need to set an example. The fianc\u00e9, however, is downplaying the seriousness, comparing it to younger kids who are not intentionally harassing. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to end the engagement. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be lacking support for her, accusing her of being unfair and telling her to \"take a joke.\" This shows a lack of respect for her experience and judgment as a professional. The author's decision to leave the engagement is based on feeling unsupported and hurt. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author is not in the wrong here. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is problematic because he's not taking the assault seriously and is undermining her. The author acted professionally in handling the incident, and her feelings of not being supported are valid. Ending the engagement over such a fundamental disagreement about respect and support is understandable. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
