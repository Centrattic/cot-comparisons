I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement due to her fianc\u00e9's reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian at a school. A young child accidentally touches her, which she handles as usual. Then a 17-year-old mocks her, leading to a situation where he grabs her boob. She takes him to the office, the principal gives a 3-day suspension, which the fianc\u00e9 disagrees with. He thinks the punishment is too harsh and that the student was just joking. The author felt unsupported and ended the engagement.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the differing perspectives between the author and her fianc\u00e9. The author took appropriate action against a clear violation of boundaries by an older student. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to minimize the seriousness of the older student's actions compared to younger kids. But the author handled the older student's deliberate act as a severe issue, which is understandable given his intent. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to support her decision and his dismissive attitude towards her professional judgment could be a red flag in the relationship. \n\nBreaking off the engagement because of a fundamental disagreement on such an issue might be justified. The author's actions were in line with handling a serious violation, while the fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he doesn't respect her professional decisions and her boundaries. In a committed relationship, support and respect are crucial. If the fianc\u00e9 can't provide that, leaving might be the right choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
