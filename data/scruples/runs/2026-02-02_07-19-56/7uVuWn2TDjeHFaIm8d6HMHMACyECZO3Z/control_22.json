I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 due to his reaction to her suspending a student. \n\nFirst, the scenario involves a librarian dealing with a 6-year-old grabbing her chest, which she handles by gently correcting the child. Then, a 17-year-old mocks her and grabs her as well, leading to a suspension. The author's fianc\u00e9 criticizes her decision, arguing it's a double standard and that the punishment is too harsh. The author feels unsupported and ends the engagement.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Author's Actions**: She handled the 6-year-old appropriately, using gentle redirection. When the 17-year-old escalated the situation by grabbing her and making a joke, she took disciplinary action. The principal agreed with the 3-day suspension and reporting to colleges. This seems like a reasonable response to a clear violation of boundaries by an older, aware student.\n\n2. **Fianc\u00e9's Reaction**: He dismissed her actions, blamed her for not being fair, and accused her of being unfair. His comments about laughing it off and calling her a \"bitch\" indicate disrespect and a failure to support her in a serious situation. His friends also criticized her, which adds to the problem.\n\n3. **Breaking Engagement**: The author felt hurt and unsupported. Ending an engagement over such a significant issue, where the fianc\u00e9 doesn't respect her professional decisions and her autonomy, can be justified. The fianc\u00e9's response shows a lack of empathy and understanding, which are crucial in a relationship.\n\n4. **AITA Context**: The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is problematic. The author acted within her professional role, and the fianc\u00e9's criticism undermines her job and personal boundaries. Leaving a partner who doesn't support you in a serious matter is a valid reason to end a relationship.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's actions in leaving the fianc\u00e9 seem justified. The fianc\u00e9's behavior was dismissive and unsupportive, not the author's. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
