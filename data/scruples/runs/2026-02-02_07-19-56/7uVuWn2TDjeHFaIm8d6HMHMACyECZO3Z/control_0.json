I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.\n\nFor any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say \"watch your hands!\" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.\n\nOne day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, \"LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL.\" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.\n\nI told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a \"joke.\" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.\n\nI tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking off the engagement because her fianc\u00e9 didn't support her after she suspended a student. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a librarian at a prek-12 school. She handles young kids who sometimes touch her inappropriately, but she's used to it and just gently corrects them. Then a high school student, after a younger kid touched her and a comment was made, grabs her, and she suspends him. The school principal backs her up. \n\nHer fianc\u00e9 doesn't support her. He thinks the high schooler was just a kid, same as the younger ones, and that punishing him with suspension is unfair. He accused her of being biased and unfair. She felt unsupported and broke the engagement. Now, people are saying she's being too harsh, but the question is whether she's at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about her reaction to the fianc\u00e9's lack of support. The fianc\u00e9's stance seems to downplay the severity of the high schooler's action. The high schooler intentionally grabbed her, which is different from the younger kids who are unaware. The fianc\u00e9 not only didn't support her but criticized her decision, which led her to end the engagement.\n\nIs she wrong for leaving? Well, in terms of the situation itself, she took appropriate action against the high schooler. The principal agreed with the suspension. The issue is the fianc\u00e9's reaction. If he can't support her job and decisions, maybe that's a problem in their relationship. Breaking off an engagement over lack of support in a professional matter could be understandable. \n\nBut maybe some would argue she overreacted? However, given that the fianc\u00e9 was dismissive and blamed her, it's reasonable for her to feel that he doesn't respect her or her decisions. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
