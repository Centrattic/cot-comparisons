I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not having served, based on the provided scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's son is in the Navy, and they wear Navy-themed clothing and hats given by the son. People have sometimes thanked them for their service, which the author corrects by mentioning their son. The main incident happened at a gun show where someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is the asshole (AITA) here. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the concept of \"stolen valor.\" That term usually refers to someone falsely claiming military service for personal gain or glory. The author isn't claiming to have served themselves but is wearing items related to their son's service. They also correct people when thanked for their own service, which shows they're not pretending to have served. \n\nThe family context is important. The author's son is a service member, and the hats were given by him. Wearing items provided by a serving family member could be seen as a way to show support. However, the line might be crossed if the items are exclusive to those who have actually served in that specific unit. If the squadron hat is meant for members of that squadron, then wearing it without being a member could be problematic, even if the intent is supportive.\n\nBut the author's intent seems genuine\u2014supporting their son. They didn't fabricate their own service; they clarified their relationship when corrected. The person who accused them might have felt that using the squadron's emblem is inappropriate unless you're part of it. However, the author isn't using it to claim service but to show familial pride.\n\nLegal aspects: Stolen valor laws typically target false claims of service. Since the author isn't falsely claiming service, maybe there's no legal issue. However, there's a social and ethical consideration about respecting the significance of military insignia. Some might argue that using squadron-specific gear without being part of it trivializes the service, while others see it as a way to honor the service member.\n\nThe key here is whether wearing items given by a serving family member is acceptable. If the items are meant to be shared with family, then it's okay. But if the items are restricted to those who served in the unit, then it's not. The author might not be in the wrong because they're supporting their son, but the person who accused them could have a point if the hat is for active members only.\n\nIn many cases, families of service members wear related items to show support. However, using specific squadron insignia might be more contentious. The author's explanation and correction when thanked might mitigate the issue, but the fact remains that they're using a specific unit's gear. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intent is supportive, they don't falsely claim service, and the items are from their son. However, there's a gray area with the specific squadron hat. The community might have differing views, but the author's actions don't seem malicious. They are a proud parent, not pretending to have served. So, likely B.\n"
