I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite never having served. The key points here are the definitions of \"stolen valor\" and how the actions align with that.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they have Navy-themed items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. They correct people when thanked for their service, pointing out that it's their son who serves. However, at the gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they never served in.\n\nStolen valor generally refers to falsely claiming to have received military honors or served in the military to gain respect or admiration. In this case, the author isn't claiming their own military service, except when corrected. The main issue is the use of the squadron hat. The hat is specific to a unit their son is part of, which might be seen as more associated with active service members. The other items are generic Navy items, which are more commonly used by families and supporters. \n\nThe person got into a confrontation because wearing a specific unit's hat could be interpreted as implying personal service, even if unintentional. However, the author is clear that they correct others when thanked, which shows intent to clarify their own status. The key is whether using a unit-specific hat without having served in that unit is considered stolen valor. \n\nGiven that the author is a parent of a serving son and uses the items to show support, and they make it clear that the service is their son's, it's more about showing family pride. The problem arises in the specific context of the squadron hat, which might be seen as more exclusive. However, since the author isn't falsely claiming their own service but rather supporting their son, it's a gray area. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the use of the squadron hat crosses the line into implying personal service. If the hat is something that's given by the son and worn as a family member, it's generally acceptable. But if the hat is meant to signify personal service in that unit, then it's problematic. Since the author clarifies their situation when asked, it's likely not intentional, but the confrontation suggests that some people might still take offense. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a potential for misunderstanding, the author's actions are primarily about supporting their son. They don't actively claim service, so they might not be in the wrong. However, the specific use of the squadron hat could be the sticking point. But considering the context and the author's corrections, the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong.\n"
