I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for wearing Navy merchandise without having served. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's son is in the Navy, and they have Navy-themed items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. They wear these to show pride in their son's service. When people thank them for their service, the author corrects them and explains it's their son. But at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing the squadron hat they never served in. Now they're questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is whether using military-themed items without having served is considered stolen valor. Stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming to have served or earned military honors. The author isn't claiming to have served themselves; they're supporting their son. However, the specific instance was wearing a squadron hat, which might be more specific than generic Navy items. The person who confronted them might have felt that using a specific unit's merchandise without having been part of it is misleading. \n\nBut the author has always corrected people when thanked for their service, which shows they aren't intentionally deceiving. They wear the items as a parent supporting their child, not to impersonate a service member. The key here is intent. If the intent is to show support for their son, then it's more about familial pride than false claims. However, the line can get blurry with specific unit gear. \n\nIn the past, similar cases have had mixed outcomes. Some people argue that using military symbols without service is disrespectful, while others see it as a way to honor service members. The fact that the author has a history of clarifying their son's service suggests they're not trying to deceive, but the specific incident at the gun show shows that some people take issue with it. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned they wanted to serve but couldn't due to an injury. This context adds that they have a genuine respect and desire to support the military through their son. Still, the question is about the action of wearing the specific squadron hat. Even if the intent is good, if the effect is causing someone else to feel that valor is being stolen, does that make the author wrong? \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't falsely claiming their own service, but using specific military unit merchandise might cross into a gray area. However, since the intent is to support their son and they've been clear about it in the past, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the confrontation shows that some people do take it as stolen valor. So maybe the answer leans towards \"not in the wrong\" because the intent is genuine and they correct misconceptions, but there's a valid perspective from the other side.\n"
