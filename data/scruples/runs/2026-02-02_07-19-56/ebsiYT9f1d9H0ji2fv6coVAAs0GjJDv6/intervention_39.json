I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite never having served. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they have various items like bumper stickers and hats, some given by the son. They correct people who thank them for their service, explaining it's their son. But at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat. The author is wondering if they're an asshole (AITA) for this.\n\nFirst, what's \"stolen valor\"? That refers to falsely claiming military service to gain sympathy or respect. The author isn't claiming they served; in fact, they correct others when thanked. But they do wear a specific squadron hat from their son. The key here is intent. The author is a proud parent of a serving son, and they wear the hat to show support for their son, not to deceive others into thinking they served.\n\nHowever, the accusation came from someone who felt it was inappropriate. The question is whether using the squadron hat is considered stolen valor. The hat is from the son's assignment, which he gave to the parent. But does wearing a unit hat without having served in that unit cross a line? It depends on the context. If the parent is clearly associated with the Navy because of their son, maybe it's acceptable. But the squadron hat might be more specific. Some might argue that even if the parent isn't claiming they served, using the unit's emblem could be seen as misappropriation of military symbols.\n\nBut the parent has never tried to pass themselves off as a veteran. They correct people when thanked. The issue is the specific squadron hat. The person at the gun show might not know the context. However, the parent's intention is to support their son, which is a common practice among military families. The parent also mentions that every male in their family except them served, so they have a connection but not personal service.\n\nIn many cases, military families show support through merchandise. However, there are guidelines about the use of military insignia. The Department of Defense has specific rules about the unauthorized use of military insignia, which includes unit patches. So, if the hat has the squadron's specific emblem, the author might be violating those guidelines by using it without authorization, even as a parent of a service member.\n\nBut the user's question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal. The parent is not falsely claiming service but is using specific unit gear. The person who confronted them might have a valid point if the squadron hat is considered restricted to those who served. However, the parent's intent is support, not deception. The line here is thin. If the parent is in a situation where they are not in a position to wear the unit's emblem (since they never served there), even if it's given by their son, it might be seen as inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is not trying to deceive anyone. They corrected the initial thanks, showing honesty. The squadron hat might be a grey area, but the parent's actions are driven by pride in their son. The confrontation at the gun show could be a case of misunderstanding. So, is the parent in the wrong? It's possible they are if they are using the specific unit's emblem without authorization, but if the hat was given by their son and they are not claiming to have served, it's a matter of interpretation. The answer hinges on whether the use of the squadron hat is considered misappropriation of military insignia, which could be the case. Therefore, the answer might be A (wrong), but some might say B (not wrong). However, the parent's intent is genuine, but the action might still be considered incorrect due to misuse of the insignia.\n"
