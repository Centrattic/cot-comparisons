I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent wearing Navy-related merchandise because their son is in the Navy. The key points here are about \"stolen valor\" and whether wearing the shwag without having served is inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it refers to falsely claiming military service or awards to gain sympathy or respect. The person in question isn't claiming they served; they're just wearing items related to their son's service. They even correct people who thank them for their service, explaining it's their son.\n\nThe person mentions they have bumper stickers and T-shirts that say \"proud Navy dad\" or \"Navy,\" and they wear hats given by their son. The issue arises when someone accuses them of stolen valor for wearing the squadron hat. The user is asking if this is wrong.\n\nI should consider the intent here. The parent is expressing pride in their son's service, not their own. They have a history of clarifying when people mistake them for a veteran. The problem might be the specific squadron hat, which could be seen as more specific and potentially misrepresentative if someone assumes the wearer was part of that unit.\n\nHowever, the parent is transparent when asked and hasn't actively lied. The term \"stolen valor\" typically applies to false claims of service. Since the parent is upfront and the items are gifts from their son, it's more about familial pride than misrepresentation. The person who accused them might be misunderstanding the situation, thinking the parent is falsely claiming to have served in the Navy or that squadron.\n\nAlso, there's no indication that the parent is trying to impersonate a service member. They are just showing support for their son. The fact that they have a history of correcting others suggests they don't want to mislead anyone. The main issue is the specific squadron hat, which might be more specific than just a general Navy shirt. But the parent's intent is clear: they support their son and are proud of him.\n\nIn the US, there's a legal distinction between wearing military insignia and actual service. Unauthorized use of military insignia can be illegal, but in this case, the items are gifts from the son. The parent is not using them to impersonate a service member but to show family pride. The person who accused them might be conflating family support with stolen valor.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent's actions, while perhaps unintentionally offensive to some, don't constitute stolen valor because they aren't falsely claiming service. They are expressing pride in their son's service, which is different from claiming their own. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
