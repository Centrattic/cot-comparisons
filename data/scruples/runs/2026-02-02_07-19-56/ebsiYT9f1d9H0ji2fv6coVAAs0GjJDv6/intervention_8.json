I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they have Navy-themed clothing and caps given by their son. When someone at a gun show called them out for \"stolen valor,\" the author felt shocked.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming to have served in the military or received military honors to gain sympathy or recognition. The key here is whether the author is misrepresenting themselves as having served.\n\nThe author explicitly states they have never served and are wearing items because of their son. They also correct people when thanked for their own service. The person in the story was wearing a hat from their son's squadron, which might be specific to a unit. The argument is whether using such specific items, even if given by a family member, is considered stealing valor.\n\nSome might argue that wearing military-themed clothing as a family member is a form of support and not misrepresentation. Others might think that using specific unit identifiers (like squadron hats) could be misleading, especially in contexts where military service is expected. The guy at the gun show was upset because the author didn't serve but wore the cap of a specific unit. \n\nHowever, the author isn't claiming to have served; they're a proud parent. The intent is to support their son, not to pretend they served. The line between showing support and misrepresentation might be blurry here. The military often issues items to family members, but in this case, the items are from the son. \n\nIn the U.S., there's a legal aspect to consider too. The Stolen Valor Act targets false claims of military honors. Since the author isn't making false claims about their own service, just wearing items, it's more of a social issue. The key is intent and context. If the author is clear they are a parent, and not claiming personal service, then it's not stolen valor. But if the context leads others to believe they served, that's different. \n\nThe author does correct people when thanked, which shows they aren't trying to deceive. The main issue is the specific squadron hat. However, since the author's son is in the Navy and has given them these items, it's a matter of family support. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Their actions are a form of family support, and they aren't falsely claiming service. The person who called them out might be too strict, but the author's intent is genuine support for their son.\n"
