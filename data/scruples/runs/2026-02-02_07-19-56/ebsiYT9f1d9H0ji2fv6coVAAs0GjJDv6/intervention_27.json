I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items when they haven't served. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they wear caps, T-shirts, and bumper stickers with Navy themes. They correct people when thanked for their service, explaining it's their son. However, at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they didn't earn. The author feels shocked and apologetic but kept the hat on.\n\nFirst, I need to define what \"stolen valor\" is. It refers to falsely claiming military service or honors to gain respect or sympathy. In this case, the author isn't claiming their own service but are using Navy merchandise. The key here is intent. The author makes it clear they're wearing the items in support of their son, not pretending to have served. They correct people when thanked, showing they don't want to be mistaken for service members.\n\nHowever, the person at the gun show took issue with the squadron hat. Squadrons are specific units within the Navy, and the hat from a specific squadron might imply affiliation with that unit. The author's son gave them the hats, so there's a personal connection. But the problem arises when someone assumes the wearer is a veteran of that squadron. The author's explanation (correcting the assumption) might not be seen clearly in the moment, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe broader question is about the legitimacy of civilian support items. The Navy allows civilians to wear certain items, like the \"Navy\" T-shirt, as a sign of support. But squadron-specific gear might be more sensitive because it's tied to a particular unit's service. The key distinction is whether the items are generic support (like a Navy T-shirt) versus unit-specific gear. The user's son gave the squadron hats, so they have a personal link, but others might not know that context.\n\nThe author isn't lying about their own service; they clarify when asked. The issue here is the specific squadron hat. While the author's intent is genuine (supporting their son), the other person felt it was stolen valor. The question is whether wearing unit-specific gear without service is wrong. In many cases, civilians can wear such items if they have a familial connection, but some might argue it's problematic if it misleads. However, the author doesn't claim service, just supports their son. \n\nThe line between support and appropriation is blurry. If the hat is from a specific squadron, the perception might be that the wearer served there. But since the author explains it's their son's, maybe the issue is more about the immediate reaction before the explanation. The author's actions aren't deceptive; they correct misunderstandings. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because their intent is supportive and they clarify their status when asked. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
