I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not having served. The author's son is in the Navy, and they have bumper stickers, shirts, and hats given by their son. When people thank them for their service, they clarify it's their son. But at a gun show, someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in.\n\nFirst, stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service to gain personal benefits or attention. The author isn't claiming they served; they correct people when thanked. The issue here is wearing the squadron hat, which might be more specific than just general Navy items. The person who confronted them might feel that the squadron hat implies direct service in that unit. However, the author is using items given by their son, which is a family connection. \n\nThe line between showing support for a family member and impersonating a service member could be blurry. But since the author is clear it's their son's service and they clarify when necessary, maybe it's not malicious. However, the squadron hat might be seen as more specific and could be misinterpreted. But the key is intent. If the author isn't pretending to have served themselves, just showing pride in their son, then maybe they're not in the wrong. The confrontation was harsh, but the author's actions don't seem to intentionally deceive beyond the specific hat situation. So, probably the answer is B (No), but there's a nuance with the squadron hat. But since the author is upfront and the items are from their son, it's likely not their fault.\n"
