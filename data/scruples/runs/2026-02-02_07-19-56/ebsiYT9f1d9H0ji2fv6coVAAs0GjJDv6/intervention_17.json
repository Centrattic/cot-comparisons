I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise without having served. The author is a proud father of a son in the Navy, using items given by the son. They've been corrected before but now faced backlash at a gun show.\n\nFirst, \"stolen valor\" usually refers to falsely claiming military service. The author isn't claiming personal service but wearing items related to the Navy, which their son is part of. The key is whether wearing the squadron hat constitutes stolen valor. The guy who confronted him might have thought it was the author's own service, but the author was clear in explaining it's their son. However, the hat from a specific squadron might be more associated with actual service members. The author's intention isn't to deceive but to show support as a parent. However, the line between support and misrepresentation can be blurry. The author isn't in the Navy but wears a specific unit's hat, which could be seen as inappropriate. The fact that they corrected others before shows they're aware of the potential issue. Still, using a squadron's hat might be more sensitive than general Navy paraphernalia. So, whether it's the author's fault depends on context. If the hat is specific to a unit and the person was mistaken, maybe not entirely the author's fault. But if the hat is meant for those who served in that unit, then it could be seen as wrong. The answer hinges on whether the items are meant for veterans or supporters. The author's explanation clarifies their position, so maybe not in the wrong. But the confrontation suggests some people find it offensive. So, leaning towards B (not in the wrong), but with nuance.\n"
