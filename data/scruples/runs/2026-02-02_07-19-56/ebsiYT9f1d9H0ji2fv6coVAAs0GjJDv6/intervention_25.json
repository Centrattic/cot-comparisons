I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-themed items without having served, leading to an accusation of \"stolen valor.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it's when someone falsely claims to have served in the military or received honors they didn't earn. It's a form of deception. But the author isn't claiming to have served themselves; they're wearing items given by their son who is in the Navy.\n\nThe author mentions that their son is in the Navy, and they have items like hats and T-shirts that are Navy-related. They clarify that they never served, which is why they corrected people when thanked for their own service. The main issue here is the man at the gun show who accused the author of stolen valor. The author is now conflicted about whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: the items are from the son, the author corrects people who thank them for their service, and the person at the gun show misunderstood, thinking the author was falsely claiming military service. \n\nBut does wearing Navy-themed merchandise given by a family member count as stolen valor? I think the line here is whether the person is falsely representing themselves as having served. The author is not claiming to have served; they are expressing pride in their son's service. However, the man at the gun show might have assumed the author was implying they served because of the hat. \n\nIn the US, there's a legal definition of stolen valor. For example, the Stolen Valor Act of 2013 makes it a federal crime to falsely claim to have received military medals. But general military-themed clothing isn't covered by that. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHowever, socially, some people might feel that even wearing squadron-specific items without having served is appropriation. But since the items were given by the son and the author is transparent when questioned, the social wrong is debatable. The author's intention is to support their son, not to deceive. \n\nThe person at the gun show had a strong reaction, but that's their personal opinion. The author's actions don't meet the criteria for stolen valor as per legal definitions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
