I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite never serving. The situation involves the author's son being in the Navy, and the author has various Navy-themed gear like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by the son. The main issue is when someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming military service or honors to gain praise or respect. The author isn't claiming they served themselves, right? They clarify that they have a son in the Navy and correct people when they're thanked for their own service. However, the person at the gun show accused them of stolen valor because they wore a specific squadron's hat. \n\nThe key points here are: the author has family in the military, they correct others when mistaken, and they wear items given by their son. The problem arises with the specific squadron hat. Even though the author didn't claim personal service, the hat might be seen as representing that unit specifically, which could be more than just general Navy support. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. Supporting a cause or family member doesn't necessarily mean one is in the wrong. However, if the gear is specific to a unit, it might be intended for those who served in it. The author's son gives them the hats, which could imply some legitimacy in wearing them as a family member. But the accuser's reaction suggests that there's a line where even wearing unit-specific gear without having served there could be seen as appropriation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they wanted to serve but couldn't due to an accident. That adds context\u2014they have a genuine respect and support for the Navy but can't serve themselves. However, the issue is whether wearing unit-specific gear is appropriate. \n\nLegal aspects aside, the social aspect is about respect and perception. The author is proud of their son and wears the items as a parent. The accuser's outburst is a social judgment, but whether it's justified is the question. \n\nI think the consensus would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're supporting their son and correcting others when mistaken. However, there's a gray area with unit-specific gear. But since the author clarifies their relationship and the items are from their son, it's more about parental pride rather than false claims. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
