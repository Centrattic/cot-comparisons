I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise without having served. The scenario involves the author's son being in the Navy, and the parent proudly displaying items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. However, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" when they wore a squadron hat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it refers to falsely claiming military service or honors. The key point here is whether the author is actively claiming to have served. The author clarifies that they immediately correct people when thanked for their service, directing the thanks to their son. So they're not pretending to be a Navy member themselves, just expressing pride in their child's service.\n\nThe items they wear are navy-themed but not necessarily specific to their son's unit. However, the specific hat in question is from a squadron their son was assigned to. That might be the issue. If the hat is unit-specific, wearing it could imply a closer connection than just being a parent. But the author mentions that the hat was given by their son, which might mean it's a personal item rather than official military merchandise. \n\nThe person who confronted them called it stolen valor, but the author's actions don't involve lying about their own service. They\u2019re transparent when corrected. The context of a gun show or swap meet, where military pride is likely valued, might make the accusation more heated. However, the author isn't misrepresenting their own service history; they\u2019re supporting their son and sharing his achievements. \n\nLegally and ethically, stolen valor usually applies to false claims of personal service. Since the author is clear about their son's service and doesn't claim to have served themselves, they might not be in the wrong. However, using unit-specific gear could be seen as appropriating the unit's identity, which is a gray area. But the key factor is intent: the author's intent is to support their son, not to falsely represent themselves. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They are expressing pride in their son's service, correct any misunderstandings when they arise, and don't actively lie about their own service history. The confrontation is unfortunate, but the author's actions don't meet the definition of stolen valor.\n"
