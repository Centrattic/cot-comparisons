I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not having served. The question is about whether this constitutes \"stolen valor.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" exactly means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming to have served in the military or received military honors. It's illegal in some contexts, like lying about receiving medals, but the line can be blurry with things like clothing or accessories.\n\nThe author has Navy-themed items given by their son, who is a serving member. They wear these items and sometimes get mistaken for having served. When someone accuses them of stolen valor, they correct them. The key here is that the items are from their son and they clarify when asked. \n\nThe main issue is whether using family members' military affiliations to wear related merchandise is wrong. The author isn't claiming personal service but is wearing items associated with their son's service. Some might argue that it's acceptable because the items are from their son, but others might see it as still being inappropriate, even if well-intentioned.\n\nHowever, the author does correct people when they're mistaken, which shows they're not intentionally deceiving. Also, the items are given by the son, which might support the idea that the son's service is the focus rather than the parent's. \n\nThere's a difference between wearing items that are given by a serving family member versus buying them to falsely claim service. The author's case seems more about family pride rather than impersonation. \n\nBut the person who accused them might be strict about any use of military symbols unless the wearer has served. The legal aspect of stolen valor usually pertains to lying about one's own service. Since the author isn't claiming personal service but is using items from their son, it's more about personal expression and family pride. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on intent and context. If the author isn't falsely claiming their own service and is instead celebrating their son's, they might not be in the wrong. However, others might still take issue with it. But given that they correct people when asked, it's not intentional deception. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
