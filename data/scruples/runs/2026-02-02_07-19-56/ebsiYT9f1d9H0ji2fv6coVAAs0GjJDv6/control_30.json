I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy merchandise without having served. So, the situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they have items like a T-shirt and a hat given to them by their son. The author wears these items and sometimes gets thanked for their service, which they correct. But at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they never served in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it's when someone falsely claims to have served in the military. The term is often used in legal contexts, like in the case of Phil Schneider, where he was prosecuted for lying about his military service. But here, the author isn't claiming to have served; they are just wearing items related to their son's service. \n\nThe author's main point is that they are proud of their son and have items given to them by him. They clarify when people thank them for their service. The key here is whether wearing the hat constitutes \"stolen valor.\" The person at the gun show accused them, but others in the past just corrected them when thanked.\n\nThe author's intention is important. They are not pretending to be a veteran; instead, they are showing support for their son. The items are from their son's squadrons, so there's a personal connection. However, some people might still see wearing a specific squadron's hat as misrepresentation, especially if it's a cap that's typically associated with active members of that unit. \n\nBut legally, \"stolen valor\" usually involves false claims about one's own service. Since the author is not claiming to have served, but rather wearing items from their son, it's more about support than deception. However, the line can be blurry. If the squadron hat is meant to signify membership in that specific unit, then wearing it without having been part of it could be seen as appropriating the unit's identity. But if it's just a general Navy hat, that's different. The author mentions a squadron hat, which might be more specific.\n\nAnother angle is social perception. Even if the author's intentions are genuine, some people might find it offensive because it could confuse others into thinking the wearer is part of the military or that unit. The author does correct people when they're thanked, which shows they're not trying to deceive. But in the case of the gun show, the person took offense, leading to the argument.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a debate here. On one hand, showing support for a family member's service is commendable. On the other hand, using military insignia or specific unit items could be problematic if it's perceived as misrepresentation. The key factors are intent and the potential for deception. Since the author is clear about their son's service when corrected, but still wears the hat, some might argue they're crossing a line if the hat is meant for actual members.\n\nHowever, considering that the items were given by the son and that the author is not claiming personal service, it's more about familial pride rather than theft. The term \"stolen valor\" might be misapplied here, as it's more about lying about one's own service. The author isn't doing that; they're wearing items related to their child's service. \n\nStill, the specific squadron hat could be an issue because it's a more exclusive symbol. If the hat is intended for active members of that squadron, then wearing it as a civilian might be inappropriate. The author's son gave it to them, but if the squadron's policies prohibit giving out such items to non-members, that's a different matter. However, the author doesn't mention any such restrictions, just that the son gave them the hats.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are not intentionally deceptive. They clarify their situation when asked, and the items are from their son. The main conflict arises from someone else's interpretation of \"stolen valor,\" which typically refers to false claims of service. Since the author isn't making such claims, they might not be in the wrong. However, the specific context of the squadron hat could lead to differing opinions. The answer hinges on whether the items are seen as misrepresenting the wearer's own military service.\n"
