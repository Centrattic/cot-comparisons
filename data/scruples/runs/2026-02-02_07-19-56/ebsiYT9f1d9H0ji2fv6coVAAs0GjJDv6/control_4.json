I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who asked the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a parent whose son is in the US Navy. They proudly wear Navy-related merchandise like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son from different squadrons. When people thank them for their service, they correct them, explaining it's their son. However, at a gun show, someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in. The user is asking if they're the asshole for doing this, even though they never served but wanted to, and their injuries prevented them.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming military service or achievements to gain respect or sympathy. The user isn't claiming to have served themselves; they're wearing items related to their son's service. But they might be using Navy branding, which could be seen as appropriating military symbols.\n\nThe key points here are: the user is a proud parent, they correct people when thanked for their own service, and they wear items from their son. The accusation came from someone else at the gun show. The user's intent is to show support for their son, not to falsely claim service. However, some people might find it offensive because the hats are specific to units, and wearing them without service could be seen as misusing military identifiers.\n\nMilitary regulations often restrict the use of certain insignia and unit patches to those who have served in those units. If the hats have squadron patches or specific unit markings, then the user might be violating those regulations by wearing them even though their son is in the Navy. But if the hats are just generic Navy merchandise (like a Navy ball cap without specific unit emblems), it might be different. The user mentions the hats are from different squadrons given by their son, so they likely have unit-specific identifiers. That could be an issue.\n\nHowever, the user's intent is clearly to support their son, and they do correct people when thanked. The person who accused them might be misunderstanding the situation. The user isn't claiming to have served; they're wearing items given by their son as a parent. But if the hats are restricted to active members of that squadron, then even as a parent, using them might be against regulations. However, in practice, many people wear such items as family members, and it's generally accepted as support. \n\nThe user's son is in the Navy, so the items were obtained legitimately. The problem arises when someone else misinterprets the use of the hat. The user isn't lying about their service; they correct people when needed. The accusation of stolen valor is about falsely claiming service, which the user isn't doing. They are using items related to their son's service, so it's more about family support than personal service. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong because their intent is genuine support for their son, and they clarify their actual lack of service when asked. The person who accused them might be too strict about military regulations, but the user's actions don't constitute stolen valor. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
