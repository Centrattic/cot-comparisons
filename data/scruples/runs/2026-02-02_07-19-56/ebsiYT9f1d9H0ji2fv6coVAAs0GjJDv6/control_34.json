I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not serving. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they wear shirts, stickers, and hats given by their son. Someone called them out for \"stolen valor\" when they were just showing pride in their son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming to have served or achieved something in the military that you didn't. So if someone wears a uniform or medals they didn't earn, that's a problem. But here, the author is using items from their son's service. They're not pretending to have served themselves but are showing support for their child.\n\nThe key points here are: the author clarifies when thanked for their own service, the items are gifts from their son, and they're wearing them to show family pride. The person who called them out might have misunderstood the situation. The author isn't falsifying their own service but celebrating someone else's. \n\nHowever, there's a line in some communities about when family members can use military insignia. For example, spouses or parents might have certain allowances. The author's son gave the hats, so maybe that's acceptable. But depending on the specific regulations of the branch or the type of shwag, there could be rules against using military items unless you're a veteran. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they broke a rule. \n\nMorally, if the author is clear that it's their son's service and not their own, they're not misrepresenting themselves. The person who accused them might have been overzealous. The author's actions are about showing family pride, which is common. So the answer would be B (No), they're not in the wrong because they're not falsely claiming service, just supporting their son.\n"
