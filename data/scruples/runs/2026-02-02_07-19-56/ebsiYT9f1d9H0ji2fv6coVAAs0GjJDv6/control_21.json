I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not having served in the military. The main issue here is \"stolen valor,\" which generally refers to falsely claiming military service. But the author clarifies that they never claimed to have served. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has items given by their son, a Navy member. They wear these items as a sign of pride in their son's service. When people thank them for their service, the author corrects them and explains it's their son. So they aren't outright lying about their own service. However, the guy at the gun show accused them of stolen valor for wearing their son's squadron hat. The key points here are intent and deception.\n\nStolen valor typically involves falsifying one's own service. If the author is wearing their son's gear and clarifies it's their son, then there's no deception. But the squadron hat might be more specific. The person who confronted them thought the author was claiming to have served in that particular squadron. The author didn't correct that assumption, which could lead to misunderstanding. \n\nThe author's intent is to show support for their child, which is common. Many people wear similar items for family members. However, the specific squadron hat might be seen as appropriating a specific unit's emblem, which could be more sensitive. The author didn't explain the hat's origin in that instance, leading to the confrontation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't deceive intentionally, but they might have been unaware that the hat could be misconstrued. The line between support and appropriation can be thin. If the hat was personal property from their son, it's less about stolen valor and more about context. However, the person who confronted them might have a point if the hat is meant to denote specific service. The author's mistake was not clarifying the hat's origin when the misunderstanding arose. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't lie about their service and were proud of their son. However, they could have been more proactive in explaining the hat's origin to avoid the confrontation. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), as their actions were not malicious and they corrected others when it came up.\n"
