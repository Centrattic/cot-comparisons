I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The main issue is about wearing Navy-related items without having served. The user's son is in the Navy, and they have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats from different squadrons their son has been in. People sometimes thank them for their service, which they correct, but at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they never served in.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it's when someone falsely claims to have served in the military or received medals they didn't earn. But the author isn't claiming to have served themselves; they're wearing items from their son who is serving. However, the person at the gun show might have thought the author was pretending to have served.\n\nThe author mentions they have never served and had injuries preventing them from joining. They are proud of their son and wear his squadron hats. The key points here are intent and perception. The author's intention is to show support for their son, not to falsely claim their own service. But if someone else interprets it as claiming service, that's a problem. However, the author clarifies whenever someone thanks them for their service, so they aren't actively lying. \n\nIn the past, when people thanked them, they corrected the misconception. At the gun show, the person was upset regardless. So, the question is whether the act of wearing the hat, even with the intention of supporting a family member, crosses into \"stolen valor.\" \n\nStolen valor typically involves deceptive practices to gain respect or benefits by falsely claiming service. The author isn't trying to deceive; they're showing support. The hats and shirts are given by their son, which might be meant for family to show support. However, the line can be blurry. If the public perceives the author as claiming their own service, they might be in the wrong. But the author does correct people when they thank them, which shows they're not trying to deceive. \n\nSome might argue that even if unintentional, wearing military insignia could be seen as appropriating symbols meant for those who served. However, the family is supporting their son, and the items are from him. The situation is different from someone wearing a uniform to pose as a soldier. The author is clearly a civilian but proud of their son's service. \n\nIn the end, whether it's the author's fault depends on intent and context. Since they correct people and aren't trying to falsely claim service, it's more about misunderstanding. The person at the gun show might be too strict, but if the author had worn a uniform or claimed service, it would be different. Since they are wearing items from their son and clarify when asked, it's not their fault. The answer might be B (No).\n"
