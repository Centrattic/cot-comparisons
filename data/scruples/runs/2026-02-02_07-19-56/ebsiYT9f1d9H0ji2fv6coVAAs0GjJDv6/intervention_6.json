I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite never serving. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by the son. When people thank them for their service, the author corrects them and mentions their son. But at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in.\n\nHmm, stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming to have served or received military honors. The author isn't claiming they served; they correct people and clarify it's their son. However, wearing a specific squadron hat might be seen as implying a direct connection. The key points are intent and perception. The author's intent is to show pride in their son, but the person at the gun show perceived it as deception. \n\nI need to consider if the hats from the squadrons are considered service-specific. If the hats are issued to service members, then civilians wearing them might be crossing a line, even if it's from a family member. But the author does correct people when asked, so maybe the issue is the hat itself, which could be more associated with active service. The term \"stolen valor\" is usually about lying, but the author isn't lying; they're just wearing a hat given by their son. Still, the person at the gun show felt it was deceptive. \n\nSome might argue that it's respectful to wear family-related items, but others might see it as inappropriate. The question is whether the author's actions are considered wrong. The fact that the author had the opportunity to clarify and did so when thanked shows they're not pretending to have served. But the initial reaction of the person at the gun show suggests that the hat might be seen as a symbol of service that only those who served should wear. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the hats are specifically from the squadrons and not meant for civilian use, then maybe. But since they are gifts from their son and they do correct people, it's a bit of a gray area. The community might have differing views. However, the term \"stolen valor\" is about deception, and the author isn't deceiving if they correct the misconception. The issue could be more about the item itself being a representation of service. \n\nIn the end, the answer might depend on context. If the hats are clearly intended for service members, then even as a family member, wearing them might be frowned upon. But if the author isn't making claims and corrects when necessary, maybe they're not in the wrong. I think the consensus might be that they're not in the wrong because they're clarifying it's their son, but some people might still take issue with the hat. The main point is that the author isn't pretending to have served themselves, so \"stolen valor\" might not apply here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
