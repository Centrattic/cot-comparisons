I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The author's son is in the Navy, and they wear stuff like shirts and hats given by the son. They corrected people when thanked for their service before, but at a gun show, someone accused them of stolen valor.\n\nStolen valor is when someone falsely claims to have served or achieved something they haven't. But the author isn't claiming to have served; they're proud of their son. They even clarify when people thank them. However, wearing squadron hats might be seen as misrepresenting, especially if the hat is specific to a unit. But the author isn't pretending to be a Navy member; they're supporting their son. The key is intent. If the author isn't trying to deceive but is wearing items given by their son, maybe it's okay. But some might still see it as inappropriate. The line is between showing support vs. impersonating a service member. Since the author isn't claiming to have served and corrects people, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the term \"stolen valor\" is usually about false claims. So the answer might be B.\n"
