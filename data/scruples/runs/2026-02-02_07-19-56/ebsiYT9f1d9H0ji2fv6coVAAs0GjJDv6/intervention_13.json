I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The key points here are the definition of \"stolen valor\" and the intent behind the actions.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they have Navy-themed items like T-shirts and bumper stickers, which they wear because their son is in the Navy. They clarify they never served themselves. When people mistakenly thank them for their service, the author corrects them and redirects the thanks to their son. This seems respectful and honest.\n\nThe incident at the gun show is where the conflict arises. A man accused the author of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat. Stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service to gain respect or admiration. The author did correct people when they were thanked, so they weren't actively lying about their service. However, wearing the specific squadron hat might imply a connection to that unit, even if it's just as a civilian. \n\nThe author's intent was to support their son, not to misrepresent themselves. They did own the hat given by their son, which could be seen as a legitimate way of showing support. But the line between showing support and appearing to falsely claim service can be blurry. The man at the gun show felt deceived, but the author had always been upfront when corrected.\n\nLegally, stolen valor laws mainly target making false claims about service. Since the author didn't lie and corrected others, they might not be in legal trouble. Socially, though, some might still feel it's inconsiderate. However, considering the context and the author's transparency, it's a nuanced situation. The main wrong here might be the misunderstanding rather than intentional deception.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't falsify their service claims, but wearing the squadron hat could be seen as misrepresenting their connection. However, since they corrected others and it's their son's item, the intent wasn't malicious. The answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the actions were supportive and honest, despite the misunderstanding.\n"
