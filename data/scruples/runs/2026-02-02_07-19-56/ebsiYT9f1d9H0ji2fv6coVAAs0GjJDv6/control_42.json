I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation involves a parent of a Navy son who gets called out for \"stolen valor\" at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"stolen valor\" means. It's when someone falsely claims or represents they have military service they haven't actually done. The key here is whether the parent is falsely claiming service themselves or just being a parent of a service member.\n\nThe parent mentions they haven't served, but they wear hats, shirts, and stickers that reference the Navy and their son's service. When people thank them for their service, they correct it, pointing to their son. So they're not pretending to be a service member themselves. However, the person who confronted them at the gun show accused them of stealing valor by wearing the squadron hat.\n\nNow, the question is whether wearing the Navy shwag is inappropriate. The parent is supporting a family member who is in the Navy. They have the hats from their son, so there's no intent to deceive about their own service. The key point is that the parent is clear about the fact that their son is the one serving. \n\nStolen valor laws and societal perceptions usually target those who lie about their own service. In this case, the parent isn't claiming to have served; they correct others when mistaken. However, wearing specific squadron gear might be seen as different because those hats are specific to units the son has been part of. The parent isn't part of that unit, but they are a parent. \n\nBut the parent's actions are more about showing support for their son's service, which is a common thing. Many people wear similar items to support family members. The confrontation at the gun show was because the parent was mistaken for a service member, but they didn't correct that immediately. Wait, in the story, the parent says when someone mistakes them for a service member, they correct them. But in this specific incident, when the guy accused them, they were caught off-guard and didn't correct it immediately. However, they later kept the hat on and no further incidents happened. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? The parent isn't lying about their own service, and they clarify when people thank them for their service. However, the squadron hat might be more specific and could be seen as implying some level of direct affiliation. But since the parent is a family member of the service member, wearing items from the son's unit is a gray area. \n\nIn the U.S., there's a difference between general support (like a Navy flag or shirt) versus specific unit insignia. The parent has the hats from the son's squadrons, so they might be seen as legitimate in a way because they got them from the son. However, the line might be crossed when someone in the military is upset about non-veterans wearing specific unit gear. \n\nBut the key here is that the parent isn't claiming to have served. They are a parent, and their son's service is the reason for the items. The confrontation might be about the sensitivity around specific unit items, but the parent isn't committing fraud or deception. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the parent is not in the wrong) because they are supporting their son and not falsely claiming service. However, some might argue that wearing squadron-specific gear is problematic, but given the context of the parent's actions and corrections, it's more about support than deception.\n"
