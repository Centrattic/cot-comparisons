I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items even though they didn't serve. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they wear stuff like T-shirts, bumper stickers, and hats given by their son. People have sometimes mistaken them for a veteran and thanked them for their service, which they correct.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author is clearly proud of their son and wants to show support. They are not claiming to have served themselves; in fact, they make a point to correct people when they're thanked for their service. The controversy comes from someone accusing them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat. The author apologizes and continues wearing the hat without further issues.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming to have served or received military honors. The question is whether wearing the cap of a squadron they didn't serve in constitutes that. The person isn't lying about their own service; they're using items from their son. The intent here is to support their son's service, not to deceive others into thinking they served. The family's background (other males in the family served) adds context that they might have a tradition of military service, but the individual here didn't. \n\nSome might argue that wearing the hat could mislead people into thinking they served, but the author clarifies when corrected. The fact that they wear items from their son, who is actively serving, shows genuine support rather than trying to appropriate the military's symbols for personal gain. The term \"stolen valor\" is usually reserved for those who falsely claim their own service. Since the author isn't making such a claim and is instead showing support for a family member, it's more of a misunderstanding than an intentional act of deception. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
