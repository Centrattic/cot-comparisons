I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite never serving. So the author's son is in the Navy, and they have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. People sometimes mistake the author as a veteran and thank them, but the author corrects them. However, at a gun show, someone got upset and accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat.\n\nFirst, I need to define stolen valor. Stolen valor is when someone falsely claims to have served in the military to gain respect or recognition. The key here is intent. If the author is wearing the items as a parent of a service member, not as a way to pretend they served, then it's not the same as stolen valor. However, some people might see it as inconsiderate or misleading.\n\nThe author mentions that they correct people when thanked. So they don't actively lie, but they do wear the items. The question is whether the act of wearing the shwag, even as a parent, is considered wrong. Some might argue that the squadron hats are specific to units and could be seen as implying service, even if the person is a family member. Others might say it's a form of support and there's no malice.\n\nThe fact that the author has a physical inability to serve due to an accident adds context. They might be trying to show support for their son and the Navy. But the other person's reaction shows that some people take issue with non-veterans wearing military gear. There's a fine line here. If the author is using the items as a parent, it's different from someone who's trying to pass as a veteran. However, the specific squadron hat might be more contentious than generic Navy shirts.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Arguments against (B) would be that they're supporting their son and the Navy, not pretending to be a veteran. Arguments for (A) would be that even if not intentional, using squadron-specific gear could be seen as appropriating military symbols without service. \n\nI think the key is intent. Since the author corrects others and clarifies it's their son, their intent is genuine support. But the hat from a specific squadron might be more specific and thus cause confusion. However, since the author has no malice and is a parent, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A. But based on the definitions and the author's actions, they're not falsely claiming service. So the answer is B.\n"
