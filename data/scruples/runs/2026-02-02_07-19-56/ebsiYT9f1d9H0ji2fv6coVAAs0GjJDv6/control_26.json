I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats from the different squadrons their son has been part of. The issue came up when someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" actually means. From what I know, stolen valor is when someone deliberately misrepresents themselves as having served or achieved something in the military that they haven't. It's about falsely claiming personal military service or honors. But in this case, the author is clear that they never served and they correct people when thanked for their own service. They explicitly say it's their son's service they're proud of. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent is to show support for their son's service, not to pretend they served themselves. They do correct people when mistaken for a veteran. The person who confronted them at the gun show accused them of stolen valor, but stolen valor usually involves deceitful claims. The author isn't claiming personal service, just supporting their son. \n\nHowever, there's a line about wearing a specific squadron's hat. Even if the author is the parent, wearing a hat from a specific unit might be seen as appropriating the unit's identity. But since the author was given the hat by their son, it's a family memento. The line between showing support and appearing to claim personal membership in a unit is a bit thin. \n\nThe author isn't intentionally misleading people about their own service, but the confrontation shows that some people might take issue with it regardless. However, since the author is upfront about their son's service when corrected, it's probably not malicious. \n\nI should also consider if there are any rules against non-veterans wearing military insignia. In the US, there's no law against civilians wearing military-themed clothing unless it's for fraudulent purposes. Since the author is using items given by their son and not making false claims, they're likely within legal bounds. \n\nThe main question is moral or social. Some might feel that even non-deceptive use of military apparel is inappropriate unless you've served. Others would see it as a way to support active service members. The author's case is about showing pride in their son's service, which is a common sentiment. \n\nIn conclusion, since the author clarifies their relationship to the Navy when asked and the items are family mementos, they aren't in the wrong. The confrontation was likely due to a misunderstanding or the accuser's strict view on the matter. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
