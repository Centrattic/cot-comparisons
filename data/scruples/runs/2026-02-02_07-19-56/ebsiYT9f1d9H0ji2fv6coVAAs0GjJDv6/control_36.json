I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise without having served. The situation is that their son is in the Navy, and they have items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. People usually mistake them for a veteran and they correct them, but one person accused them of stolen valor.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what stolen valor means. Stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming to have military service or honors one hasn't earned. The key here is whether the author is actively misrepresenting themselves as a veteran. The author clarifies that they are not a veteran and corrects people when they're mistaken. However, they do wear the squadron hat, which might be seen as implying personal service.\n\nThe user mentions that the person at the swap meet called it stolen valor. The author's defense is that they're a proud parent of a serving son. But the line is blurry. Wearing a specific squadron's hat could be seen as taking credit for that unit's service, even if it's the son's. The items are given by the son, which might be a factor. \n\nLegal definitions might matter here. In some cases, wearing military insignia without authorization is illegal. However, the author is wearing items given by their son, which could be a gray area. But morally, is it wrong? Some might argue that showing support as a parent is different, but others might feel it's appropriative if it's taken as personal service. \n\nThe author's intention is to show support for their son and the Navy. They don't claim service themselves. The problem arises when others interpret the attire as claiming service. The key is whether the author is misleading people. They do clarify when corrected, but the initial use of the items might still be problematic. \n\nStolen valor laws often focus on false claims. Here, the author isn't claiming service, but the attire might imply it. There's a difference between supporting a family member and implying personal service. The person who confronted them might be strict about it, but others might be more understanding. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be seen as inappropriate by some due to the potential for misunderstanding, but they aren't intentionally misrepresenting themselves. However, the line is thin. Depending on the perspective, the answer could vary. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and considering the confrontation, it's a close call. The fact that they wear items from their son's squadron could be seen as taking his service as their own, which is where the issue lies. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because it's about the perception and the potential for misleading others, even if unintentional.\n"
