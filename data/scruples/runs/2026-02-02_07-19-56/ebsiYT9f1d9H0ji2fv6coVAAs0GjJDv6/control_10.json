I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them wearing Navy-related items like stickers, shirts, and a hat they received from their son, who is in the Navy. People have thanked them for their service, but they correct them, saying it's their son. However, at a gun show, someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in.\n\nFirst, I should consider what stolen valor is. Stolen valor usually refers to someone falsely claiming to have served in the military or received honors to gain sympathy or recognition. The key here is whether the person is misrepresenting themselves as having served.\n\nThe author clarifies they have never served and explain their son is in the Navy. They wear items given by their son, which are legitimate Navy squadron hats. When people thank them, they correct the misconception. The issue is that someone at the gun show accused them of stolen valor because the hat is specific to a squadron they didn't serve in.\n\nI need to think about whether wearing a squadron hat from their son's unit is problematic. The author isn't claiming to have served in that squadron themselves; they're a proud parent supporting their son. The items are souvenirs from the son, so maybe they have permission to use them. Stolen valor typically applies to wearing uniforms or medals one hasn't earned. Here, it's merchandise, not official military gear. The intent seems to be showing support for their son, not impersonating a service member.\n\nHowever, the line can be blurry. If the hat is specific to a squadron and only issued to those who served there, wearing it without service could be seen as appropriating the unit's identity. But since the author's son is in that squadron, the hat was given to them, so maybe they're allowed to wear it as a family member. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nAlso, the author's intent is important. They correct people when they're mistaken about their service, showing they don't want to falsely claim it. The confrontation at the gun show might have been a misunderstanding, especially since the author isn't trying to pretend they served. The key question is whether the hat's use is considered inappropriate in the military community. If the hat is strictly for members, then the author might be in the wrong. But if family members are allowed to wear such items to support their loved ones, then it's okay.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're not falsely claiming to have served. They're a parent showing support for their son, and the items are from the son's service. Stolen valor is about deception, but the author is upfront when corrected. The person who accused them might be overly strict, but the author didn't intend to mislead. So the answer would be B (No), they aren't in the wrong.\n"
