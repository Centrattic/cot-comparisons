I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy merchandise even though they never served. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they wear items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. The key issue here is whether this constitutes \"stolen valor,\" which typically refers to falsely claiming military service to gain sympathy or respect.\n\nFirst, the author clarifies that they have never served and corrects people when they're thanked for their service. They mention that they wear the hats and shirts as a proud parent, not as a veteran. The main conflict happened when someone accused them of stolen valor at a gun show. The author then apologized but kept the hat on.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Stolen valor usually involves falsely representing oneself as having served. The author is not claiming personal military service; instead, they're showing support for their son. However, wearing squadron-specific hats might be more sensitive because those could be associated with specific units. But the author says they corrected people when thanked, showing they aren't pretending to have served. \n\nThe line might be blurry here. While some might argue that any military gear should be reserved for those who served, others see it as a way to show family support. Since the author is transparent about their son's service and not impersonating a veteran, they might not be at fault. However, some could still feel it's inappropriate regardless. The key points are the intent (supporting family) and the correction when mistaken.\n"
