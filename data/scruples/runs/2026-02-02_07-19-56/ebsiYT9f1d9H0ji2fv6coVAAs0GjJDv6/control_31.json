I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The main issue here is \"stolen valor,\" which refers to falsely claiming military service. \n\nFirst, the author's son is in the Navy, and they wear items like T-shirts, bumper stickers, and hats given by their son. They correct people when mistaken for a veteran. But at a gun show, someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat.\n\nI need to consider if wearing the squadron cap is the same as false claims. The author isn't claiming to have served; they clarify when people thank them. The hats were given by their son, so they have a personal connection. However, a squadron-specific cap might be more associated with active service, and even if the author isn't claiming to be a veteran, the item could imply that. \n\nBut the key points are: they correct people when mistaken, the items are from their son, and they haven't made false claims. The person at the gun show might have been overly strict. However, using a specific unit's gear without having been part of it could still be seen as inappropriate by some. \n\nIn the US, there are laws against false military representation, but unless the author is impersonating a service member, it might not be illegal. But socially, there's a line between showing support and implying personal service. Since the author isn't making false claims and is wearing items connected to their son's service, it's likely they're not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
