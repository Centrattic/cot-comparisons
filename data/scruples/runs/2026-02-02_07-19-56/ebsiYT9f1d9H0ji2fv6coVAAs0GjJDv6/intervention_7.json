I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation involves the author's son being in the Navy, and the author proudly wearing related merchandise. They've had people thank them for their service, which they correct, explaining it's their son. However, at a recent event, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it refers to falsely claiming military service or honors to gain sympathy or respect. The key here is intent. The author hasn't served, but they're wearing items associated with their son's service. They clarify when people thank them, so there's transparency.\n\nThe main issue is whether wearing the squadron hat constitutes stolen valor. The author isn't claiming personal service but is wearing a specific unit's hat. The person who confronted them felt it was deceptive. The author's intention is to support their son, not to misrepresent their own service. However, the squadron hat might be seen as more specific and could be interpreted as claiming personal association with that unit, even if it's not the case.\n\nThere's a difference between general Navy merchandise and unit-specific gear. General items like a Navy T-shirt are more about supporting the branch overall, but a squadron hat could imply direct involvement with that unit. Even if the author corrects people when thanked, the presence of the hat might lead others to assume they served there. The confrontation shows that some people take issue with this, even if the author's intent is innocent.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their son has given them these items. That adds another layer\u2014since the son is in the Navy, they might have a legitimate connection to the items. However, the squadron hat's use is the point of contention here. The question is whether the specific unit affiliation is misleading.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a line between supporting a service member and falsely claiming service. The author isn't fabricating personal service but is using items that could be mistaken for personal service. The key is whether the action is deceptive. Since the author is upfront when corrected, but the initial act might be seen as implying service, it's a gray area. However, the term \"stolen valor\" typically applies to false claims of one's own service. Here, the author is supporting their son, not falsely claiming their own. So maybe the answer leans toward not being in the wrong. But the use of the specific squadron hat might tip it into being in the wrong because it's more specific and could be seen as exploiting the unit's identity without having served there. Different people might have different views, but the confrontation suggests that some see it as problematic despite the author's intentions.\n"
