I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation involves a parent whose son is in the Navy. They have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. When someone at a gun show thanked them for their service, the author corrected them and mentioned their son. However, a person accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing the squadron hat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it's when someone falsely claims to have served or earned military honors. The key here is whether the author is falsely claiming service themselves. The author is clear they never served, but they are wearing items from their son. They also correct others when they're mistakenly thanked for their own service, redirecting the praise to their son.\n\nThe main issue is if wearing the squadron hat constitutes stolen valor. Since the author has never served, but the hat is from their son's unit, is that inappropriate? The author's intention seems to be showing support for their son's service, not claiming their own. However, the hat itself might be associated with a specific unit, and wearing it could imply a connection. But the author clarifies it's their son's service, so maybe the issue is the context in which they present it.\n\nThe person at the gun show accused them, but the author didn't claim service themselves. They were just wearing a gift from their son. The author's actions seem to be within the bounds of family support, similar to how parents of soldiers wear \"support our troops\" gear. However, there's a line when it comes to specific unit insignia. Some people might take issue with non-veterans wearing unit-specific gear, even if the intention is supportive. But the author doesn't claim to have served in that unit, only that it's their son's.\n\nLegally, stolen valor refers to false claims about one's own military service. The author isn't falsely claiming their own service; they're acknowledging it's their son's. The moral or social aspect is more nuanced. Some people might find it insensitive or misleading, others might see it as a proud family member supporting their son. The fact that the author corrects others when they're mistaken suggests they're not trying to deceive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't falsely claiming their own service, so they aren't committing stolen valor. Their actions are more about showing support for their son's service, which is common and even encouraged. The conflict arises from a misunderstanding, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
