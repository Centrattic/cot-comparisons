I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is wrong for wearing Navy-related items even though they never served, leading to an accusation of stolen valor.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what stolen valor is. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming to have served in the military or received military decorations. But the author isn't claiming to have served themselves; they're a parent whose son is in the Navy. They wear items given by their son, like hats and T-shirts, and bumper stickers that say \"proud Navy dad.\" They correct people who thank them for their service, redirecting it to their son.\n\nThe key points here are that the author is not pretending to be a service member. They clarify when someone mistakes them. They have a legitimate reason for the items\u2014they were given by their son. The person who confronted them called it stolen valor, but I think stolen valor specifically involves lying about one's own service. The author isn't lying about their service; they're expressing pride in their son's service. \n\nHowever, there might be a gray area. Wearing squadron-specific items could be seen as appropriating the symbols of a specific unit, even if it's through family ties. But the main point is intent. The author's intent is to show support and pride for their son, not to falsely claim service. The confrontation is more about the item's association with a specific squadron, not the overall service pride. \n\nStolen valor laws typically target individuals who falsely represent themselves as having served or achieved military honors. Since the author is not doing that, and in fact corrects people when they assume service, it's more of a misunderstanding. The person who confronted them might not be aware that it's a parent's item, not the wearer's own. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing family pride, not falsely claiming service. The confrontation was a miscommunication, and the author's actions don't constitute stolen valor. So the answer should be B.\n"
