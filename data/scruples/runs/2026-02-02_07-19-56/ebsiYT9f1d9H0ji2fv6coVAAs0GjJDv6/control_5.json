I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent wearing Navy merchandise because their son is in the Navy. They get called out for \"stolen valor\" by someone at a gun show. The key points here are the definitions of stolen valor and the intent behind the actions.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to someone falsely claiming to have served in the military or received military honors. The author is clear that they never served, but they're wearing items given to them by their son, who is serving. The question is whether this constitutes stolen valor.\n\nThe author corrects people when they're thanked for their service, which shows they're not pretending to have served. The issue here is the specific squadron hat. The person who confronted them accused them of wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in. The author is wearing a hat from a squadron their son is part of, not one they themselves served in. \n\nThe key point is intent. The author is proud of their son and is wearing items as a parent of a service member, not as a former service member. They don't claim to have served when corrected. However, the squadron hat might be seen as representing that specific unit, which the author hasn't served in. But the author isn't claiming to have served in that unit; they're just a parent of someone who does. \n\nStolen valor laws usually target false claims of personal service or medals. Since the author isn't making those claims, but the person might feel that wearing the hat is misleading. However, the hat is a gift from the son and part of the family's pride. The author isn't misrepresenting their own service, just their son's. \n\nIn the case of items like this, especially if they're given by the service member, it's often a way for families to show support. The confrontation might stem from the person's misunderstanding, thinking the author is claiming to have served in that specific squadron. But the author's intent is clear when they correct others about their own service. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer likely depends on the intent and whether they're making false claims. Since they're not falsely claiming their own service and are upfront when corrected, they probably aren't in the wrong. The person who confronted them might have overreacted, not considering the context of the family's pride. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
