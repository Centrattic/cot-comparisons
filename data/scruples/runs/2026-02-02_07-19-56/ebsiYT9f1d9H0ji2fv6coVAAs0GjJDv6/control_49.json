I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related gear without having served. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they have items like hats and T-shirts, mostly gifted by the son. They got called out for \"stolen valor\" at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what stolen valor means. Stolen valor is when someone falsely claims or represents military service to gain respect or benefits. The key here is whether the author misrepresented their own service.\n\nThe author mentions they never served but have Navy items. They correct people when thanked for their service, explaining it's their son. However, someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a specific squadron hat. \n\nThe debate is whether wearing Navy merchandise, even if not one's own service, is inappropriate. The author's intent is to show pride in their son's service, not to falsely claim their own. They're not wearing medals or ranks, just shirts and hats. The squadron hat was a gift from their son, so maybe that's a factor. \n\nLegally, in the US, stolen valor laws typically apply to false claims of personal service. Wearing unit patches or hats might not be illegal if the person is a family member. The issue is more about social perception. Some might find it insensitive, especially if others are actively serving and take issue with the symbols being used by non-veterans.\n\nBut in this case, the author is a parent of a serving son. Their actions are to show support. The person who confronted them might have had a strong reaction, but the author is correcting the misunderstanding when people thank them. The main question is whether the author's actions cross the line into appropriation. \n\nConsidering the context, the author isn't falsifying their own service but supporting their child. So, the answer might be that they are not in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. The key points are intent, correction of misunderstandings, and the fact that the items are gifts from their son. The confrontation might stem from misunderstanding, but the author isn't falsely claiming service. So, likely answer B.\n"
