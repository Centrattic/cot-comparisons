I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite never serving. The key points here are the context and the concept of \"stolen valor.\"\n\nFirst, the author's son is in the Navy, and they proudly wear items like T-shirts and hats given by their son. They correct people who thank them for their service, redirecting it to their son. That shows they're not trying to pass themselves off as a veteran. \n\nThe incident at the gun show happened when someone accused them of stolen valor. The author was just wearing a squadron hat, which their son had provided. Stolen valor usually refers to falsely claiming military service to gain praise or respect. In this case, the author is using items associated with their son's service, not their own. \n\nThe family history also mentions that every male in their immediate family served except them, and they had a valid reason preventing enlistment. This adds context that their connection to the Navy is through their son, not personal service.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether wearing the shwag constitutes stolen valor. Since the author isn't claiming to have served themselves and corrects people when mistaken, they aren't falsely representing their own service. The squadron hat was a gift from their son, so it's a familial connection rather than personal valor. \n\nHowever, some might argue that wearing the hat could imply personal service, but the author has consistently clarified their role. The person who confronted them might have misunderstood, but the author's actions don't seem malicious. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't intentionally deceiving anyone. They're celebrating their son's service, not their own. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
