I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise despite not having served. The story is from a parent whose son is in the Navy. They have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. People have occasionally mistaken them for a veteran and thanked them, but they corrected that it's their son.\n\nThe key issue here is \"stolen valor.\" The author didn't serve, so wearing a squadron hat might be seen as taking credit for service they didn't do. But the parent is wearing items given by their son, who is serving. The line between showing pride in a family member and impersonating a service member is thin here.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service. The author does correct people when thanked, so they aren't directly lying. They're wearing items that are associated with the Navy but not necessarily indicating their own service, especially since they clarify it's their son. However, the squadron hat might be more specific and could be seen as implying some level of personal connection beyond just being a parent.\n\nThe person who confronted them called it stolen valor, which is a strong accusation. But the author's intent is to show support for their son. The family's history with military service (other family members served) might add context. The accident preventing them from serving is mentioned, which adds nuance\u2014they wanted to serve but couldn't.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on intent and perception. If the Navy items are given by their son as a gift, and the author is clear that it's about their son, then it's not stolen valor. However, the specific squadron hat might be seen as taking on a specific military identity that only those who served in that unit would wear. The author's actions might be seen as insensitive or inappropriate if it offends others, even if unintended. But unless they are falsely claiming service, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the confrontation suggests that some people see it as stolen valor regardless of intent. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they are showing support for their son and correct others when necessary. But the squadron hat's specificity might tip it into A. Hmm, tricky. The line is blurry, but I think the author isn't in the wrong because their actions are to show support for their son, not to falsely claim service. So answer B.\n"
