I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation involves the author's son being in the Navy, and he's wearing stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by his son. People have sometimes mistaken him for a veteran and thanked him, which he corrects. Then there was an incident at a gun show where someone accused him of stolen valor.\n\nFirst, I need to define what stolen valor is. From what I know, stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming to have served in the military, especially with the intent to deceive. The key here is intent and whether there was a misrepresentation of service.\n\nThe author is not a veteran and hasn't served. He's wearing Navy-themed clothing and bumper stickers that say \"proud Navy dad\" and similar. The main point is whether wearing these items counts as false representation. If someone thanks him for his service and he clarifies that it's his son, that shows he's not pretending to have served. \n\nThe problem arises when someone accuses him of stolen valor. The author isn't claiming to have served himself. He's expressing pride in his son's service. The items are given to him by his son. However, the term \"stolen valor\" is usually about claiming personal military service. If the clothing items don't explicitly claim he served (like a military ID or specific insignia that denote service), then he's not committing stolen valor. \n\nBut maybe the issue is the perception. If the hat from the squadron is something that only veterans or active members should wear, then even if he's not claiming to have served, wearing it could be seen as misrepresentation. However, the hat was given by his son, so that adds context. The son is part of the Navy, so the hat is a family item. \n\nThe line may be blurry. If the person at the gun show took offense because the hat implies service, but the author was clear that it's his son, then the author isn't in the wrong. The accuser might be misunderstanding the context. \n\nAlso, the author's actions are about supporting his son's service, not his own. The correction when people thank him shows he's not trying to deceive. The term \"stolen valor\" is a legal term, but in common usage, it's about lying about one's own service. Since the author is not doing that, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's showing pride in his son, not himself. The confusion comes from others projecting their own expectations onto the items he wears, but his intent is genuine.\n"
