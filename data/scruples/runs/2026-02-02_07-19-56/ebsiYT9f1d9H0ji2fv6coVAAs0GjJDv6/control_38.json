I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise without having served in the military. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's son is in the Navy, and they wear Navy-themed items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. When people mistakenly thank them for their service, they correct them and explain it's their son. However, at a recent event, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they never served in. The author is now questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nNow, considering the concept of \"stolen valor,\" which typically refers to falsely claiming military service to gain respect or sympathy. The key here is whether the author is misrepresenting their own service. The author does correct people when thanked for their service, clarifying that the service is their son's. This seems honest. However, the issue might be about wearing specific squadron merchandise. \n\nMilitary branches have specific insignias and items that\u6807\u8bc6 their units. Wearing a squadron hat that belongs to a specific unit could be seen as claiming affiliation with that unit. Since the author hasn't served in the military, using that specific unit's merchandise might be considered inappropriate, even if they're proud of their son. \n\nThe line between supporting a family member and impersonating service might be thin here. If the hats are official squadron items meant for active or veteran members, then wearing them without service could be problematic. However, if the hats are available for purchase by the public, like general Navy merchandise, it might be more acceptable. \n\nThe user's main point is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are intent and the context of the items. The author isn't claiming their own service but is wearing items connected to their son's unit. The argument against them could be that the specific squadron hat is a form of false representation, while the defense is that they're supporting their son's service. \n\nIn the past, similar cases have varied. Some view wearing any military-related gear as support, while others see specific unit items as reserved for those who served. The reaction from the man at the gun show suggests that he took it as stolen valor, but the author did correct the initial misconception about their own service. \n\nSo, balancing intent vs. perception, the author's actions might not be malicious, but the specific use of a squadron hat could be seen as crossing a line. However, since they're not claiming their own service and it's their son's gear, some might argue it's still acceptable as a family member's support. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the specific squadron merchandise is meant for active members. If so, the author might be in the wrong. If it's general Navy gear, then not. The post mentions the hat was given by the son from the squadron he's assigned to, so it's likely an official item. Therefore, wearing it without service could be considered inappropriate, making the author the asshole.\n"
