I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who's wearing Navy gear but hasn't served themselves is in the wrong. The situation is about \"stolen valor\" accusations.\n\nFirst, the parent has a son in the Navy and wears related items like hats and T-shirts. They correct people who thank them for their service, redirecting it to their son. The main issue arose when someone accused them of stealing valor by wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service to gain praise or respect. The parent isn't claiming they served; they have a family member who did. However, wearing specific unit insignia might be more sensitive. The squadron hats are from the son's assignments, so they have a connection, but they aren't serving themselves.\n\nBut does wearing the hat imply service in that unit? The parent explicitly says it's their son's service. The person who confronted them might have misinterpreted the hat as the parent serving. However, the parent corrected the initial thanks for service, so maybe they were clear. The key is intent: the parent isn't falsely claiming service but supporting their son. However, the squadron hat might be seen as misusing the unit's specific identity. \n\nIf the parent is wearing a general Navy shirt, it's more about supporting the Navy. But a specific squadron hat could be more about the unit's identity, which might require having served there. The parent hasn't served in any military, so wearing that specific gear might cross the line. \n\nBut the parent got the hats from their son, so there's a legitimate connection. The confrontation was about the specific hat, not the general support. The parent's actions are not deceptive since they corrected the thanks. Still, the line between supporting a family member and appropriating specific unit symbols is blurry. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intent is genuine support, and they aren't falsely claiming service. The squadron hat might be problematic if it's meant for those who served there, but since the parent has a direct familial link, it's a gray area. However, the accusation of stolen valor is more about false claims, which the parent isn't making. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
