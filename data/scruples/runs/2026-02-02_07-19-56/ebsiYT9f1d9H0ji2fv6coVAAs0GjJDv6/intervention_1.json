I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not having served. The author's son is in the Navy, and they have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. They correct people when thanked for their service, and once, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to define \"stolen valor.\" From what I know, it refers to falsely claiming military service or medals to gain respect or sympathy. The author isn't claiming they served; they correct people when thanked. However, wearing specific unit or squadron gear might imply service, even if unintentionally. The key here is whether the clothing is likely to be mistaken for actual service.\n\nThe author mentions they wear hats from the specific squadrons their son has been in. These items might be more specific than general \"Navy\" shirts. People might not realize the difference between general Navy pride and unit-specific gear. The person who confronted them might have felt the squadron hat was a misrepresentation.\n\nBut the author's intent is supportive of their son's service. They explain their situation when corrected. However, the issue is whether the appearance is misleading. If someone sees a squadron hat, they might assume the wearer served in that unit. Even if the author didn't mean to deceive, the result could still be perceived as stolen valor.\n\nOn the other hand, many civilians support the military and wear related merchandise without serving. General items like \"Navy\" shirts are common. The problem might be the specificity of the squadron hat. The line between support and misrepresentation could be thin here.\n\nLegally, stolen valor involves false statements. Since the author corrects people when asked, there's no direct false claim. But socially, the perception matters. The confrontation at the gun show shows that some people take it as misrepresentation. So, while the author's intent is genuine support, the potential for misunderstanding exists. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't intentionally deceptive, but the specific squadron gear might lead others to believe they served. This could be seen as the author being in the wrong, even if unintentionally. However, others might argue that supporting family members in the military justifies wearing such items. The answer hinges on intent vs. perception and the specific items worn.\n"
