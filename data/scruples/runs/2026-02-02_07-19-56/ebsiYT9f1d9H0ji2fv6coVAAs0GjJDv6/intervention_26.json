I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation involves the author being a proud parent of a son in the Navy, wearing shirts, bumper stickers, and squadron hats given by the son. When someone accused them of \"stolen valor,\" the author felt bad but kept the hat on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it refers to falsely claiming military service or achievements. The author isn't claiming to have served; they clarify whenever someone thanks them. They wear the items as a parent supporting their son. However, the line might be blurry. The squadron hats are specific to units the son has been in, so maybe the person at the gun show felt that the cap was misused because it's associated with actual service members. \n\nThe author's intention is clear: they're showing support for their son. But does wearing a squadron hat without having served in that unit count as stolen valor? Some might argue that any use of military insignia by non-members is inappropriate, while others see it as a form of support. The fact that the author is upfront when questioned might mitigate the issue, but the accusation came up in a public setting where people might not know the context. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that other males in their family served, but they couldn't due to an accident. That might add context about their personal connection, but not necessarily excusing the current situation. \n\nI think the key points are: the author isn't falsely claiming service, they're supporting their son, and they correct people when necessary. However, the use of specific squadron insignia could be seen as problematic by some. The person who confronted them might have a valid point if they believe only those who served should wear such items. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they are not making false claims and are clear when questioned, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if they are using the squadron hat in a way that could be misleading in public, then maybe they are. It's subjective. \n\nI need to decide between A and B. The user thinks A (in the wrong), but I need to consider both perspectives. The fact that the author is a parent might give them a legitimate reason to show support, but the line between support and misrepresentation is thin. The term \"stolen valor\" is about deception, but the author isn't deceptive\u2014they clarify when asked. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might still argue it's inappropriate regardless. Hmm.\n"
