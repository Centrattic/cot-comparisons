I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy merchandise without having served. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they wear items like hats and shirts with Navy-related stuff. When someone thanked them for their service, they corrected them and mentioned their son. But at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in. The author is wondering if they're an a**hole for this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" actually is. From what I know, it refers to falsely claiming military service to gain sympathy or respect. But here, the author is wearing the hats and shirts but corrects people when they thank them, redirecting to their son. The key point is whether wearing the merchandise without having served is considered misleading or deceptive.\n\nThe author does clarify when someone thanks them, so they aren't actively lying. They explain that their son is the one in the Navy. The problem arises when someone accuses them of stolen valor. However, the items themselves (like the hat from the squadron given by the son) might be intended for family members. Military units often give items to family, and wearing them as a parent might be seen as supportive rather than claiming service. \n\nBut some people might still see it as inappropriate, especially if the hat is specific to a squadron and is meant to represent active service in that unit. The line between support and misrepresentation could be thin here. However, since the author is clear when confronted and the items are from their son, it's more about supporting their family member rather than falsely claiming service. \n\nAlso, there's a difference between wearing general Navy gear (like a shirt saying \"Navy\") versus a specific squadron hat. The squadron hat might be more associated with actual service in that unit. However, if the son is part of that squadron and gave the hat, the parent wearing it could be seen as a family member showing support. \n\nThe concept of \"stolen valor\" usually involves someone falsely claiming to have served for personal gain, which isn't the case here. The author is not claiming their own service but is using items given by their son. The main issue is the perception of others, but as long as the author is honest when asked, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong) because they are supporting their son and correcting others when necessary, even if some people disapprove.\n"
