I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not having served. The situation involves the author's son being in the Navy and the author wearing hats and shirts with Navy themes. The key points here are about stolen valor and how others perceive this.\n\nFirst, the author clarifies that they have never served but are proud of their son. They mention that when people thank them for their service, they correct them and redirect it to their son. The main issue arose when someone accused them of stolen valor at a gun show.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service or medals to gain praise or respect. However, the author isn't claiming to have served; they are wearing items related to their son's service. The hats and shirts are given by the son, which might indicate some level of officiality or family pride. But the problem is whether wearing such shwag without having served is considered inappropriate.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author isn't impersonating a sailor or making false claims about their own service. They correct people when thanked for their service, which shows they are upfront about their son's role. The other person's reaction was about the cap from a specific squadron, which might be seen as more specific and possibly more associated with active service members.\n\nHowever, many families of service members wear related apparel as a sign of support and pride. It's common for parents, spouses, etc., to wear military-themed clothing. The line is crossed when someone uses military insignia or specific unit patches to falsely represent their own service. In this case, the author is using items from their son's assignments, which could be seen as a way to show support rather than false claims.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the cap has a specific squadron's emblem, which is usually reserved for those who have served in that unit, wearing it without being part of that unit might be frowned upon. However, since the author's son is in that unit and gave the hat, it might be a family tradition or a way to show solidarity. The key is whether the author is using the items to imply their own service or if it's a family tradition to honor their son.\n\nThe person who accused them might be strict about military traditions, viewing any non-service member wearing unit-specific gear as inappropriate. Others might see it as a form of support. The author's intent was to show pride in their son, not to claim their own service. Since they corrected people when thanked, it seems honest.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a debate on the appropriateness, the author isn't making a false claim about their own service. They're showing support for their son, which is common. The accusation of stolen valor might be a misunderstanding. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
