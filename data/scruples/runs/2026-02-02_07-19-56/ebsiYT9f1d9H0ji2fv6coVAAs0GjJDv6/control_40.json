I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wearing Navy gear without having served. The key points here are about \"stolen valor\" and the reactions they got.\n\nFirst, the author's son is in the Navy, and they wear items like hats and T-shirts given by the son. They clarify they never served but wanted to, but an accident prevented it. They correct people when thanked for their own service. \n\nThe issue arises when someone accuses them of \"stolen valor\" at a gun show. Stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service. The author isn't claiming they served but are wearing items associated with their son's service. The key here is intent. The author is supporting their son and is proud of his service, not pretending to have served themselves. \n\nHowever, the line can be blurry. Wearing squadron-specific gear might imply service in that unit, which could mislead some. But the author is upfront when confronted, explaining their son's service. The person who accused them might be conflating the family support with false claims. \n\nAlso, the author's actions are common among military families. It's a way to show support and honor their son. The term \"stolen valor\" usually applies to those who lie about their own service. Since the author isn't making false claims about themselves but are using items from their son, it's about supporting a family member. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They're not engaging in stolen valor because they aren't falsely representing their own service. The misunderstanding comes from the other person's interpretation, but the author's intent and corrections when asked suggest they're not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
