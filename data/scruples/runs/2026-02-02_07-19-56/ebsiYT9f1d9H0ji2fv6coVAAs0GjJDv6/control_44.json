I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. They have a son in the Navy and wear shirts, hats, and bumper stickers that mention the Navy. The main issue is when someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it's when someone falsely claims to have served in the military, especially in combat, to gain respect or recognition. The key here is false representation of service history.\n\nThe author clarifies they never served, but their son is in the Navy. They wear items given by their son, like squadron hats. The problem arises when people mistake them for a service member and the author corrects them each time. However, in the incident at the gun show, the man accused them of stolen valor for wearing the hat. The author then apologized and kept the hat on, which didn't cause more issues.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? The main points to consider are intent and misrepresentation. The author is wearing items related to their son's service, not their own. They correct people when thanked for their own service, so they don't seem to be intentionally deceiving. The items are from their son, which is a common practice among family members. However, the line might be blurred with the squadron-specific hat. Wearing a hat that's specific to a unit might imply personal connection or service, even if it's given by a family member.\n\nThe concept of stolen valor typically applies to individuals who lied about their own service. Since the author is not claiming to have served themselves, but are a parent of a service member, the line is a bit gray. Many military families wear related items to show support. However, some people might still take offense if it's perceived as misusing military symbols. The key here is intent. The author didn't lie about their own service, just didn't correct the person in a way that led to an argument. The fact that they have a history of correcting others but this time the person reacted more harshly might be a factor.\n\nBut does wearing the cap count as stolen valor? The cap from the squadron might be seen as more specific and could be considered a uniform item. However, since the author is a relative, there's a legitimate connection. The controversy might stem from the idea that military insignia should be reserved for those who have served. But in many cases, family members are allowed to wear certain items, especially if given by the service member. \n\nIn the end, it's about intent and whether the author misrepresented their service. Since they didn't claim to have served and corrected others when possible, they might not be in the wrong. The person who accused them might be overstepping, as the author's actions are supportive of their son's service rather than their own. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
