I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The key points from the story are:\n\n1. The author's son is in the Navy, and they proudly wear items like hats and shirts.\n2. They've been mistaken for a veteran before and corrected people, leading to appreciation for their son's service.\n3. Recently, at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron cap they never served in.\n4. The author hasn't served due to an injury but is proud of their son.\n\nFirst, I need to define what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it refers to falsely claiming military service or honors. The author isn't claiming they served; they're wearing items related to their son's service. However, the line might be blurry here. Wearing military gear without having served could be seen as appropriating symbols that belong to those who served, even if the intent is supportive.\n\nThe author does correct people when they're mistaken, which shows they aren't trying to deceive. Their motivation is pride in their son. But the key issue is whether wearing the squadron hat constitutes stolen valor. The person they spoke to at the gun show took offense, thinking the hat was a sign of the author's own service. The author didn't correct this immediately, leading to the confrontation.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If stolen valor is about falsely claiming service, and the author isn't making such claims, maybe they aren't at fault. However, the hat is tied to a specific squadron, which might require more context. Military families often wear such items as a sign of support, but some might see it as misusing the symbols. The answer depends on societal norms and the specific interpretation of stolen valor. \n\nLegally, stolen valor is a charge for falsely claiming military service, but in this case, the author isn't making false claims. They're wearing items associated with their son's service. Emotionally, the person who confronted them might feel that wearing such gear without service is disrespectful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the intent is purely supportive and they correct misinformation when it happens, maybe not. But the act of wearing a specific squadron hat could still be seen as misusing military symbols. The answer might be nuanced. However, based on the definitions, the author isn't making false claims, so they might not be in the wrong. The confrontation was due to a misunderstanding, and the author's actions are a form of family pride. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
