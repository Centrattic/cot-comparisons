I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent wearing Navy-themed merchandise, like a hat from their son's squadron, even though they haven't served. The key points here are the parent's intent and the context of their actions.\n\nFirst, the parent has a son in the Navy and is proud of him. They wear items that their son has given them, which include squadron hats. They correct people when mistaken for a veteran, so they're not pretending to have served. The issue arises when someone accuses them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing the specific squadron hat.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service to gain admiration or respect. In this case, the parent isn't claiming to have served; they clarify it's their son. However, the question is whether wearing the squadron hat without having been in the military is considered stolen valor. The parent's actions are more about showing family pride rather than pretending to have served. The key point is that they're not making false claims about their own service but are associating with their son's service.\n\nThe parent's intent is to support and show pride in their son, which is a common and understandable sentiment. Family members often display similar pride through symbols, like parents of athletes wearing team gear. The main difference here is the military aspect, but the intent is similar.\n\nHowever, some might argue that wearing specific squadron gear could be seen as appropriating military symbols without having the corresponding service. But since the parent is clear it's their son's service and they've corrected misunderstandings in the past, their intent isn't deceptive. The person at the gun show might have had a strict view on what's appropriate, but the parent isn't falsely claiming service.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't in the wrong because their actions are rooted in familial pride, not deception. They correct others when mistaken, and the items they wear are gifts from their son. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
