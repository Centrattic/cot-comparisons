I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The context is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they have items given by him. They've been corrected by people who thanked them for their service, and the author clarified it's their son. However, at a gun show, someone accused them of stolen valor.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. It refers to falsely claiming military service to gain respect or sympathy. The key here is intent. The author hasn't lied about their own service; they correct others when they're mistaken. They are wearing items given by their son, which is a point in their favor. \n\nThe author does mention they wanted to serve but couldn't due to an accident. This might be relevant to their intent. They're not impersonating a veteran but are showing pride in their son's service. However, the use of military insignia or squadron-specific gear might be where the issue lies. Even if the author is a parent, wearing squadron-specific items could be seen as appropriating military symbols that are meant to denote actual service.\n\nBut then, there's the nuance of family members. For example, spouses of service members often wear military-themed clothing, which is generally accepted. However, specific items like squadron hats might still be a problem if they're official military issue. If the hats are from the squadrons and not just generic Navy gear, the line might be crossed. The person who confronted the author might have felt that the squadron hat implies direct service.\n\nAlso, the definition of stolen valor can vary. Legally, in the US, there are laws against falsely claiming military service. However, wearing items that are given by a family member might not fall under that legal definition, especially if the intent is to show family pride, not to deceive. The key is whether the author is actively claiming service. They correct people when they're mistaken, so maybe that's enough to avoid the charge.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might be insensitive to those who served, but if their intention is genuine and they're not misleading people into thinking they served, then it's a gray area. The confrontation at the gun show is a conflict between the author's pride in their son and the other person's view of military symbols as exclusive to those who served.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as not in the wrong because they are correcting misunderstandings and the items are from their son. However, some might argue that wearing squadron-specific items is still problematic. But since the author isn't falsely claiming service and is in a supportive role as a parent, the answer could lean toward not being in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's a B (not in the wrong) because their intent is genuine, even if some people take offense.\n"
