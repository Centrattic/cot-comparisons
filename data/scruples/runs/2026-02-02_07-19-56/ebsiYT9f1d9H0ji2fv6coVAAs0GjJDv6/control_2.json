I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise even though they never served. The situation involves the author's son being in the Navy, and they have items like T-shirts, bumper stickers, and hats from their son's squadrons. They've corrected people who thanked them for their service before, explaining it's their son. But at a gun show, someone called them out for \"stolen valor\" for wearing the squadron hat, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"stolen valor\" means. It refers to falsely claiming military service or achievements to gain praise or recognition, which is illegal in some contexts. However, the key here is whether the author is claiming they served themselves.\n\nThe author explicitly states that when someone thanks them, they correct them and mention their son. So they're not actively lying about their own service. They are, however, wearing items associated with the Navy, which might lead some to assume they served. But the author's intent seems to be to show pride in their son's service, not to impersonate a veteran.\n\nThe legal aspect: Stolen valor laws typically apply to false claims of service. Wearing merchandise without serving is not illegal, unless it's part of a fraudulent claim. The author isn't using the hat or shirts to pose as a veteran, just to support their son.\n\nSocial norms might be different. Some people might find it inappropriate, but others understand that family members wear such items to show support. The key is whether the author misrepresented their own service. Since they clarify when asked, it's not intentional deception.\n\nThe man at the gun show got angry, but does that make the author wrong? The author didn't lie; they were wearing items gifted by their son. The conflict arises from a misunderstanding. The author's actions might be seen as respectful, given their pride in their son's service and their corrections when questioned.\n\nIn conclusion, while the man at the gun show had a valid concern about stolen valor, the author isn't intentionally deceiving anyone. They correct people when asked and their actions are in support of their son. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
