I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about someone wearing Navy-related items without having served. The key points are that their son is in the Navy, they've got hats and shirts from their son, and they've occasionally been mistaken for having served themselves. Now, they're being called out for \"stolen valor\" at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it's when someone lies about having military service or honors to gain respect or sympathy. But the author isn't exactly lying; they just wear the gear and correct people when mistaken. However, in the last incident, someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a specific squadron hat, which they didn't serve in.\n\nThe author's intention seems to be showing support for their son. They correct the assumption when people thank them for their service, so they're not pretending to have served. But the problem arises when someone else interprets their wearing of the squadron hat as implying service. The question is whether wearing such a hat without having served is inappropriate, even if the intent is support.\n\nNow, considering the context: the hats are given by their son, who is part of that squadron. So the hat is a family heirloom or a gift from a serving member. That might be different from just buying a navy shirt. But some might argue that wearing a specific unit's gear without having served there could be seen as misrepresentation, especially if the unit has a specific identity and achievements.\n\nThe person who accused the author might be sensitive because they see any non-veteran wearing unit-specific gear as disrespectful. Others might argue that showing support through family connections is acceptable. The key here is the intent versus the perception. The author's intent is support, not to claim service. However, the line between support and misrepresentation can be blurry.\n\nIn some cases, military families are encouraged to show support, so the author might not be in the wrong. However, the specific squadron hat could be a point of contention. If the hat is only worn by those who served in that unit, then wearing it without being part of it could be seen as appropriating their identity. But if the author is allowed to wear it as a family member, maybe it's okay.\n\nAlso, the author has a history of correcting people when they mistakenly assume they served. That shows they don't want to mislead. But in this case, the other person didn't check the facts, just assumed and reacted. So maybe the author isn't the asshole, but the situation is a bit of a gray area.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the specific squadron hat is considered off-limits to non-members. If the author is wearing general Navy gear, it's more about support. But a specific unit's hat might be different. Since the author's son is in that unit, maybe it's acceptable to wear it as a family member. However, the term \"stolen valor\" usually applies to false claims of service. The author isn't claiming to have served; they correct others when mistaken. So maybe they aren't in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
