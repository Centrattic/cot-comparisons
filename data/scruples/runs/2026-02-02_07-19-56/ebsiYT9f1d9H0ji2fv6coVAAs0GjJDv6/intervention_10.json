I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise despite never having served. The question is whether they committed \"stolen valor\" by wearing items like hats and T-shirts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's son is in the Navy, and the author wears items that celebrate their son's service. They have been corrected by others before but usually clarify that it's their son. However, in the recent incident, someone accused them of stolen valor, leading to an argument.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service to gain respect or other benefits. The key here is whether the author is falsely claiming to have served themselves. The author explicitly states they never served, but they are a parent of someone who did. They use items given by their son, which might be from specific squadrons. The issue is whether wearing squadron-specific items without having served is considered stolen valor.\n\nI recall that in some cases, using military insignia without authorization can be against regulations. The US Navy might have rules about the use of their emblems and squadron logos by civilians. If the hats and shirts have specific military insignia or squadron emblems, then the author might be violating those regulations, even if their intent is positive.\n\nOn the other hand, people often wear clothing that displays their support for family members in the military. The line is blurry here. The author is proud of their son and uses items that symbolize his service, which is understandable. But if the items are restricted to those who have served, then wearing them could be problematic. The author's previous corrections suggest they are clear that it's their son's service, but the recent encounter shows someone took offense because the author wore a squadron-specific hat.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author is not claiming personal service. 2) They are using items given by their son. 3) The items might have specific squadron insignias. 4) The person who confronted them accused stolen valor, implying the author is falsely representing their service.\n\nI need to check if wearing such items without having served is considered stolen valor. Legally, stolen valor is when someone lies about their own military service. The author isn't doing that. However, if the items are considered official military property or their use is restricted, then there might be a policy violation. The author might be unintentionally infringing on those policies, even if they mean well.\n\nSo, while the author isn't committing legal stolen valor, they might be violating military regulations regarding the use of insignia. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the regulations. If the items can be legally worn by civilians for supportive purposes, then they're not in the wrong. If the items are restricted, then they might be. The author's intent is to support their son, but the confrontation suggests that in some contexts, this might not be well-received.\n\nGiven that the author has been correcting others in the past, they are clear about their position. However, the specific squadron hat could be more contentious than general Navy support items. The answer here hinges on whether the specific squadron items are allowed for civilian use. If the author is using items that are meant for service members, then they might be in the wrong. Otherwise, if it's general support gear, they're not. Since the question is about being in the wrong in general, and the author's actions include using items from their son (which could be considered permitted if the son gives them), the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if the squadron hat is a restricted item, then A. The problem is that the story doesn't specify the legality of the items, but given the user's own thought that the author is in the wrong, but I need to make a judgment.\n\nIn the absence of clear regulations mentioned, the author's intent is to support their son and they clarify when asked. The confrontation might be an overreaction. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
