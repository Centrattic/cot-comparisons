I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The key points here are the definition of \"stolen valor\" and societal perceptions.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming or pretending to have received military honors or service that one hasn't. The author clarifies that their son is in the Navy and they wear items given by him, like hats from his squadrons. They also correct people who mistake them for having served, redirecting the thanks to their son. \n\nThe incident at the gun show where someone accused them of stolen valor is a point of contention. The author isn't claiming their own service but are wearing gear associated with the Navy through their son. The term \"stolen valor\" usually applies to individuals who lie about their own military service, especially for personal gain or recognition. In this case, the father is expressing pride in his son's service, not misrepresenting his own. \n\nHowever, the line can be blurry. Some might argue that wearing specific squadron gear could imply personal service, even if unintentional. But the author's actions\u2014correcting people and explaining their son's service\u2014show they don't intend to deceive. The key here is intent. Stolen valor requires intent to deceive. Since the author is clear about their son's service and the items are from their son, it's more about showing support rather than faking valor.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were medically unable to serve but wanted to. This adds context to their motivation, which is genuine support for their son and the Navy, not personal gain. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
