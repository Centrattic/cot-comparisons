I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served themselves. The person's son is in the Navy, and they have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. They usually correct people when thanked for their own service, redirecting it to their son. But at a gun show, someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat.\n\nSo, stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service. The person here isn't claiming they served; they're a parent of a serving son. They even correct people who thank them for their service. The issue is whether wearing the squadron hat is inappropriate. The person didn't serve, but the hat was given by their son. \n\nI think the key points are intent and the context. The person is clearly proud of their son's service and isn't pretending to be a military member themselves. They've even clarified their relationship to the son in past interactions. The accusation might stem from misunderstanding, as the squadron hat could be seen as a military identifier. However, since the person is a family member and the items were given by the son, it's a common practice for families to wear such items in support. \n\nBut maybe there's a line where using specific squadron identifiers could be seen as claiming affiliation. However, the person's main point is to support their son. The fact that they've corrected others in the past shows they don't want to mislead. The person didn't serve, but they aren't fabricating service; they're showing pride in a family member. \n\nSo, stolen valor is about falsely representing oneself as having served. Since the person isn't making that claim and has clarified their relationship, they might not be in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any policy against family members wearing specific military items. The US military allows family members to wear certain items, but maybe specific unit insignia? However, the person was given the hat by the son, so it's more of a personal memento. \n\nIn conclusion, the person isn't in the wrong because they're not falsely claiming service, just supporting their son. The answer should be B.\n"
