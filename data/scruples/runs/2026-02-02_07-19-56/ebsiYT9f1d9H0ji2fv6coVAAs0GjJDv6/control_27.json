I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person's son is in the Navy. They have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and squadron hats given by their son. They wear these items proudly. When people thank them for their service, they clarify it's their son. The conflict comes when someone accuses them of \"stolen valor\" at a gun show. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service for personal gain or recognition. Here, the person isn't claiming to have served themselves, right? They correct people when thanked, so they're being honest. The items are from their son, so they have a legitimate connection through family. The issue might be the perception versus the intent.\n\nThe key points are: honesty in correcting others, the items being gifts from their son, and the context of family pride. The person isn't lying about their service; they're celebrating their son's service. The accusation comes from someone else's interpretation, but the individual isn't fabricating a military background. \n\nIn most cases, wearing military-themed items as a family member isn't considered stolen valor if they're transparent. However, if the items are specific to units (like squadron hats), some might argue it's appropriating the unit's identity. But since the person is quick to clarify it's their son, the intent is clear. The main issue here is the other person's misunderstanding, not the wearer's intent. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they're honest about their son's service and the items are from their son.\n"
