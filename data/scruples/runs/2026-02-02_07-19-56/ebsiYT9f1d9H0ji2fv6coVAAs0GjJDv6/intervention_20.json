I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation involves the author's son being in the Navy, and the author having various Navy-themed gear, including a hat from the son's squadron.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is \"stolen valor.\" Stolen valor refers to falsely claiming to have served in the military, which is illegal. However, the author isn't claiming to have served themselves; they're clarifying that it's their son who serves. But when people mistakenly thank them for their service, the author corrects them. \n\nBut then there's the incident at the gun show where someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat. The author mentions they have other Navy gear and that their son has given them hats from different squadrons. The question is whether wearing a specific squadron's hat without having served in that unit is problematic.\n\nThe author has a legitimate connection through their son, so they are proud and wear the gear to show support. However, some people might take the wearing of a specific unit's insignia as implying personal service in that unit. The line between showing support for a family member and implying personal service might be blurry here. \n\nIn the past, the author has corrected people when thanked, which shows they're aware of the potential misunderstanding. But in this case, someone accused them of stolen valor. The key is whether the use of the squadron hat is misleading. If the hat is specific to a unit that the author never served in, then even if it's their son's, some might see it as inappropriate. However, others might argue that supporting a family member in the military is acceptable.\n\nLegally, stolen valor is about falsely claiming service. The author isn't claiming to have served in the military, just in the Navy. The problem arises if the gear is meant to deceive. Since the author is upfront when asked, maybe it's not intentional deception. But the squadron-specific gear could be seen as more specific than just general Navy support. \n\nIn terms of social acceptability, some people might find it offensive, even if unintended. The author's intent is to support their son, but the perception matters. If the person accusing them took offense, it's a social issue rather than a legal one. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. Legally, perhaps not, since they aren't falsely claiming service. Socially, some might feel they crossed a line by wearing a specific unit's gear. But the author's actions aren't malicious; they're showing support for their son. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is not falsely claiming military service themselves and is correcting others when needed. However, the specific squadron hat could be a gray area. But given the context and their openness, B seems right.\n"
