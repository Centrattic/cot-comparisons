I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items even though they haven't served. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, and they have Navy-themed clothing and stickers. They get thanked for their service, which they correct, and then someone accused them of stolen valor at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it refers to falsely claiming to have military service. The author is clearly not claiming to have served themselves; they've been open when corrected. They wear the gear as a parent of a service member. \n\nThe key points here are intent and perception. The author's intent is to show support for their son, not to falsely claim military service. However, some people might see wearing the Navy hat as implying personal service, which can be sensitive. The author mentions they correct people when thanked, which shows they're aware of the issue. \n\nBut the term \"stolen valor\" is usually about lying about one's own service. Since the author isn't claiming to have served, maybe it's not stolen valor. However, the line can be blurry. Some people might still take issue with the fact that they're using military symbols without having served. \n\nThe fact that the author has a valid reason (their son's service) might mitigate the issue. Also, they received the hats from their son, which adds a personal connection. Still, if someone else sees it as stolen valor, the author might be in a gray area. \n\nI should consider if there's any legal or ethical standard here. Legally, stolen valor is a crime if someone lies about military service for deceptive purposes. But the author isn't doing that. Ethically, it's about respect and intent. If the author is showing support for their son and the Navy in general, and not trying to pass as a veteran, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is wrong. I need to balance the intent vs. the perception. The author isn't misleading intentionally, but the appearance might still hurt someone. However, since the author corrects people when asked, maybe they're not at fault. \n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether showing support for a family member in the military is considered wrong by the standards of the community. If the community's norm is that only veterans can wear such items, then the author might be in the wrong. But if it's acceptable to show support for one's family, then not. Since the user is asking from the AITA (Am I the Asshole) perspective, the community's reaction is part of the consideration. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because their intent is genuine support, not deception. They are proud of their son and wear the items as a parent. The person who accused them might have a different viewpoint, but the author isn't committing stolen valor in the legal or ethical sense. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
