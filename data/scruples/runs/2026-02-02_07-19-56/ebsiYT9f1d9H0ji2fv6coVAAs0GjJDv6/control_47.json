I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not having served. The situation involves bumper stickers, T-shirts, hats from their son, and a confrontation at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming military service to gain sympathy or respect. The key here is whether the author is falsely claiming personal service. The author clarifies that their son is in the Navy and they're proud of him. They wear items given by their son, like hats from different squadrons. When people thank them, they correct it, explaining it's their son's service.\n\nThe main issue was at the gun show where someone accused them of stolen valor. The author didn't claim to have served but was wearing a squadron hat. The question is whether wearing such items without having served is wrong. The author has a legitimate connection through their son and the items are given by him. They don't fabricate their own service; they redirect the praise to their son.\n\nHowever, using the squadron hat might be seen as appropriating that specific unit's symbol without having served in it. But since the author is a parent of a serving member, some might argue it's a way to show support. The term \"stolen valor\" usually applies to claiming personal service, not supporting a family member. The author's intent is to show pride in their son, not to misrepresent themselves.\n\nThe fact that they corrected others when thanked suggests they don't want to mislead. The confrontation might stem from the other person's misunderstanding. The author isn't in the military, but their actions are in support of their son. Unless there's a rule against civilians wearing such gear, which the author isn't violating since they have the items from their son, they might not be in the wrong. However, some could still see it as insensitive to wear military insignia without service, even if the intent is supportive. But since the author is not claiming personal service and is redirecting the praise, it's more about intent versus perception. In the context of the community where military symbols are respected, the line might be thin, but the author's actions don't seem malicious. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
