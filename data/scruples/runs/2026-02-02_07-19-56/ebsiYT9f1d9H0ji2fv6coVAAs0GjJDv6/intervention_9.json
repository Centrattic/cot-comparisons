I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise despite not having served. The situation involves the author's son being in the Navy, and the author using items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. The key issue is whether this constitutes \"stolen valor,\" especially after someone called them out at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor typically involves falsely claiming to have served in the military or received military honors to gain respect or sympathy. It's about deception, not just wearing related items. \n\nThe author clarifies that they haven't served, but they are proud of their son and wear items that are associated with the Navy. They also mention that when people thank them for their service, they correct the mistake. The main conflict here is the confrontation at the gun show where someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat. \n\nThe author's intent here seems to be to show support for their son's service, not to impersonate a military member. They are not making false claims about their own service but are instead expressing pride in their child's service. However, wearing a specific squadron's hat might be more contentious than general Navy merchandise because it could imply a direct connection to that unit. \n\nThe question is whether wearing such items without having served is wrong. On one hand, it's their right to express support for the military. On the other hand, if the items are specific to a unit and could be seen as misrepresenting their own service, it might cross into problematic territory. However, since the author is clear about their son's service and corrects others when they make the mistake, it's not intentional deception. \n\nIn many cases, families of service members wear such items as a sign of support, similar to how families of law enforcement or firefighters might wear related merchandise. The line is blurry here. The key factor is intent and whether there's a misrepresentation. The author's actions are more about familial support rather than claiming personal service. \n\nThe person who confronted the author was upset, but the author didn't lie about their own service. They were corrected and apologized, which shows they're aware of the sensitivity. So while there might be some debate, the author isn't intentionally deceiving. Therefore, the answer might be that they're not in the wrong.\n"
