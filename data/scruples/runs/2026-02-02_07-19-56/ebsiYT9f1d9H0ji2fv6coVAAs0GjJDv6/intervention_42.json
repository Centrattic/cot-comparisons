I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite never serving. The author's son is in the Navy, and they have items like hats and T-shirts that their son gave them. They correct people when thanked for their own service, directing the gratitude to their son.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether wearing the squadron hat from their son constitutes \"stolen valor.\" Stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming or representing oneself as having served or achieved certain military honors. The author clarifies they have never served and corrects people when they're thanked. However, the problem arises when someone accuses them of stolen valor for wearing the squadron cap. \n\nThe author's defense is that they are a proud parent of a serving son and the hat was given by their son. But does that make it okay? The squadron cap might be specific to the unit their son is part of, and wearing it could be seen as implying some connection beyond just being a parent. Even if the author corrects people, the initial reaction from the person at the gun show suggests that the act of wearing the cap was perceived as misrepresentation. \n\nThere's a difference between showing pride in a family member's service and wearing unit-specific gear. Unit insignia often have a deep meaning to those who served there, and outsiders wearing them might be seen as appropriating that symbol without the associated experience. The author might not have intended to deceive, but the effect is there. The fact that the hat was given by the son doesn't necessarily negate the perception. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't claiming to have served themselves, just that they are a parent. The line is blurry here. Some might argue that supporting a family member's service is legitimate, but others might see unit-specific gear as crossing a line. The key is intent vs. perception. The author's intent is genuine, but the perception caused an issue. \n\nThe legal aspect of stolen valor usually involves false claims, but socially, the judgment is more about how others feel. The author's actions were not malicious, but the result was someone feeling they misrepresented. It's a gray area. However, in social terms, if wearing the squadron cap led to being called out for stolen valor, then perhaps the author is in the wrong, even unintentionally. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because wearing the specific squadron cap, even with good intentions, can be seen as misrepresenting their connection to the unit. They should have considered the potential for misinterpretation and perhaps chosen different ways to show support.\n"
