I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy merchandise without having served. The situation involves the author being thanked for their service, which they correct, and then getting confronted for \"stolen valor\" at a gun show.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. \"Stolen valor\" typically refers to falsely claiming military service to gain respect or sympathy. The author isn't claiming to have served themselves but is wearing Navy gear as a parent of a serving son. They correct people who thank them for their service, so they aren't pretending to be veterans.\n\nNext, the key issue is whether wearing items like hats and T-shirts from a squadron their son is part of is considered stolen valor. The author has a personal connection through their son, so they aren't using the Navy's symbols to falsely represent their own service. The items were given by the son, which might add to the justification.\n\nThe confrontation at the gun show seems to be the main conflict. The man accused the author of stolen valor, but the author's intent was to show pride in their son. However, some might argue that using military insignia without having served could be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent is positive. The line between showing family pride and misusing military symbols can be thin.\n\nThe author's history of wanting to serve but being unable to due to an accident adds context. They express pride in their son's service, which is genuine. The fact that they correct others' thanks for their own service shows they aren't trying to deceive. However, the hats and shirts might still be viewed by some as inauthentic use of military symbols.\n\nIn military culture, there's a strong emphasis on authenticity and respect for service. Wearing items related to a specific unit without having been part of it could be seen as crossing a line, especially if those items are reserved for members. The squadron hats might have specific significance that the author isn't part of, even if given by the son.\n\nBut then, families of service members often wear similar items to show support. It's a common practice, and many would see it as a way to honor the service member. The problem arises when someone is accused of stolen valor, which is a legal term and a social taboo. However, the author isn't making false claims beyond wearing the gear, just explaining their relation to a service member when asked.\n\nThe key here is intent. The author's intent is to express pride in their son, not to impersonate a veteran. The man who confronted them might be conflating the wearing of military items with false claims of service. Legally, stolen valor involves false claims of service, which the author isn't making. The hats and shirts are more of a symbolic gesture rather than a claim of personal service.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might take issue with the author's actions, the context of being a parent of a service member and their genuine correction when thanked for their own service suggests they aren't in the wrong. The confrontation might stem from a misunderstanding or differing opinions on the appropriate use of military symbols. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
