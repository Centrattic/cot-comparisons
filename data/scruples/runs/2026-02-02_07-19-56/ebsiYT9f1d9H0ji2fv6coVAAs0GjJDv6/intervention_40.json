I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The author's son is in the Navy, and they have items like hats and shirts. People have thanked them for their service, which they correct, redirecting to their son. But at a gun show, someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat.\n\nFirst, I need to define \"stolen valor.\" It's when someone falsely claims to have served or achieved certain military honors. The author isn't claiming to have served themselves; they're acknowledging their son's service. The items are gifts from their son, so they have a connection to actual service. However, the squadron hat might be more specific. If the hat represents a specific unit, does wearing it without serving there count as stolen valor? Maybe, but the intent here is important. The author is proud of their son and using the items to show support, not to falsely claim service. The man at the gun show reacted negatively, but the author's actions don't involve lying about their own service. They correct people when thanked, which shows they're not trying to mislead. The key difference here is that it's about parental support versus personal service. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not falsely claiming their own service; they're supporting their son's service through items he provided. The answer is B.\n"
