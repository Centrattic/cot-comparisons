I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing Navy merchandise without having served themselves. The situation involves their son being in the Navy, and they have items like a T-shirt and a hat from their son's squadron. When someone thanked them for their service, they corrected the person and mentioned their son. However, at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing the squadron hat.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong here? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely pretending to have served in the military or to have received military honors. The person in the story hasn't served, but they are wearing items related to their son's service. They correct people when they're mistaken about their own service. The key here is whether wearing the squadron hat is considered misrepresentation or if it's acceptable since it's related to their son's service.\n\nThe author clarifies that they have never served but their son has. They wear the Navy-themed clothing as a parent's pride. However, the specific issue was wearing the squadron hat, which is a specific unit. The person who confronted them accused them of stolen valor. But the author didn't claim to have served in that squadron; they just wore the hat. \n\nIn the previous instances where someone thanked them, they corrected the person and redirected it to their son. The problem this time was the specific squadron hat. The line might be that while wearing general Navy merchandise is okay (like a T-shirt saying \"Navy\"), wearing a hat from a specific squadron might imply personal service in that unit. However, the author got the hat from their son, so maybe it's a family memento. \n\nThe legal aspect of stolen valor usually involves lying about one's own service. Since the author is not claiming personal service but is instead showing support for their son, it's more about family pride rather than false representation. However, in public settings, wearing specific unit insignia without having served in that unit could be seen as appropriating the unit's identity. \n\nBut the author's intent is clear: they are proud of their son and want to show support. They corrected people when they were mistaken about their own service. The confrontation at the gun show happened because the person assumed the hat indicated the wearer was part of that squadron. The author's actions might be seen as misleading in that context, even if unintentional. \n\nHowever, there's a difference between general support (like a Navy T-shirt) and specific unit items. If the hat is from a squadron, maybe the community there is more sensitive about who wears their unit's gear. The author's son gave them the hat, so maybe it's a family keepsake. The author isn't pretending to be enlisted but is using items given by their son. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that it's disrespectful to wear unit-specific gear without having served in that unit. Others might say that family members can show pride through such items. The line between support and misrepresentation is blurry here. The author didn't lie about their own service, just didn't correct the assumption in that one instance, leading to the confrontation. \n\nThe key is whether the act of wearing the squadron hat constitutes \"stolen valor.\" If stolen valor is specifically about falsely claiming personal service, then the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't claim to serve. They corrected others when they thought they were mistaken. The problem was the misunderstanding when the person at the gun show assumed the hat meant the author had served. \n\nTherefore, the author's intention is to support their son, not to misrepresent themselves. The confrontation was due to a miscommunication. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They are not guilty of stolen valor because they didn't falsely claim personal service, just wore items associated with their son's service.\n"
