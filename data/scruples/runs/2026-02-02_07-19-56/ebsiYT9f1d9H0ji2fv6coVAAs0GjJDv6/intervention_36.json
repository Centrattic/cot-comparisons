I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation involves the author's son in the Navy, and they use Navy merchandise like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. People have sometimes thanked them for their service, but the author corrects them, explaining it's their son. At a recent event, someone called it \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat without serving.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of \"stolen valor.\" From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming to have served or received military honors. It's about deception, implying the person has served when they haven't. The key here is intent and whether the person is actively misrepresenting their service status.\n\nThe author is clear that they haven't served and corrects people when thanked. They wear items linked to their son, not pretending to have served themselves. The main issue is the squadron hat, which is specific to a unit. The person at the event accused them of stolen valor by wearing a unit's hat without being part of it.\n\nBut wait, the author is a parent of a Navy member. They're wearing items given by their son. The hats from different squadrons might be personal mementos, not necessarily indicating their own service. However, some might argue that wearing a unit-specific hat could imply association beyond just being a family member. The line between showing support and implying personal service might be blurry here.\n\nThe author's intent seems supportive, not deceptive. They've always clarified it's their son's service. However, the other person's reaction suggests that in some contexts, wearing such specific items might be seen as claiming service. But since the author has never falsely claimed their own service and corrects others, maybe they're not in the wrong. But could there be a public perception issue?\n\nThere's also the aspect of the hat being from the son's squadron. If the hat is unit-specific, maybe there's a protocol about who can wear it. Some military units have regulations about wearing their insignia. If the author is wearing a unit's hat without being a member, that could be against those rules. However, the author is a relative, so perhaps it's allowed. It's a gray area.\n\nIn terms of legal stolen valor, unless the author is lying about their service, which they aren't, it might not apply. But socially or within military culture, there might be sensitivities. The author's actions might be seen as crossing a line, even if unintentionally. However, the author's explanation shows they're not trying to deceive, just show support. The person who accused them might be overly sensitive or applying strict rules that others don't follow.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the key point is deception, then no. They are honest about their family member. However, if the issue is about appropriate use of unit-specific insignia, it's a matter of protocol. The answer might depend on context. Since the author isn't claiming service themselves and corrects others, they might not be in the wrong, but the situation highlights a possible misunderstanding. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because there's no intent to deceive, even if there's a cultural sensitivity.\n"
