I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not having served. The key points are:\n\n1. The author's son is in the Navy, and they have items like hats, T-shirts, and bumper stickers that mention Navy or their pride as a parent. \n2. People have occasionally mistaken the author for having served, leading to corrections where the author explains it's their son.\n3. At a recent event, someone accused the author of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in.\n4. The author clarifies they never served due to an accident in high school but have family members who did.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it's when someone falsely claims to have served in the military to gain respect or benefits. But here, the author isn't claiming to have served; they correct people when they make that mistake. They're wearing items related to their son's service, which is a common way people show support. The issue arises because the specific squadron hat might be seen as appropriation. However, the author has a legitimate connection through their son. \n\nThe guy at the gun show reacted negatively because the hat might be associated with a specific unit, and wearing it without having served there could be seen as misleading. But the author's intent seems to be pride in their son's service, not personal valor. \n\nLegally, \"stolen valor\" is a serious offense if someone lies about their service. However, in this case, the author isn't lying about their own service; they're wearing items gifted by their son. The main question is whether this is inappropriate. Some might argue that any military-related items without service are wrong, but others see it as a way to support service members. \n\nThe author's response to corrections is honest, and they wear these items out of genuine pride. The conflict comes from the specific squadron hat, which might have more specific symbolism. However, since the author has a family member in the military, some might view this as acceptable support. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a debate, the author's actions are driven by pride in their son and not by false claims. The key is intent versus perception. The answer likely hinges on whether wearing the son's squadron hat is seen as acceptable given the familial connection.\n"
