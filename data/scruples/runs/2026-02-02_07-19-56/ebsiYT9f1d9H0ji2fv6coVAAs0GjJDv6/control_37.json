I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent wearing Navy-related items and being called out for \"stolen valor.\" The parent's son is in the Navy, and they have items given by the son. The person hasn't served themselves but is proud of their son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it's when someone falsely claims they have military service or honors they didn't earn. But in this case, the person is clear that their service is their son's. They correct people when thanked for their own service. So maybe that's a key point.\n\nThe parent is wearing items from their son's squadrons. The problem arises when someone accuses them of stolen valor. The parent didn't lie about their own service but was corrected when thanked. But maybe the issue is about wearing the specific squadron cap. Some people might think that the cap implies the person served in that unit. However, the parent has a direct connection through their son.\n\nI should check if there's any regulation about wearing military apparel. I recall that the U.S. military allows veterans and active members to wear uniforms, but for others, there might be rules. However, the parent isn't wearing a uniform but merchandise like T-shirts and hats. The squadron hat given by the son is a specific item. If the son gave it, maybe that's a legitimate reason to wear it as a parent supporting a service member. \n\nThe person is clear about their son's service and corrects others when they thank them. The confrontation happened because the person assumed the parent was falsely claiming service. But the parent's intent is to support their son, not to impersonate a service member. \n\nStolen valor is more about falsely claiming one's own service. Since the parent is upfront about it being their son's, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, some might still argue that wearing military gear without any service is inappropriate. But the key here is the parent's transparency and the fact that they have a direct family member in service. \n\nIn the end, the parent's actions are about showing support for their son, not their own service. The confrontation was misunderstandings, but the parent isn't intentionally misrepresenting themselves when corrected. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
