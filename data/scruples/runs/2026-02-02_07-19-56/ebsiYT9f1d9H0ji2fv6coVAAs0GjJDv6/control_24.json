I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite never serving. The situation involves the author wearing items given by their son who is in the Navy and being called out for \"stolen valor.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming military service or honors. The key here is intent. If someone is deliberately impersonating a service member, that's different from wearing items related to a family member's service.\n\nThe author's case: They wear Navy-themed items because their son is in the Navy. They have corrected people when thanked for their own service. They have a legitimate reason for wearing the items\u2014they are a parent of a service member. The hats were given by their son from his squadrons. The person who confronted them might not have considered that context and assumed the author was falsely claiming service. \n\nBut the author isn't claiming to have served; they explain it's their son. However, the confrontation happened, and the person accused them of stolen valor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to think about whether wearing such items without having served is inappropriate. Some people might argue that military symbols are for those who served, but others might see it as a way to show support. Since the author is a parent of a service member, they might have a stronger claim to wearing the items as part of their family's pride. \n\nAlso, the author has a history of correcting people when mistaken for a veteran, which suggests they aren't trying to mislead. The confrontation at the gun show might have been a misunderstanding. The key points are intent and whether the author misrepresented themselves. If they never claimed to have served and corrected others when necessary, maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nHowever, the term \"stolen valor\" is a legal term sometimes used in cases where someone lies about their service. But in this case, the author isn't lying about their own service; they explain that it's their son. So perhaps the author isn't guilty of stolen valor. \n\nStill, there's a debate about whether non-veterans should wear military paraphernalia. Some people believe it's okay in this context, especially since it's a family member's items. Others might feel it's disrespectful. The answer depends on societal norms and the specific context.\n\nGiven that the author is a parent supporting their son and clarifies the situation when asked, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). The confrontation was a misunderstanding, and the author isn't falsifying their own service. The hats were from their son, so using them as a parent isn't stolen valor. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
