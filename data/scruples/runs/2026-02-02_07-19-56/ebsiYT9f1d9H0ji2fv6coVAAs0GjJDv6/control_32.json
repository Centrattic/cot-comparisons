I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wearing Navy merchandise without having served. The question is whether that's considered \"stolen valor\" or not.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to falsely claiming or representing oneself as having completed military service or received certain medals. It's when someone lies about their own service. But in this case, the author isn't claiming to have served. They explicitly correct people when thanked for their service and mention their son's service.\n\nThe author's son is in the Navy, and they wear hats and shirts given by their son. They wear them proudly as a parent. The key here is that the items are from the son's service. So, they're supporting their son and showing pride in his service, which is common among families. People often wear team shirts or school colors to show support, even if they aren't part of the team or school. So, is it different when it comes to military?\n\nThe user mentions that the Navy shwag includes squadron hats given by their son. That seems legitimate. The issue arose when someone accused them of stolen valor. But the author isn't falsely claiming their own service. They even correct people when they're thanked for their service. So maybe the problem is the perception. If someone sees the hat and assumes the wearer served, but the author isn't making that claim, just wearing items from their son.\n\nThe question is whether wearing the squadron hat without having served in that squadron is wrong. The author isn't part of the military, but they have a family member who is. The items are given as gifts, so maybe that's acceptable. There's a difference between wearing a team's merchandise and a military unit's gear. However, if the family member authorizes the use of such items (like giving them as gifts), then it's likely okay. The Navy allows family members to wear certain items, as part of supporting service members.\n\nThe key points are: the author isn't falsely claiming service, they correct others, and the items are from their son. The person who confronted them might have misunderstood, thinking the author was claiming service in that squadron. The author's intent is to show support for their son, which is a common and accepted practice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
