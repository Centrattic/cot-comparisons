I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise despite never having served. The situation involves the author's son being in the Navy, and they have items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats from their son's squadrons. When someone thanked them for their service, the author clarified it was their son. However, at a gun show, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they never served in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what \"stolen valor\" means. Stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service or medals to gain recognition or sympathy. The author isn't claiming they served but is wearing items associated with their son's service. The key point here is intent. The author corrected others when thanked for their own service, which shows they weren't trying to deceive. However, the use of specific squadron hats might be more contentious because those hats could represent specific units and might be seen as appropriating their symbols.\n\nThe author's family history includes other males serving, except themselves. They had a valid reason for not serving due to an accident. Their actions are motivated by pride in their son's service, not personal gain. The question is whether using military-related items, even from their son, crosses a line into stolen valor. \n\nIn the past, there have been legal cases where wearing military uniforms or medals without service is illegal. But in this case, the author is wearing items given by their son, not the uniform. The line between showing support and using symbols of service is blurry. If the hat is a specific unit's emblem, it might be seen as implying personal service in that unit. However, the author has been clear in most interactions that their service is their son's. \n\nThe confrontation at the gun show suggests that some people view this as inappropriate. The author's intention is pride in their son, but the effect on others might be seen as misusing military symbols. The question is whether the action, despite good intentions, is wrong. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't falsely claiming personal service in most cases, but the specific squadron hat might be a gray area. The answer hinges on whether the items used imply personal service. Since the author has a legitimate reason for not serving and the correction was made, maybe it's not stolen valor. But if the items are specific to units, it could be problematic. However, given the context of family pride and correction, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance here.\n"
