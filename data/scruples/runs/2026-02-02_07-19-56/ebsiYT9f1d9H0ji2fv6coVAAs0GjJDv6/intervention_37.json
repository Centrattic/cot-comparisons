I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wearing Navy merchandise despite not having served. The context is that the person's son is in the Navy, and they have items given by their son. They've been corrected by others before but it wasn't a big deal until the recent incident at a gun show where someone accused them of \"stolen valor.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, it's typically about falsely claiming military service to gain sympathy or respect. The key here is intent and the perception of others. The author clarifies they never served and have a medical reason preventing them, but they are a parent of a service member.\n\nThe author is wearing items given by their son, like hats from different squadrons. These are personal mementos from their child. The issue arises when someone at the gun show accuses them of stolen valor. The author corrected people before, but this time someone got aggressive.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider if wearing items from a family member's service counts as stolen valor. Since the author is a proud parent, it's a way to show support. However, some might argue that using specific squadron items could be misleading. But the author is clear about their son's service when corrected. The key point is that they didn't falsify their own service history; they were showing support for their son. \n\nIn legal terms, stolen valor usually involves false claims about one's own military service. The author isn't claiming they served, just that their son does. However, the line might be blurred if the items are specific to a unit, making it seem like the wearer has a direct connection. But since the author has a legitimate family connection (their son), it's a matter of interpretation. \n\nPublic opinion varies, but the author isn't intentionally deceiving. They corrected the person who thanked them. The other person's reaction might be based on a misunderstanding. The author's actions are supportive, not malicious. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (no), the author is not in the wrong. They are showing support for their son's service, and while some might be offended, the author's intent isn't to falsely claim military service for themselves.\n"
