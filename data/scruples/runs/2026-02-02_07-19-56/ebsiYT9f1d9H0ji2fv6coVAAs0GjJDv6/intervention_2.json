I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise without having served. The person's son is in the Navy, and they have items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. They've received thanks for their service before but corrected people, redirecting it to their son. At a recent event, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what \"stolen valor\" actually means. Stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming to have served or received military honors. The key here is whether the person is misrepresenting their service. The author is clear that they have never served and even explain why they couldn't. They wear items related to their son's service, not their own. They also correct people when thanked, so they're not intentionally deceiving. \n\nHowever, the issue arises with the squadron hat. The hat is from the son's squadron, which might be more specific than general Navy merchandise. The person who confronted them might have felt that wearing a unit-specific cap implies affiliation with that unit. But the author is wearing it because their son is in that unit, not because they served there themselves. \n\nI should also think about societal norms and sensitivity. While the author isn't lying about their own service, wearing unit-specific gear could be seen as appropriating the unit's identity. On the other hand, receiving such items from a family member is common, and the intent here is to show pride in their son. \n\nLegal aspects might come into play, but I don't think the question is about legality. It's more about right and wrong in social context. The author's actions are not deceptive since they clarify their status when thanked. The confrontation might have been an overreaction, but does that make the author wrong? \n\nI need to balance the author's intent versus the potential misunderstanding. The author isn't trying to pass themselves off as a veteran but is celebrating their son's service. However, the squadron hat might be more specific and could lead to assumptions. But the author's history of correcting people suggests they are transparent. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's room for debate, the author's actions don't constitute intentional deceit. They are using items given by their son to show pride, and they've been clear about their non-service. The confrontation was likely due to the other person's misunderstanding or strict view on the matter. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
