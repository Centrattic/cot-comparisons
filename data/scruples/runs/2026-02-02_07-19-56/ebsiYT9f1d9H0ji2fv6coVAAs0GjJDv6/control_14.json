I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise without having served. The key points here are about \"stolen valor\" and whether the author's actions cross a line.\n\nFirst, the author's son is in the Navy, and they wear items given by him, like hats and T-shirts. They've been thanked for their service before but corrected people, redirecting the thanks to their son. The issue came up at a gun show where someone accused the author of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in. The author apologizes and continues wearing it but feels conflicted.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to lying about having military service to gain respect or benefits. In this case, the author isn't claiming to have served themselves but are wearing items from their son. However, the line might be blurry. The problem could be that the hat from a specific squadron might imply personal service in that unit, even if the person didn't serve. The author is using their son's service as a connection, which is legitimate, but the specific squadron hat might be seen as taking that a step too far. \n\nThe author's intent is to show support for their son and the Navy, which is understandable. But the person who confronted them felt it was deceptive. The key is whether the author misrepresented themselves as having served in that specific unit. Since the author explains it's their son's, maybe it's not stolen valor, but the item itself might still be a point of contention. However, since the author is transparent when asked and the items are from their son, it's more about showing support rather than faking service. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
