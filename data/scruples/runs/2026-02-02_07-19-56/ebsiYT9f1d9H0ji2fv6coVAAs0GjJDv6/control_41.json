I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items despite not having served.\n\nFirst, the author's son is in the Navy, so the parent is showing pride in their child's service. They have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats given by their son. When people mistake them for a veteran, they correct them and redirect thanks to their son. The main issue is when someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" at a gun show.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is using items from their son, not claiming personal service. They correct others when thanked, so there's no intent to deceive. The term \"stolen valor\" typically refers to falsely claiming military service for personal gain or recognition. In this case, the author isn't claiming to have served; they're expressing pride in their son. The hats and stickers are gifts from their son, so they have a legitimate connection through their child's service.\n\nSome might argue that wearing squadron-specific items could be seen as appropriating the symbols, but since the author's son is part of that squadron, the items are a direct connection. The person who confronted them might not have considered that context. Also, the author's history of wanting to serve but being unable to due to an accident adds nuance\u2014this isn't about avoiding service but about supporting a family member.\n\nIn most cases, wearing military-themed clothing isn't prohibited unless it's to falsely claim service. The author's actions don't meet the definition of stolen valor because they're not pretending to be a veteran. The main issue was the confrontation, but the author isn't in the wrong for wearing the items as a parent of a service member. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
