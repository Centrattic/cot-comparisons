I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The situation is that the author's son is in the Navy, so they have bumper stickers, T-shirts, and a hat from the son's squadron. They corrected people when thanked for their own service before, but one person accused them of stolen valor.\n\nStolen valor is when someone lies about their military service for personal gain or attention, right? The key here is intent. The author hasn't served but is wearing items related to their son's service. They mention that when people thanked them, they corrected them and said it's their son. So they weren't pretending to have served themselves. The person who confronted them at the gun show was upset about the squadron hat, which the author had received from their son. \n\nThe author's actions are not about claiming their own service but celebrating their child's. However, the line might be blurry. Wearing a specific unit's hat could be seen as implying some connection, even if it's not direct service. But the author made it clear in the past that it's their son's service, not theirs. The confrontation happened despite that, but maybe the person at the gun show didn't know that context.\n\nThe definition of stolen valor usually involves false claims of personal service. Since the author isn't claiming to have served, just wearing items gifted by their son, maybe they aren't at fault. However, some might argue that using the squadron's cap could still be misleading. But the author's intent is positive, supporting their son, and they corrected others when appropriate. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because there's no intent to deceive about their own service. They are a proud parent, and the items are from their son. The person who accused them might have misunderstood the situation.\n"
