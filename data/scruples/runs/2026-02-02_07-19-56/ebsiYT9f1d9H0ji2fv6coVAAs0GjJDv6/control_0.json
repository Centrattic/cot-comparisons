I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole for wearing Navy merchandise when they haven't served. The situation involves the author's son being in the Navy, and the author has various items like bumper stickers, T-shirts, and hats from the son's squadrons. They get thanked by some people, which they correct, but then a guy at a gun show accuses them of stolen valor.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of \"stolen valor.\" Stolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming to have served in the military or receiving military honors one hasn't earned. The key here is whether the author is misrepresenting themselves as a service member. The author clarifies they never served and have family members who did, but due to an accident, they couldn't join. \n\nThe author is wearing items that are associated with the Navy, specifically a hat from their son's squadron. The issue arises when someone accuses them of stolen valor. The author is a parent of a serving member, so they have a legitimate connection through their son. However, the question is whether using Navy-related merchandise without having served makes them guilty of stolen valor.\n\nI should consider if wearing such items is acceptable. Military families often wear related gear to show support for their loved ones. The author is clear that they are a proud parent, not claiming their own service. The problem might be the misunderstanding of others. The term \"stolen valor\" usually applies when someone is pretending to have served, not when they are associated with a service member through family. \n\nHowever, using specific squadron hats might be seen as appropriating the specific unit's identity. Squadrons have their own identities, and wearing their hats could be seen as claiming affiliation with them. But the author received the hat from their son, so maybe that's a legitimate way to show support. \n\nThe key points are: the author isn't claiming their own service, they are a parent of a sailor, and they have items given by their son. The accusation from the man at the gun show might be based on a misunderstanding. The author's intention is to support their son, not to falsely claim service. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They are supporting their son's service and not making false claims about their own. The term \"stolen valor\" doesn't fit here because they aren't stealing valor from their own service. The man's reaction might be an overreaction, but the author's actions are within the bounds of showing family support. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
