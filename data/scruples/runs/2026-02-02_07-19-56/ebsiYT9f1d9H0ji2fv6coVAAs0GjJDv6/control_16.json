I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing Navy gear when they haven't served. The situation is that the person's son is in the Navy, and they have various items like hats and T-shirts. They correct people when thanked for their service, explaining it's their son. But at a gun show, someone accused them of stolen valor for wearing a squadron hat they never served in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stolen valor\" is. From what I know, it's when someone falsely claims to have served in the military to gain respect or admiration. The key here is whether the author misrepresented themselves as a veteran or someone who served. The author clarifies they have never served, mention their son, and correct people when thanked. They also have a history of injuries preventing them from serving. \n\nSo, the main issue is wearing the squadron hat. The author has a cap from their son's squadron, which might be specific military unit gear. The argument could be that even if they're not claiming to have served, wearing that specific cap might imply a personal connection beyond just having a family member in the service. \n\nBut the author has been clear when confronted, and the main problem is the one incident where someone accused them. The question is whether wearing such gear without having served is wrong. \n\nSome people might argue that supporting family members is valid and that the gear is a way to show support. Others might say that military insignia and specific squadron items are reserved for those who have served, and using them could be seen as disrespectful or misleading. \n\nThe author isn't claiming to have served themselves, but the hat could be confusing. The line between showing support and misrepresentation might be thin here. However, since they correct people when thanked and explain it's their son, maybe the intent isn't malicious. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the gun show, which is a place where many military enthusiasts and veterans might be present, the person's reaction could be more sensitive there. The author's actions might be seen as insensitive to those who value accurate representation of military service. \n\nBut the author isn't falsifying their own service, just showing support for their son. The key point is whether the specific squadron hat is considered a personal service item. If the hat is issued to the son and the author is wearing it as a family member, maybe it's acceptable. However, using a hat from a specific unit that the author never served in could be seen as using military symbols inappropriately. \n\nIn the end, it's a gray area. The author isn't lying about their own service but might be using items that are meant to denote active service. The answer could depend on whether wearing such items without having served is considered wrong, even with good intentions. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because their intentions are to support their son and they correct people when thanked. However, the specific squadron gear might be a point of contention. But since they're clear about their relationship to the service member, it's not stolen valor. Alternatively, if the hat is considered a personal service item, then maybe A. But I think the key is that they don't claim to have served, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
