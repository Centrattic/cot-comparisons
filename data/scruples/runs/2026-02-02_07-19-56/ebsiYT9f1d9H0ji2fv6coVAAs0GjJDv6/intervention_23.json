I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related merchandise despite not having served.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person has a son in the Navy and wears items like T-shirts, bumper stickers, and hats given by the son. They've been mistaken for a veteran before and corrected people. At a recent event, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in. The person is now questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nStolen valor typically refers to falsely claiming military service to gain sympathy or respect. The key here is whether the person is misrepresenting themselves. The author clarifies they are not a veteran, only their son is. They wear the items as a parent supporting their child's service. They have corrected people when mistaken before, which shows they don't intend to deceive.\n\nThe issue arises when someone accuses them of stolen valor. The person didn't claim to have served but was wearing a specific unit's hat. Some might argue that wearing unit-specific items could imply service in that unit, especially if the hat is clearly associated with a military squadron. However, the author's intent is to show support for their son, not to falsely represent their own service.\n\nLegally, stolen valor is a serious offense, typically involving lying about one's own service. In this case, the author is not lying about their own service history; they have been clear when asked. The problem might be more about perception. The person who confronted them might feel that using the squadron's emblem is inappropriate unless you've served in it. However, the author's son has served, so the items were given to them as part of his service.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a difference between general support (like wearing a Navy T-shirt) and wearing unit-specific gear. The general public might not see a difference, but within military circles, unit patches and squadron hats are specific identifiers of service. Wearing them without having served in that unit could be seen as inappropriate, even if it's to support a family member.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong legally or morally if their intent is genuine support for their son. However, the confrontation shows that some people have strong feelings about this. The key here is intent versus perception. The author's intent is clear, but the perception from others could lead to conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't intentionally deceiving anyone and their actions are motivated by pride in their son's service, there's a valid argument that using unit-specific items could be seen as inappropriate by some. However, since they haven't misrepresented their own service history and have corrected others when mistaken, it's debatable whether they're at fault. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent is genuine support, but there's a middle ground where they might need to be more mindful of the specific items they wear in certain contexts.\n"
