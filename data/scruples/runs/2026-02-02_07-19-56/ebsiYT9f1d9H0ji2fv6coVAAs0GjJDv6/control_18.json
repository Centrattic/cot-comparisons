I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wearing Navy-related items like hats and T-shirts even though they never served. The main issue is whether this counts as \"stolen valor\" or if it's acceptable given their son is in the Navy.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"stolen valor\" means. From what I know, stolen valor refers to someone falsely claiming to have served in the military to gain respect or recognition. So if someone lies about their own service to get praise, that's a problem. But in this case, the author is clarifying that the service they're connected to is their son's, not their own. That seems different.\n\nThe author mentions that they've corrected people who thanked them for their service before. When someone accused them of stolen valor, they apologized. So they didn't try to pretend they served; they made it clear it's their son. That might matter. \n\nThe key points here are intent and deception. If the author is wearing the Navy gear to show pride in their son and they're transparent when asked, does that count as stolen valor? The person who confronted them might have a different view, but the general public often supports showing family ties to service members. \n\nAlso, the family's history with military service (every male except the author) might add context. The author wanted to serve but couldn't due to an accident. Wearing the gear could be a way to honor their own family's sacrifices and their son's service. \n\nHowever, some people might still take issue with non-veterans wearing military insignia. But the line between respectful support and imitation can be blurry. The author isn't using the hats and shirts to claim personal service; they're celebrating their son's service. The confrontation happened because the other person assumed the author had served, but the author didn't correct them in that instance quickly enough. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are more about supporting their son and family pride rather than falsely claiming service. They've even clarified their status before, so the intent here isn't deceptive. Therefore, they're probably not in the wrong, even if some people disagree with the practice.\n"
