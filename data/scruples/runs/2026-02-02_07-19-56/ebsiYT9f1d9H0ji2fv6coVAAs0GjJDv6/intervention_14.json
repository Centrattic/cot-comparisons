I have bumper stickers on my truck that say \u2018proud navy dad\u2019 and T-shirt\u2019s that say similar things, or just \u2018Navy\u2019 and wear them often. I also have several navy hats that my son has given me from the different squadrons he\u2019s been assigned to over the years. I wear those too on occasion.\n\n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve occasionally had someone thank me for my service. When it\u2019s happens I\u2019ve always immediately corrected them and they\u2019d always say something like cool tell your son thank you for his service. No big deal right? \n\nLast weekend I walked through an average gun show/ swap meet with one of my son\u2019s squadron hats on. As I was tooling around a guy said thanks for your service. I said oh it\u2019s my son in the navy and started to brag on him when the guy went off on me for a few minutes saying how it was \u2018stolen valor\u2019 for me to wear the cap of a squadron that I never served in. I was pretty much shocked into blubbering some sort of apology and moved off. I kept the hat on the rest of my time there with no incidents. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for wearing navy shwag? Am I guilty of \u2018stolen valor\u2019 even if it\u2019s unintentional? \n\n(For the record, I have never served in the military. Every male in my immediate family has except me. I wanted to but an accident my last year of high school left me with multiple injuries that precluded military service. Yes I\u2019ve recovered since then.)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for wearing Navy-related items without having served. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author's son is in the Navy, and they wear items like T-shirts, bumper stickers, and hats given by their son. When people mistakenly thank them for their service, the author corrects them, explaining it's their son. But at a recent event, someone accused them of \"stolen valor\" for wearing a squadron hat they didn't serve in. The author is now questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is a parent of a serving son, they openly mention it when people thank them for their service, and they use items from their son. The person who confronted them called it stolen valor, which is the misuse of military symbols for personal gain or without having served.\n\nNow, I need to consider what \"stolen valor\" entails. It typically refers to falsely claiming military service or achievements for personal benefit. In this case, the author is wearing items that represent their son's service, not their own. However, the question is whether just wearing the squadron hat without having served is wrong.\n\nThe author is not claiming their own service when people thank them; they correct the misconception. But in the scenario where someone accuses them, the author is in a public setting with a specific squadron hat. The hat might be seen as a symbol of that specific unit, which the author hasn't served in. Even though they have a personal connection through their son, does the act of wearing the hat imply their own service?\n\nThere's a difference between general support items (like a \"Proud Navy Dad\" shirt) and specific unit items. The general support is likely okay, as it's showing support for the Navy. However, the squadron hat is more specific and might be associated with actual service in that unit. Wearing it could be confusing, especially if someone assumes the wearer is part of that unit.\n\nThe author's intention is to show support for their son's service, not to claim their own. They don't try to pass themselves off as having served. However, the accusation of stolen valor is about misrepresentation. Even if the author's intent is genuine support, the effect might be that it misleads people into thinking they served in that specific unit.\n\nBut then again, the hats were given by the son as mementos. It's a common practice for family members to keep such items, even if they don't wear them. Wearing them could be seen as a way to express pride in their son's service. However, the line is blurred because the squadron hat is a specific military unit's item, which might not be appropriate for someone not part of that unit.\n\nLegal aspects of stolen valor usually require intent to deceive. If the author is not trying to deceive and is open about it when asked, that might mitigate the issue. But the confrontation shows that some people take offense to it regardless of intent.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might not be malicious, but the specific use of squadron hats could be problematic. The general support items are okay, but the squadron-specific items might cross the line into misrepresentation. However, since the author corrects people when thanked, their intent is clear, which could argue against them being in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether the specific items imply personal service in that unit. Since the author isn't claiming their own service and has a legitimate connection through their son, they might not be in the wrong. But others might still see it as inappropriate.\n"
