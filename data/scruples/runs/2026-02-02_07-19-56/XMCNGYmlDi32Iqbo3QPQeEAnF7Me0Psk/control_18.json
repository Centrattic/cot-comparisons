I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They mentioned they were planning to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a pretty aggressive text, telling them to get up, get dressed, and threatening to pick them up. The author snapped back with \"Fuck off,\" which led to the sister-in-law being upset and the brother taking her side because she's pregnant.\n\nNow, considering the context: The author had already said no to the dinner, but the sister-in-law's response was harsh and disrespectful. The author felt disrespected, especially given past issues with the sister-in-law (insulting the mother on her birthday and badmouthing the parents on Facebook). The author's response was a strong one, but maybe they felt justified because of the sister-in-law's tone and previous behavior.\n\nBut wait, even if the sister-in-law was rude, responding with a curse like \"fuck off\" might not be the best approach. It's confrontational and could escalate the situation. The author's frustration is understandable, but using such a strong reply could be seen as disrespectful. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was also inappropriate\u2014telling someone how to behave and being condescending. \n\nThe author might feel they were being treated like a child, especially since they had already made their plans clear. The sister-in-law's message was overstepping by dictating the author's actions. Still, the author's response was a direct insult, which isn't helpful. \n\nPregnancy might be a factor the brother is considering, but that shouldn't override the sister-in-law's behavior. The author's point about the sister-in-law's past behavior adds context that might explain their anger. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The sister-in-law shouldn't have been so rude, but the author's response wasn't the healthiest way to handle it. However, considering the sister-in-law's tone and history, maybe the author's frustration is valid. \n\nBut in terms of the immediate action, telling someone to \"fuck off\" is pretty harsh. Even if the sister-in-law was being an asshole, the author's response could be seen as inconsiderate and adding fuel to the fire. So maybe the author is in the wrong for responding that way, even if the sister-in-law was being rude first. \n\nBut then again, if someone treats you disrespectfully, it's human to react. However, the proper approach would be to address it calmly. So perhaps the author is in the wrong because their response was inappropriate, even if the sister-in-law started it. It's important to manage the situation without escalating it further. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
