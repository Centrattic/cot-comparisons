I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister-in-law sending an aggressive text to the author, demanding they come to a birthday dinner, which the author had already declined. The author then responds with \"Fuck off,\" leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial actions. The author had politely declined the dinner invitation because they were tired from work and planned to attend the party the next day. That seems reasonable. The sister-in-law's response was pretty harsh and controlling, which the author found frustrating. The author's reply was a strong expletive, which is definitely rude. \n\nNow, the key points here are about respect and boundaries. The sister-in-law's message was disrespectful and condescending, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and treating the author like a child. The author's response, while justified in anger, was also disrespectful. The story mentions that the sister-in-law is pregnant, but the author feels that pregnancy doesn't grant the right to be rude. However, the author's own response was also a strong expletive, which is not respectful regardless of the provocation.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, which makes sense because while the sister-in-law was rude, the author's response was also inappropriate. The question is whether the author is the asshole. In these kinds of situations, even if provoked, responding with a curse like \"fuck off\" is generally seen as crossing a line. The sister-in-law's message was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction could escalate the conflict further. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions past issues with the sister-in-law insulting their parents, which adds context, but the immediate situation is about the birthday dinner. The author's decision to decline the dinner was valid, and the sister-in-law overstepped by demanding compliance. However, the author's response was also unkind. \n\nIn terms of social norms, using a strong expletive in a family text is usually frowned upon, even if provoked. So, while the sister-in-law was wrong to be so demanding, the author also made a mistake by responding with a curse. But since the question is specifically about the author's wrongness, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because their response was inappropriate, even if the provocation was bad. However, sometimes in these AITA scenarios, if someone is provoked unreasonably, their reaction can be seen as justified. But \"fuck off\" is pretty clear. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because their response was disrespectful, even if the sister-in-law's message was also rude. However, there's a nuance here where both parties acted poorly, but the question focuses on the author's actions. Hence, the author's response is the main issue here.\n"
