I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict between the author and their sister-in-law. \n\nFirst, the author declined a dinner invitation from their brother on his birthday because they were tired after work. They mentioned they were going to attend the party the next day. Then, the sister-in-law sent a text that was quite demanding and condescending, telling the author to get up, get dressed, and implying they weren't being respectful. The author's blood boiled, leading them to respond with \"fuck off.\" The sister-in-law then got angry, and the brother sided with her, citing her pregnancy. The author feels wronged because of past issues with the sister-in-law, like her insulting their mom.\n\nNow, evaluating who is at fault here. The sister-in-law's message was definitely over the top. Telling someone to \"get your ass up\" and not taking \"no\" for an answer in a disrespectful tone isn't appropriate. She's overstepping by dictating what the author should do, especially after they had already made plans. The author's response of \"fuck off\" is a strong reaction, but it's in response to a provocation. \n\nHowever, the author chose a very harsh reply. While the sister-in-law was rude, the author's response is also disrespectful. But considering the context\u2014the sister-in-law's message was condescending and dismissive of the author's boundaries\u2014it might be seen as a justified reaction, even if it's not the best way to handle it. The author might have been within their right to set a boundary, even if the method was abrasive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions past grievances where the sister-in-law insulted their mother. That adds context to their irritation. However, those past issues might have contributed to the author's heightened reaction. Still, the immediate issue is the sister-in-law's overbearing message.\n\nIn terms of social norms, being told how to behave in a demeaning way is unacceptable. So the sister-in-law is in the wrong for the initial message. The author's response, while not ideal, is a reaction to that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they were respecting their own needs and responded to a disrespectful message, some might argue they aren't the asshole. However, using a profane response could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a family setting.\n\nBut given that the sister-in-law's message was the catalyst, the author might not be entirely at fault. The key here is whether the author's response was a proportionate reaction to the sister-in-law's message. Since the sister-in-law was being disrespectful, the author might have a case for feeling justified. However, the response is still harsh. But considering the sister-in-law's tone, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the sister-in-law initiated the conflict with her message.\n"
