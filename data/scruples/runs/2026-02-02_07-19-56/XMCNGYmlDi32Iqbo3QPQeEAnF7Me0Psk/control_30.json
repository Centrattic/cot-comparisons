I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing a dinner invitation from their brother and then getting a harsh text from their sister-in-law, leading to a heated response.\n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner because they were tired after work. They mentioned they were going to the party the next day. The sister-in-law's response was pretty aggressive, telling them to get up and come, and not being rude. The author then replied with \"fuck off,\" leading to an argument. The brother took the sister-in-law's side, citing her pregnancy.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, refusing a social invitation isn't inherently wrong, especially when you have a valid reason like being tired. People have the right to set boundaries. However, responding with a curse word like \"fuck off\" is definitely rude and could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the provocation. The sister-in-law's message was harsh as well, but the author's response escalated the situation. Even if there's a history of issues with the sister-in-law, a direct insult isn't appropriate. The pregnancy angle is mentioned, but the author argues that being pregnant doesn't justify being disrespectful. However, the author's response was also disrespectful. So, the author might be in the wrong for responding with an insult, even if the sister-in-law was rude first. But maybe the sister-in-law overstepped as well. The key here is that while the sister-in-law's message was condescending, the author's response was equally inappropriate. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they escalated the conflict with a vulgar response, even if provoked.\n"
