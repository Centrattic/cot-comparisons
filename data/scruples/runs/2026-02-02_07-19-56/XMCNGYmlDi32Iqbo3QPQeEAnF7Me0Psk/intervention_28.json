I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict where the author told their sister-in-law to \"fuck off\" after receiving a demanding text message. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's brother had a birthday. The author declined an invitation to the dinner because they were tired after work but planned to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a text that was pretty insistent, even a bit condescending, telling the author to get up, get dressed, and be picked up. The author responded with a very rude message, which led to conflict. The sister-in-law is pregnant, which the brother used to dismiss the author's actions.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to hear my opinion. The main points to consider are the sister-in-law's tone, the author's right to set boundaries, and the context of past behavior. The sister-in-law's message was demanding and perhaps disrespectful, treating the author like a child. The author had already made plans to attend the next day's party, so declining the dinner was reasonable. However, responding with an expletive is a strong reaction. While the sister-in-law's message was inconsiderate, cursing someone, even if they're rude, can be seen as inconsiderate too. The author's past experiences with the sister-in-law insulting their mother might add context, but that doesn't justify the harsh response. The key is whether the author's response was proportional to the sister-in-law's message. The author's reply was disrespectful, even if provoked. So, while the sister-in-law was out of line, the author's response was also inappropriate. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault here. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
