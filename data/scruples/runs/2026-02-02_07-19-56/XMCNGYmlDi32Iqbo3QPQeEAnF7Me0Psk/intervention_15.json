I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a family conflict involving a sister-in-law. \n\nFirst, the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work but planned to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a demanding text, which the author found disrespectful. The author responded with \"Fuck off,\" leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, considering the key points here. The author had already agreed to attend the next day's party, so declining the initial dinner was a personal choice. The sister-in-law's message was quite harsh, using phrases like \"get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude,\" which could be seen as condescending. The author felt disrespected, given the sister-in-law's history of insulting their parents. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to curse at the sister-in-law, which is unkind and could escalate the conflict. Even if the sister-in-law was being rude, responding with a swear word might not be the best approach. The user also mentioned that the sister-in-law is pregnant, which might be a factor in how others perceive the situation, but that's a bit of a red herring here. The main issue is about mutual respect.\n\nThe brother sided with the sister-in-law, pointing out she's pregnant, but that doesn't excuse her behavior. The author's frustration is valid given the history, but reacting with \"fuck off\" is a poor choice. It's important to consider both sides: the sister-in-law overstepped by being condescending, but the author's response was equally disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author made a choice that was unprofessional and unkind. While they had valid reasons for feeling disrespected, the way they responded isn't acceptable. So, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because their response was inappropriate, even if the sister-in-law was being rude first.\n"
