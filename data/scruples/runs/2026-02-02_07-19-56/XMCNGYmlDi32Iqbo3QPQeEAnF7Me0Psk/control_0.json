I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author declining a dinner invitation for their brother's birthday because they were tired, planning to attend the party the next day. Then the sister-in-law sends a very pushy text telling them to come to the dinner, and the author responds with \"Fuck off.\" The sister-in-law is pregnant, which the brother brings up, saying the author is wrong because she's pregnant. Also, there's a history of the sister-in-law insulting the author's mother and talking bad about their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The author declined the dinner politely, maybe? They said they were tired and had another event the next day. Then the sister-in-law's message comes off as condescending, telling them what to do, even threatening to pick them up. The author's response is a harsh \"Fuck off,\" which is pretty rude. But the sister-in-law's message was also very demanding and disrespectful. The brother sides with his wife, citing her pregnancy as a reason. The author is upset because of past behavior of the sister-in-law towards their parents.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, responding with a curse word is definitely rude. Even if the sister-in-law was being disrespectful, a better approach might have been to stand up for themselves in a calmer, more respectful manner. However, the sister-in-law's message was also inappropriate. She's acting as if she's in charge of the author's schedule, which is not their place. The fact that the author has a history with her being disrespectful might contribute to their frustration. \n\nBut the question is about the author's action. They said \"Fuck off,\" which is a strong response. Even if the sister-in-law was wrong, the author's response is unkind and could be seen as the trigger for further conflict. The brother is taking his wife's side, maybe because she's pregnant, which adds another layer of complexity. However, pregnancy doesn't give someone the right to be rude or demanding. The author's response, while understandable in their anger, is not appropriate. So the author is in the wrong here because they escalated the situation with a harsh reply. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was also inconsiderate. But the question is about the author's actions. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response was disrespectful, even if provoked.\n"
