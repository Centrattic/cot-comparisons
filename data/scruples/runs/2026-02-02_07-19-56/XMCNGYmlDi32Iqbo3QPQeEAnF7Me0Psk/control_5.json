I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a family conflict. The user declined to attend their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired but planned to go to the party the next day. Their sister-in-law then sent a demanding text, which made the user angry enough to respond with \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user said no to the dinner but had a valid reason and a plan to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law's message was pretty aggressive, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"Don't be rude,\" which could be seen as condescending. The user's response was a curse, which is strong but might be a reaction to feeling disrespected. \n\nThe sister-in-law also has a history of insulting the user's mother, which adds context to the existing tension. The user mentions they don't have support from their brother, and he sided with his wife because she's pregnant. However, pregnancy doesn't grant immunity from being rude. \n\nNow, considering social norms, responding with a curse when insulted is a common reaction but not the most mature. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was clearly disrespectful. The user's right to set boundaries and decline invitations without being berated is important here. \n\nBut the user's response was a direct insult. Even if provoked, \"fuck off\" is a strong reply. The sister-in-law's message was overstepping, but the user's response might be seen as equally disrespectful. However, given the context of prior conflicts and the sister-in-law's tone, the user's frustration is understandable. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they did respond with a curse word, which is not ideal. However, they had been disrespected first. In many situations, if someone attacks you, a verbal response, though harsh, might be seen as a justified reaction. But in family matters, maintaining respect is usually advised. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user overreacted. If the sister-in-law's message was unkind and the user felt cornered, their reaction could be seen as a defensive move. However, using a swear word might escalate the conflict. Still, if the sister-in-law started it, the user might not be entirely at fault. \n\nConsidering all that, the user's initial refusal was reasonable. The sister-in-law's message was inappropriate. The user's response was a reaction to that aggression. While not the most diplomatic approach, given the provocation, maybe the user isn't entirely wrong. So, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here. However, in typical AITA scenarios, even if provoked, the best approach is to de-escalate. But the sister-in-law was wrong first. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me double-check. The user had the right to say no, the sister-in-law overstepped, user's response was an outburst but in response to being talked down to. So the user isn't in wrong. Answer B.\n"
