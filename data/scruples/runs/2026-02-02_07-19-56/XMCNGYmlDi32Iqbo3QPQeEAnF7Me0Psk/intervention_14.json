I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and their sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They had planned to attend the party the next day, which the brother and sister-in-law knew about. Then, the sister-in-law sends a very aggressive text, demanding the author come to the dinner despite their refusal. The author responds with \"Fuck off,\" leading to an argument. The sister-in-law is pregnant, and the author's brother sides with her, bringing up her pregnancy as a reason for the author's supposed wrongdoing. The author is upset because they feel the sister-in-law has been disrespectful to their parents before.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong here? Let's consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to decline the dinner they weren't obligated to attend. The sister-in-law's message was condescending and overbearing, using an authoritarian tone. The author's response was rude, but maybe the provocation was significant. However, using a curse word like \"fuck off\" is generally considered disrespectful, regardless of the situation. The sister-in-law's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's response was also inappropriate.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author had a legitimate reason to say no. 2) The sister-in-law's message was rude and presumptuous. 3) The author's response was also rude. 4) The brother's reaction adds another layer, but the main issue is between the author and sister-in-law.\n\nEven though the sister-in-law was in the wrong for sending a harsh message, the author's response was equally inappropriate. The argument could be made that the sister-in-law's behavior was worse, but the author's use of a curse word is still a social transgression. In most social contexts, responding to rudeness with rudeness doesn't make one right. The author could have chosen a different, more respectful way to set boundaries without using offensive language. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their response, even if the sister-in-law was also inconsiderate.\n"
