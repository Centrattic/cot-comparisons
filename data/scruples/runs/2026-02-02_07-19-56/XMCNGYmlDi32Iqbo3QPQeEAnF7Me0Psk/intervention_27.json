I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister-in-law sending a demanding text message, leading to a harsh response from the author.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author declined an invitation to their brother's birthday dinner, intending to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a message that was condescending and bossy, telling the author to get dressed and meet them. The author, upset, replied with \"Fuck off,\" leading to a conflict. The sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother took her side, citing her pregnancy as a reason. The author mentions past issues with the sister-in-law insulting their mom and Facebook comments, which adds to their frustration.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The sister-in-law's message was rude and disrespectful, acting like she's in charge. The author's response was an immediate \"Fuck off,\" which is clearly offensive. Even if the sister-in-law was being a jerk, reacting with such a strong profanity might be seen as over the line. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was also unkind, so there's some context here.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I need to consider if that's accurate. The key is whether the author's response was proportionate. While the sister-in-law was rude, the author's reply was also rude. In most social situations, even if someone is being a jerk, responding with a curse might not be the best approach. However, the sister-in-law's message was particularly condescending, so maybe there's some justification. But generally, using such strong language is considered inappropriate in family matters, especially when there's a pregnancy involved, which might be seen as complicating things further.\n\nAlso, the author had already declined the dinner invitation, so the sister-in-law's demand was out of line. The author had plans to attend the party the next day, which the sister-in-law was aware of. So the sister-in-law's message was unnecessary and controlling. However, the author's response was equally harsh. In terms of right and wrong, both acted inappropriately, but the sister-in-law started it. But in AITA scenarios, the focus is usually on the last action. The author sent the offensive message, which escalated the conflict. Therefore, the author might be considered the asshole for their response, even if provoked. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
