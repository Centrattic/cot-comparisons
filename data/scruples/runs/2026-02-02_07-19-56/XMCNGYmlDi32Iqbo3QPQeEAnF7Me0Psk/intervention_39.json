I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a family conflict involving a sister-in-law. The author declined a birthday dinner with their brother because they were tired, intending to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a demanding text, which the author responded to with \"fuck off.\" The author feels justified because the sister-in-law has been rude to their parents before and is pregnant, but they're upset that their brother is taking her side.\n\nFirst, the author did decline the dinner, which they had a right to do. However, the sister-in-law's message was harsh and disrespectful, which is a problem. The author's response was also harsh, using a curse word. Even if the sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, responding with \"fuck off\" is not productive. The author's frustration is understandable given past issues with the sister-in-law, but the response was still rude. The fact that the sister-in-law is pregnant might add some context, but it doesn't excuse her tone. However, the author also has a responsibility to communicate respectfully. Both parties acted inappropriately, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they used a disrespectful response, even if provoked, the answer might lean towards A. But some might argue it's mutual. Need to consider if the provocation justifies the response. In many cases, even if provoked, responding with cursing is seen as the wrong approach. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
