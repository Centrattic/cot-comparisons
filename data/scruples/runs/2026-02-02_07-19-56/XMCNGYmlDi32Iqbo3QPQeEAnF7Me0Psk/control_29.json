I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister-in-law to \"fuck off\" after she sent a demanding text message. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired but were going to a party the next day. The sister-in-law then texts them in a very authoritative tone, telling them to get up and join the dinner. The author, clearly upset, responds with \"Fuck off.\" \n\nNow, the sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother is defending her. The author also mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mom and posted negative comments about their parents.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider a few things. First, did the sister-in-law overstep? Her message was pretty harsh, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude,\" which can come off as condescending. The author had already declined the dinner and was attending a party the next day, so the sister-in-law's insistence might be unwarranted.\n\nHowever, the author's response was a curse word, which is rude. While the sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, responding with \"fuck off\" is also a disrespectful reply. The author had options to explain their decision calmly, but chose a harsh retort. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions past grievances, which might have contributed to their frustration. However, that doesn't justify the immediate response. Even if someone has been a difficult person before, reacting with a curse word can escalate the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister-in-law's message was definitely inconsiderate. She assumed the author was being rude by declining and didn't respect their stated plans. Her tone was bossy, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's response was also disrespectful. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was the first step in a cycle of disrespect. The sister-in-law's message was the initial provocation, but the author's reaction was also unkind. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone is being rude to you, responding with a curse might not be the best approach. It's about maintaining a level of decorum, especially in family situations. However, the sister-in-law's message was also very inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author did respond in a hurtful way. But their sister-in-law was also at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author chose to reply with an offensive phrase, even if provoked, they do share some responsibility. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong, because their response was disrespectful regardless of the provocation.\n"
