I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict between the author, their brother, and sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the brother invited the author to a birthday dinner, but the author declined because they were tired. They mentioned attending the party the next day, which the brother and sister-in-law knew. Then, the sister-in-law sent a harsh text demanding the author attend the dinner, which the author found offensive and responded with a \"fuck off\" message. The brother sided with his wife, even though she's pregnant, and the author feels wronged because of past insults towards their parents.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author declined a social event but had plans for another event the next day. The sister-in-law's message was condescending and possibly overstepping, leading the author to respond angrily. The author's defense is that the sister-in-law has a history of disrespecting their parents. The brother, however, blamed the author despite the sister-in-law's pregnancy.\n\nNow, considering social norms and family interactions. Usually, people are expected to be polite and respectful, even if they disagree. The sister-in-law's message was rude and authoritarian, which could justify the author's frustration. However, the author's response was also unkind and likely escalated the conflict. While the sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, the author's response was equally disrespectful. The author might feel justified due to past issues, but that doesn't make their response right. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties acted inappropriately. The sister-in-law shouldn't have sent a disrespectful message, and the author shouldn't have responded with a curse word. But since the question is specifically about the author's wrongness, the key is whether their response was justified. Even if provoked, responding with a \"fuck off\" is not the best approach. So maybe the author is partially at fault. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was the trigger. \n\nBut in many cases, even if someone else is rude first, you're still expected to respond calmly. So the author's action might be seen as in the wrong because they didn't handle it maturely. Alternatively, if the sister-in-law's message was extremely disrespectful, the author's reaction could be a result of built-up tension and past issues. The author mentions that the sister-in-law has insulted their mother before, which adds context. However, the immediate situation is about the birthday dinner. \n\nIn conclusion, while the sister-in-law's message was the catalyst, the author's response was also inappropriate. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether their reaction was reasonable given the provocation. In social standards, even when provoked, using a curse word is generally considered rude. So the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
