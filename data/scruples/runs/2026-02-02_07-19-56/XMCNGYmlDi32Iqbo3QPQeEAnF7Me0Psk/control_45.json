I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA poster) is in the wrong for telling their sister-in-law to fuck off after she sent a demanding text.\n\nFirst, the context: The author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work, planning to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a pushy message, treating the author like a child, which led the author to respond with \"Fuck off.\" The sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother is taking her side. The author also mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mother and talked about their parents on Facebook.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The sister-in-law's message was pretty harsh. She told the author to \"get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude,\" which sounds authoritarian. The author had valid reasons for declining\u2014being tired and already intending to attend the next day. The sister-in-law's tone seems to disregard the author's personal boundaries and previous plans. \n\nHowever, the author's response was a curse word, which can be seen as disrespectful regardless of the provocation. Even if the sister-in-law was inconsiderate, the author's reply might be seen as crossing the line. The sister-in-law's pregnancy might add context for her stress, but that doesn't justify her tone. The author's frustration with past behavior could also be a factor in their reaction, but responding with \"fuck off\" is still a strong reaction.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The sister-in-law's message was disrespectful, but the author's response was also disrespectful. The question is whether the author overreacted. While the sister-in-law's message was pushy, the author's reply is a direct insult. Depending on cultural norms, the severity of the response might be judged differently. In many cases, using a curse word in a family conversation is considered inappropriate, even if provoked.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's action was a disrespectful response to a disrespectful message. However, the sister-in-law's message was the initial provocation. The author might have a valid gripe, but their reaction is not justified. So, the answer might hinge on whether the author's response was proportionate. Since the sister-in-law was being dismissive and authoritarian, the author might feel justified, but in terms of right or wrong, the author's use of a curse word is still a problem. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong, but there's nuance.\n"
