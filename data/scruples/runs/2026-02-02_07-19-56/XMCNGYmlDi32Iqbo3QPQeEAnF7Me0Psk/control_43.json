I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author declining a dinner invitation for their brother's birthday because they were tired, then later being told by their sister-in-law they should attend, which led to a harsh response.\n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner request politely, explaining they were tired after work. They mentioned they would attend the party the next day, which the brother and sister-in-law knew about. So the initial refusal seems reasonable. The sister-in-law then sends a very demanding and disrespectful message, which the author finds infuriating. The author's response of \"fuck off\" is clearly angry, but the sister-in-law's tone was condescending and overbearing. \n\nThe sister-in-law's message is pretty aggressive. Using phrases like \"get your ass up,\" \"don't be rude,\" and implying that not attending the dinner is being rude to the brother. That's a lot of pressure, and the author felt disrespected. The author mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mom and talked about the parents on Facebook, which adds context to their irritation. However, the immediate issue is the sister-in-law's tone and the author's response.\n\nThe author's reply was a direct retort, which is unkind, but given the sister-in-law's tone, maybe the author felt cornered. However, responding with a curse word might escalate the situation. The brother then sides with the sister-in-law, bringing up her pregnancy as a reason, but the author argues that being pregnant doesn't justify her behavior. \n\nNow, considering etiquette and respect, the sister-in-law overstepped by being so demanding and disrespectful. The author had already made plans to attend the party the next day, so the sister-in-law's message was unnecessary. However, the author's response was also unkind. Even if provoked, a more constructive response would be better. But the sister-in-law's message was condescending and disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both parties acted inappropriately. The sister-in-law should not have spoken to the author in such a demeaning way. The author, while justified in feeling disrespected, could have responded in a more constructive manner instead of a curse. However, since the sister-in-law's message was the trigger, the author's anger is understandable. \n\nIn AITA questions, the key is whether the person did something that's widely considered wrong. The author's response was rude, but given the provocation, some might see it as a reasonable reaction. Others might say that they should have handled it better. But the sister-in-law's message was clearly in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe the author's response is still in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think in these cases, even if provoked, responding with a curse word is usually considered the asshole move. However, if the provocation was extreme, it might balance out. The sister-in-law's message was extreme, so the author's response might be seen as justified. But generally, the expectation is to maintain a respectful tone. So perhaps the author is in the wrong. Wait, but the sister-in-law was the one who was disrespectful first. So maybe the author isn't the asshole. I'm conflicted here. \n\nAnother angle: the author had already declined the dinner, and the sister-in-law was pressuring them further. The author's refusal was valid, so the sister-in-law's message was unwarranted. The author's response, while harsh, was a reaction to being talked down to. In that context, maybe the author is not in the wrong because the sister-in-law was the one being rude. So the answer is B.\n"
