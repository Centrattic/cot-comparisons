I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post was wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nSo, the situation is about the brother's birthday. The person declined the dinner invitation because they were tired after work, but they planned to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sends a very demanding text, telling them to get up and come to the dinner, which they found disrespectful. The person responds with \"fuck off,\" leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person had a valid reason for declining\u2014being tired after work. They communicated their plans to attend the next day's party, so there's no indication they were ignoring the birthday entirely. The sister-in-law's message comes off as controlling and unkind, especially given her history of insulting the person's mother and parents on Facebook. That adds to the tension.\n\nThe person's reaction was to send a harsh reply. While they were justified in feeling disrespected, responding with a vulgar message might not be the best approach. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was also inappropriate. The key here is whether the response was proportionate to the provocation. The person felt they were being treated like a child, and the sister-in-law's tone was aggressive. \n\nAlso, the sister-in-law is pregnant, but pregnancy doesn't grant the right to be disrespectful. The person's history with her previous behavior might have contributed to their frustration. The brother's reaction was to side with his wife, which didn't help.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister-in-law definitely overstepped by being condescending. The person's response, while not ideal, might be a reaction to ongoing issues. However, using a curse word might escalate the conflict. It's a gray area. But considering the sister-in-law's behavior and the context, the person might not be entirely wrong. But they could have handled it better without the harsh language. Still, the sister-in-law's actions were definitely in the wrong first. So maybe the person isn't entirely at fault here. But perhaps the answer leans towards AITA being the person because they did respond with a swear word. Hmm.\n"
