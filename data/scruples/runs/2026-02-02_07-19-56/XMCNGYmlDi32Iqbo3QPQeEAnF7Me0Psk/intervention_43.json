I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict.\n\nSo, the author declined to attend their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They mentioned they were going to the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a very aggressive text, telling them to get up and come to the dinner, using a tone that's condescending and even a bit rude. The author responds with \"Fuck off,\" which leads to an argument, especially since the sister-in-law is pregnant and the brother sides with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The sister-in-law's message was definitely harsh and disrespectful. She ordered the author to come, dismissed their reason for declining, and told them not to be rude. That's a lot of pressure and not a respectful way to handle the situation.\n\nThe author, feeling disrespected and probably angry, responds with a curse. While that's a strong reaction, it's a direct response to what they perceived as an insult. But is it justified? The sister-in-law was in the wrong by being condescending, but the author's reply was also rude. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate to the sister-in-law's message.\n\nThe backstory mentions that the sister-in-law has insulted the author's mother and posted negative things about the parents. This might add context to the author's irritation, but it doesn't necessarily justify a rude reply. However, in the heat of the moment, emotions can escalate quickly.\n\nNow, the author's brother is on the sister-in-law's side and mentions her pregnancy. The author feels unsupported. But the main question is about who is in the wrong in the specific incident. The sister-in-law's initial message was inappropriate and disrespectful. The author's response was also inappropriate, but it was a direct reaction to that disrespect. \n\nIn family dynamics, communication style matters. Using a curse word is certainly not the best way to respond, even if the other person was being rude. However, the sister-in-law's message was also not respectful. The author had the right to decline the dinner, and the sister-in-law had no right to berate them for it.\n\nSo, while both parties made mistakes, the sister-in-law's actions were more about asserting control and disrespecting the author's decision. The author's response was a knee-jerk reaction to that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering that they were disrespected first, the author's response, although rude, might be seen as a reaction to being treated poorly. However, the appropriate action would have been to stand firm on their decision without using a curse. So the author is partially at fault, but maybe not entirely. However, the question is a binary choice between A and B. Given that the sister-in-law was the initial aggressor, but the author's reply was also inappropriate, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they chose to respond rudely. Alternatively, since the sister-in-law was clearly in the wrong, the author might be justified. But in the context of the story, the author's actions are still problematic. So I think the answer is A.\n"
