I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired. They were supposed to attend the party the next day. Then the sister-in-law texts them in a very demanding and condescending way, telling them to get up and come to the dinner. The author responds with \"Fuck off,\" and then there's some fallout.\n\nFirst, the author did decline the dinner, which they had a reason for\u2014being tired after work. They also mentioned they were going to the party the next day, so maybe the sister-in-law didn't know that. The sister-in-law's message seems pretty aggressive, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"Don't be rude,\" which could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nBut the author responded with a curse word, which is pretty harsh. Even if the sister-in-law was being rude, responding with a vulgar message might escalate the conflict. The author also mentions that the sister-in-law has a history of being disrespectful towards their parents, which adds context about possible prior issues. However, the immediate situation here is about the birthday dinner.\n\nThe sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother is defending her by saying she's pregnant. The author argues that pregnancy isn't an excuse for being rude. While that's a valid point, the author's response was also rude. So, there's a mutual escalation here. The key question is whether the author's response was disproportionate. The sister-in-law's message was certainly condescending, but replying with a swear word might not be the best approach. Even if someone is in the wrong, responding with vulgarity can be seen as in the wrong as well. So, maybe the author is partially at fault here. But perhaps the sister-in-law started it. However, the user is asking specifically if the author is in the wrong. Since the author chose a harsh response, even if provoked, they might be at fault. So the answer might be A (yes), but I'm a bit conflicted because the sister-in-law was also rude. But in terms of right and wrong, both acted poorly, but the author's response is the main focus here. So probably A.\n"
