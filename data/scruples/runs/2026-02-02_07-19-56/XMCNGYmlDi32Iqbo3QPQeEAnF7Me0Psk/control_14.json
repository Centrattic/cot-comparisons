I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a family conflict. The user (the author) declined to attend their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work, intending to go the next day. The sister-in-law sent an aggressive text, and the author responded with \"fuck off.\" The sister-in-law got upset, and the brother supported her, mentioning she's pregnant. The author also mentions past issues with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author was wrong to respond that way. The sister-in-law's message was definitely harsh and condescending, treating the author like a child. The author had a valid reason to decline (being tired) and had communicated going to the party the next day. The sister-in-law's tone was disrespectful, which could justify frustration.\n\nHowever, the author's response was also a curse word, which is rude. Even if provoked, using such language might escalate the conflict. But considering the sister-in-law's initial message was also disrespectful, the author's reaction might be seen as a justified outburst. The key here is whether the response was proportionate. The sister-in-law's message was more aggressive in tone, so the author's reaction, while harsh, could be seen as a response to that.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the sister-in-law's past behavior toward their parents, which adds context to their irritation. The pregnancy might be a reason to expect some leniency, but that doesn't make the sister-in-law's message less inappropriate. The brother's reaction seems to side with the sister-in-law without considering the author's perspective.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's response was in reaction to a disrespectful message. While using a curse word isn't ideal, the sister-in-law's initial tone was also disrespectful. Therefore, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the author could have handled it better without swearing. But given the provocation, the answer might hinge on whether the response was proportionate. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that responding with a curse is not appropriate, regardless of the provocation. However, others might see it as a justified reaction to being treated rudely. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sister-in-law's message was the initial aggression, the author's response, while harsh, could be seen as a valid reaction. However, the author's use of a curse word is a negative point. \n\nI think the answer is more nuanced. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were responding to a disrespectful message, but their response was also inappropriate. However, the question is whether they're \"in the wrong,\" which might lean towards them being in the wrong because of the choice of words. Alternatively, the sister-in-law's initial message was worse. \n\nIn some contexts, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the sister-in-law's message was the problem. But others might say A because the author used a curse word. I need to check common perspectives. In similar situations, if someone is being treated rudely, a strong response is sometimes seen as justified. However, using explicit language is generally frowned upon. \n\nGiven that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the response was inappropriate, even if provoked. But considering the sister-in-law's message was also inappropriate, maybe it's a toss-up. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The sister-in-law's message was disrespectful, but the author's response was also disrespectful. Depending on cultural context, but in many cases, using a curse word is considered in the wrong. So maybe A.\n"
