I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is wrong for telling their sister-in-law to \"fuck off\" after receiving a demanding text.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author declined their brother's dinner invitation because they were tired from work, planning to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a text that was pretty pushy, ordering them to get up and come, and not being rude. The author responded with \"fuck off,\" which led to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author did decline the dinner, which they had a reason for (being tired). The sister-in-law's message was condescending and authoritarian. The author's response was a strong curse word. The sister-in-law is pregnant, but the author argues that pregnancy doesn't justify being a \"cunt.\" Also, there's prior issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mom.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and social norms. Insulting someone, even if they were rude first, is generally considered wrong. The sister-in-law's message was harsh, but responding with \"fuck off\" is a strong reaction. Even if you feel disrespected, using a curse word can escalate the situation. The author might have felt wronged, but their response is still offensive. Also, the author's brother sided with his wife, which might be adding to the frustration, but that doesn't justify the response.\n\nPrior interactions like the sister-in-law insulting the mother could explain the author's irritation, but that doesn't make the \"fuck off\" appropriate. People can manage their anger without using such language. The author might feel justified, but in terms of social expectations, responding with a strong curse is usually seen as the wrong move, even if provoked.\n\nSo, the author's action was a harsh reaction. They were in a position where they had already declined politely. The sister-in-law's message was rude, but the author's reply was even more so. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
