I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author declining a dinner invitation because they were tired, planning to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sends a demanding text, and the author responds with \"Fuck off.\" The author argues that the sister-in-law's tone was condescending and that there's a history of her being disrespectful to their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author did decline the dinner invitation politely, explaining they were tired. The sister-in-law's message seems harsh and controlling, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response, while harsh, might be a reaction to feeling belittled. However, using a profane response like \"Fuck off\" is definitely confrontational and could escalate tensions. \n\nEven if the sister-in-law's message was rude, responding with a curse might not be appropriate. The author could have handled it more calmly, maybe by explaining their stance again or setting boundaries without using offensive language. The fact that the sister-in-law is pregnant is mentioned, but the author argues that pregnancy doesn't justify the sister-in-law's behavior. However, that's not the main issue here. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction was justified. While the sister-in-law's message was indeed inappropriate, the author's response was also unkind. The author might feel wronged, but using a profane reply isn't the best approach. It's possible that the author is in the wrong for not choosing a more respectful response, even if provoked. So, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they used a harsh response that could have been avoided.\n"
