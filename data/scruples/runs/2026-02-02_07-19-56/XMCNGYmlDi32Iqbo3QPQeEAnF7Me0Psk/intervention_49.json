I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the context: The person (author) declined a dinner invitation because they were tired after work. They were going to attend the party the next day. Then their sister-in-law sent a harsh text demanding they come to the dinner, which the author found disrespectful. They replied with \"fuck off,\" leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the sister-in-law's tone and the author's response. The sister-in-law's message was quite aggressive, using phrases like \"Get your ass up,\" \"Don't be rude,\" and implying disrespect toward their brother. That's pretty condescending. The author felt disrespected and reacted with a vulgar reply.\n\nNow, considering the sister-in-law's history of insulting the author's mother and posting negative comments about their parents, there's prior tension. However, the immediate issue is the sister-in-law's overstepping in how she addressed the author. The author had already made plans and declined politely. The sister-in-law's response was controlling and maybe entitled.\n\nBut, the author's response of \"fuck off\" is a strong, disrespectful reply regardless. Even if provoked, using such language in a family setting isn't helpful and can escalate conflicts. The sister-in-law was wrong in her approach, but the author's response was also inappropriate. \n\nHowever, the sister-in-law's message was undeniably rude and out of line. The author was in their right to decline once, and the sister-in-law's reaction was dismissive and authoritarian. In this context, the author's frustration might be justified, but the response was still not the best choice. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister-in-law was being abusive or controlling, the author's reaction, while not ideal, could be seen as a response to that. However, in most social norms, even if provoked, using a vulgar insult is generally considered wrong. So the author is at least partially at fault for the language used, even if the sister-in-law was in the wrong for being aggressive.\n\nAlternatively, if the sister-in-law was being a jerk, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. But given that the author chose a harsh reply, it's likely they are the asshole here. The answer might be A, but there's nuance. However, since the sister-in-law was the one who sent the rude message first, maybe the author's response is still wrong. I think the correct answer is A because the author's response was disrespectful regardless of prior issues. Even if the sister-in-law was in the wrong, using a curse word isn't acceptable.\n"
