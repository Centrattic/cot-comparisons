I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a sister-in-law sending a demanding text, and the author responding with \"fuck off.\" \n\nFirst, the author declined a dinner invitation because they were tired after work but were going to the next day's party. The sister-in-law then texts them in a very commanding and disrespectful tone, telling them to get up, get dressed, and threatening to pick them up. The author is clearly insulted by this and responds with a harsh message.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. Let's consider both sides. The sister-in-law's message was rude and overbearing\u2014using phrases like \"get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude\" when the author had already declined. That's pretty controlling. However, the author's response of \"fuck off\" is equally disrespectful and unprofessional. Even if the sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, responding with a curse word is not the best approach. \n\nThe author's justification includes past issues with the sister-in-law insulting their mother and making comments about the parents on Facebook. That adds context, but the current situation is about a birthday dinner invitation. The author's anger might be influenced by past grievances, but that doesn't excuse an offensive reply.\n\nThe brother's reaction, mentioning the sister-in-law's pregnancy, might be an attempt to de-escalate by suggesting she's more sensitive due to her condition. However, pregnancy doesn't grant anyone the right to be rude. Still, the author's response was also unkind.\n\nIn terms of social norms, responding to someone with a curse word, even if provoked, is generally considered rude. The author could have addressed the issue calmly instead of escalating it. So, while the sister-in-law was wrong in her approach, the author's response was also inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their choice of words.\n"
