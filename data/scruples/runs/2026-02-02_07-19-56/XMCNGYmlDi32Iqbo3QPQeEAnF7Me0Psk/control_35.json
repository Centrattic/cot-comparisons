I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family conflict. The user (AITA) declined their brother's birthday dinner the day before because they were tired after work. They planned to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law sends a pretty aggressive text, demanding they come over. The user's blood boils and they respond with \"fuck off.\" Then the sister-in-law gets angry, and the brother sides with her, mentioning she's pregnant. The user feels wronged because the sister-in-law has a history of being disrespectful towards their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's actions. Declining the dinner invitation was polite, and they had a valid reason\u2014being tired. The sister-in-law's text was rude and controlling, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"Don't be rude.\" That's pretty harsh. The user's response was to say \"fuck off,\" which is definitely harsh, but maybe understandable given the provocation.\n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? Well, even though the sister-in-law was rude, responding with a curse word might escalate the conflict. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was disrespectful. The user might have felt disrespected and reacted emotionally. Also, the sister-in-law's behavior isn't justified by her pregnancy. The user mentions past issues where she insulted their mom and talked bad about their parents, which adds context.\n\nBut from an objective standpoint, even if provoked, responding with profanity isn't the best approach. It's possible the user overreacted. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was also inappropriate. The brother taking her side might not be fair, but that's another aspect.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the sister-in-law was being abusive, maybe the user's reaction is somewhat justified. But using a curse word is still a strong response. However, considering the sister-in-law's tone and the history, maybe the user isn't entirely wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how strict one is about language. But generally, even when provoked, responding with a curse might be seen as the wrong move. So leaning towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they escalated the conflict with a harsh response, even if the sister-in-law was also at fault.\n"
