I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister-in-law to \"fuck off\" after she sent a demanding text.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired, planning to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then texts them in a very aggressive and disrespectful manner, instructing them to come out despite their initial refusal. The author responds with a harsh \"fuck off,\" leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author's response was justified. Let's consider both sides. The sister-in-law's message was condescending and disrespectful, which could provoke someone. However, the author's response was also very rude and unkind. The sister-in-law being pregnant might add some context, but the user argues that pregnancy doesn't justify being treated poorly either. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had already declined the dinner, and the sister-in-law's message was overstepping, treating the author like a child. The author's frustration with past incidents (insulting the mother, Facebook comments) might have contributed to their reaction. But does that make the \"fuck off\" acceptable? Probably not. The author's response was aggressive and could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the provocation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, responding to someone's rudeness with even more rudeness isn't appropriate. The author had the option to express their frustration calmly, but instead chose a confrontational reply. Even if the sister-in-law was in the wrong, the author's response crosses a line. So, the conclusion is that the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
