I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by responding \"fuck off\" to their sister-in-law. The situation involves a family conflict around a birthday dinner.\n\nFirst, the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired, with plans to attend a party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a demanding text, which the author found disrespectful. The author's response was a harsh insult, leading to further conflict.\n\nConsidering the sister-in-law's message: she was instructing the author to attend the dinner, using a tone that the author found condescending. The sister-in-law's message included phrases like \"Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I don't even want to hear it. Don't be rude.\" This could be seen as overstepping, as it's not appropriate to command someone, especially a relative, in such a manner.\n\nHowever, the author's response of \"fuck off\" is a vulgar and aggressive reply. While the sister-in-law's message was rude, responding with a curse word might escalate the conflict. The appropriate response would be to stand one's ground but in a respectful manner, explaining that the decision to not attend the dinner was already made and that it's important to respect each other's boundaries.\n\nThe author's frustration seems to be compounded by past issues, like the sister-in-law insulting the mother and making Facebook comments. This history adds context, but it doesn't justify the harsh language. The key point is whether the author's response was proportionate. The sister-in-law's message was disrespectful, but responding with a curse word is also disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while both parties were rude, the author's response might be seen as more offensive because it was a direct verbal attack. The sister-in-law's message, while demanding, might be considered more of a breach of etiquette, whereas the author's reply is an outright insult. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because their response was unnecessarily aggressive and escalated the situation. Even if the sister-in-law was at fault for the initial message, a better approach would have been to communicate boundaries without using profanity. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
