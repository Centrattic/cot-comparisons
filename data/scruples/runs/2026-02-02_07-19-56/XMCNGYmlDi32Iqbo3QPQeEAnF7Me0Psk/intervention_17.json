I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict where the author told their sister-in-law to \"fuck off\" after she sent a demanding text about a birthday dinner. \n\nFirst, the author declined a dinner invitation because they were tired, but they were going to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a confrontational message, which the author found disrespectful. The author's response was \"fuck off,\" leading to further conflict. The sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother took her side, which added to the author's frustration.\n\nI need to consider the context. The sister-in-law's message was pretty aggressive, telling the author to \"get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude,\" which could be seen as overstepping. The author was already declined the invitation, so the sister-in-law's response might have been unwarranted. However, the author's reply was a harsh curse, which is generally considered disrespectful regardless of the provocation.\n\nThe key points here are mutual disrespect. The sister-in-law's tone was presumptuous, and the author's response was a direct insult. Even if the sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, responding with a curse is not the best approach. The author could have handled it more diplomatically, perhaps by explaining their stance calmly. The fact that the sister-in-law has a history of conflict with the author's parents might add context, but it doesn't justify the author's harsh reply. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while both parties acted disrespectfully, the author's use of a strong swear word is more likely to be seen as crossing the line. The sister-in-law's message was rude, but the author's response escalated the situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for responding with such a harsh insult, even if they felt provoked.\n"
