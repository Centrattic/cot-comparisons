I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family conflict. The user is the sister-in-law's brother-in-law. He declined a dinner invitation for his brother's birthday because he was tired from work but planned to attend the party the next day. Then his sister-in-law texts him in a very demanding and disrespectful way, telling him to get up, get dressed, and meet them in 30 minutes. She also says not to be rude and to have respect for his brother.\n\nThe user responded with \"Fuck off,\" which is pretty harsh. The sister-in-law got upset, and the brother took her side, mentioning she's pregnant. The user is frustrated because he feels she's been rude to his parents before, and now he's the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the user's response was appropriate. The sister-in-law's message was definitely condescending and overbearing. She didn't consider his initial refusal and treated him like a child. However, responding with a curse word, even if you're angry, is a strong reaction. It's possible that the user was justified in feeling disrespected, but using \"fuck off\" is aggressive and could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister-in-law's approach was also inappropriate. She shouldn't have demanded in such a bossy manner. The user's frustration might be valid given previous incidents with her, but that doesn't excuse a harsh response. The user might have handled it better by calmly explaining his stance instead of using a swear word. \n\nConsidering both sides, the sister-in-law's behavior was inconsiderate, but the user's response was also a poor choice. However, in terms of who is more at fault, the sister-in-law's initial message was more inconsiderate and condescending. The user's reaction, while not great, might be a justified outburst given the provocation. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the response was uncalled for. The sister-in-law's message was rude, but responding with a curse is still a strong reaction. So maybe the user is partially at fault, but perhaps not entirely. However, in typical AITA scenarios, aggressive language often leads to the person being called the asshole. The user's response is unprofessional and disrespectful regardless of the provocation. So maybe the answer is A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
