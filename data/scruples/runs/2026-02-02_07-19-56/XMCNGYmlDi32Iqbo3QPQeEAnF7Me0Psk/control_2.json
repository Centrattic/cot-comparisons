I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is wrong. The situation is about the author declining to attend their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They planned to go to the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a very bossy text, telling them to get up, dress, and come, and the author replied with \"fuck off.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author declined the dinner but was going to attend the next day. The sister-in-law's message might be seen as overstepping. It's important to note that the sister-in-law has a history of being disrespectful towards the author's parents, which adds context.\n\nThe author's response was \"fuck off,\" which is clearly rude. However, given the sister-in-law's tone, which was condescending and perhaps disrespectful, the author might have felt provoked. The sister-in-law also mentioned she's pregnant, but the author argues that pregnancy doesn't justify being treated rudely.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The author was within their right to decline the dinner, especially if they had a valid reason like being tired. However, their response was aggressive. On the other hand, the sister-in-law's message was also inappropriate, as she was ordering the author around instead of respecting their decision. The key points are about mutual respect and boundaries.\n\nThe author's sister-in-law's behavior seems to be the root issue here. The author's response, while rude, might be a reaction to being talked down to. But the author could have handled it differently, perhaps by explaining their stance without cursing. However, the sister-in-law's entitlement to dictate the author's actions is questionable. \n\nIn terms of social norms, responding with \"fuck off\" is definitely not polite. But if the sister-in-law was being disrespectful, the author might feel justified, albeit in the wrong. The history of the sister-in-law's behavior towards the author's parents also plays a role. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their response was inappropriate. However, the sister-in-law's behavior was also problematic. The question is whether the author's response makes them the asshole. Since the sister-in-law was the initial aggressor, but the author responded with swearing, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the author's response was still an escalation. But given the sister-in-law's tone and history, maybe the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nI think the right answer here is that the author is not entirely in the wrong (B), but they should have handled the situation more respectfully. However, the sister-in-law's behavior was also unacceptable. The key is that both acted in ways that could be considered rude, but the author's response was a direct reaction to the sister-in-law's condescension and history of disrespect.\n"
