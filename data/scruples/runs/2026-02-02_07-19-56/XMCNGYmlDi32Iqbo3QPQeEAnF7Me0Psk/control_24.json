I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and their sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the author declined their brother's invitation to a birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They had planned to attend the party the next day, which the brother and sister-in-law knew about. Then, the sister-in-law sent a harsh text demanding the author to attend the dinner, using an authoritative tone. The author responded with \"Fuck off,\" which led to further conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the sister-in-law's tone and the author's reaction. The sister-in-law's message was condescending and disrespectful, treating the author like a child. The author felt disrespected and responded with an insult. However, swearing at a family member, even if provoked, can be seen as inappropriate. The brother's reaction was to side with his wife, adding to the author's frustration. The author also mentions past issues with the sister-in-law, which might contribute to the tension.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The sister-in-law's message was likely the initial provocation, but the author's response was a direct insult. While the sister-in-law's tone was poor, the author's use of a swear word is also unkind and could be seen as crossing a line. However, given the sister-in-law's previous behavior mentioned (insulting the author's mother), there's context that might justify some frustration. \n\nIn terms of social norms, responding to disrespectful treatment with another insult isn't ideal. The author could have set boundaries without using a profane response. On the other hand, the sister-in-law's message was overly aggressive, which might mitigate the author's wrongdoing to some extent. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the sister-in-law's behavior justifies the author's response. While the sister-in-law was in the wrong first, the author's reaction is still problematic. However, given the provocation and past issues, it's a close call. In many cases, the person who initiates the conflict is the one in the wrong, but the response can also contribute. Here, the sister-in-law started it, but the author's reply was also inappropriate. However, since the sister-in-law was more aggressive and the author's response was a direct but one-time reaction, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But in most social contexts, the author's choice of words would be considered the wrong move, even if provoked. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance. Wait, but the sister-in-law's message was worse. The author was being respectful and had a valid reason to decline. The sister-in-law overstepped. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. This is tricky. Different people might have different views. If the sister-in-law was being disrespectful, the author might be justified in setting a boundary, but the method was poor. So perhaps the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the sister-in-law was the initial aggressor. But others might argue that the author should have handled it differently. Given the context, maybe the answer is B.\n"
