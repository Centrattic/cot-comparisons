I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They planned to attend the party the next day. Then the sister-in-law texts them, demanding they come to the dinner, and the author responds with \"fuck off.\" The sister-in-law gets upset and accuses the author of being rude.\n\nFirst, the author did decline the dinner invite. They were honest about being tired and had plans to attend the party the next day. That seems reasonable. The sister-in-law's message comes off as controlling and disrespectful. She's telling the author what to do, using a tone that's condescending, comparing them to a child. That's pretty harsh, especially since they were already planning to attend the follow-up party.\n\nThe author's response was to say \"fuck off,\" which is definitely a strong and rude reply. Even though the sister-in-law was being disrespectful, the author's response might be seen as overreacting. However, the sister-in-law had a history of insulting the author's mother and posting negative comments about their parents. That context is important because it shows a pattern of disrespect from her side.\n\nThe brother then sides with the sister-in-law, bringing up her pregnancy to imply the author should be more respectful. The pregnancy might be used as a shield here, but the author argues that being pregnant doesn't grant the right to be rude. \n\nSo, breaking it down: The author was within their right to decline the dinner. The sister-in-law overstepped by being condescending. However, the author's response was also rude. But considering the sister-in-law's previous behavior and the disrespectful tone of her message, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The sister-in-law definitely started it with her tone and message. The author's response was harsh, but maybe justified given the circumstances. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether their response was disproportionate. Some might say the author should have handled it more calmly, others might see it as a justified reaction. But I think the sister-in-law's initial message is more egregious. However, the author's response was unkind regardless. But given the context of past behavior, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. Hmm.\n"
