I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author declining to attend a dinner for their brother's birthday because they were tired. Then, the sister-in-law sends a confrontational text, and the author responds with \"Fuck off.\" Now, the user thinks the author is wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner but had plans to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law's message was pretty aggressive, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"Don't be rude,\" which could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response was a strong \"Fuck off,\" which is definitely harsh. \n\nBut there's context: the sister-in-law has a history of insulting the author's mother and badmouthing their parents on Facebook. The author feels disrespected and maybe provoked. The brother is defending the sister-in-law because she's pregnant, which adds another layer. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, responding with a curse word is unprofessional and could escalate the conflict. Even if the sister-in-law was being a jerk, the author's response was equally rude. However, the sister-in-law's tone was also inappropriate. But in terms of right and wrong, the author's choice to use such a strong insult might not be the best approach, even if they felt disrespected. The key point is that both sides contributed to the conflict. But since the user is asking if the author is wrong, the answer would be A (Yes) because using \"fuck off\" is typically considered disrespectful regardless of the provocation.\n"
