I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister-in-law to \"fuck off\" in a situation involving their brother's birthday. \n\nFirst, the author declined an invitation to the dinner because they were tired, but they planned to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a pushy text, using an authoritative tone and implying the author was being rude. The author snapped and replied with a harsh message.\n\nSo, the key points are: The author had a valid reason to decline, the sister-in-law's message was condescending and maybe overstepping, and the author's response was aggressive. \n\nNow, considering social norms, even if someone is upset, responding with \"fuck off\" is generally seen as rude. The sister-in-law's message was disrespectful too, but that doesn't justify a harsh reply. The author could have handled it more calmly, maybe by explaining their stance without being offensive. \n\nAlso, the context mentions past issues with the sister-in-law, but those don't absolve the author of responsibility for their own actions. Even if someone else is in the wrong, responding in kind escalates the conflict. \n\nSo, while the sister-in-law's message was problematic, the author's response was unkind and disrespectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
