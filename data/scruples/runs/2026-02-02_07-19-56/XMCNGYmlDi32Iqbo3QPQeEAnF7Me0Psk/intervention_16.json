I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday dinner. The author declined the dinner because they were tired but planned to attend the party the next day. Then the sister-in-law sent a very demanding message, which made the author snap and say \"fuck off.\" The sister-in-law was pregnant, and the brother took her side.\n\nFirst, the author's response was definitely harsh. Saying \"fuck off\" is pretty strong language and could be seen as disrespectful. But the sister-in-law's message was also pretty condescending. She told him to get up, get dressed, and even said not to be rude. That's not exactly a polite request. The author might have felt disrespected, especially since they had already planned to attend the next day. Plus, there's the background of previous issues with the sister-in-law, like insulting the mother.\n\nSo, while the author's response was rude, maybe the sister-in-law overstepped by being so demanding. The brother's reaction that the author is wrong because the sister-in-law is pregnant might not be fair either. Pregnancy doesn't grant the right to be disrespectful. The author did decline the dinner politely initially, so the sister-in-law's response was probably the main issue here. But still, responding with a curse word isn't the best way to handle it. The author could have explained their feelings better instead of lashing out. However, given the sister-in-law's tone and past behavior, maybe the author felt justified. It's a tough call. I think the author is partially at fault for the harsh response, but the sister-in-law's behavior also contributed. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A (yes), but maybe with some nuance. However, the typical AITA answer might lean towards A because of the offensive language used.\n"
