I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict where the author's sister-in-law sent a demanding text, and the author responded with a curse.\n\nFirst, the author declined the birthday dinner because they were tired. That's understandable. They mentioned attending the party the next day, so there's no issue with missing the dinner. The sister-in-law's message seems overbearing and disrespectful. She's telling the author what to do, even though they already had plans. \n\nThe author's response was \"Fuck off,\" which is definitely harsh. Even if the sister-in-law was rude, responding with a curse might escalate the conflict. However, the sister-in-law's message was also inconsiderate and possibly disrespectful. The context provided includes past issues with her insulting the author's mother and being dismissive. \n\nSo, while the sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, the author's response was also not the best. The key here is whether the author's reaction was justified. Even if they were upset, a more measured response might have been better. But given the sister-in-law's tone and history, maybe the author felt cornered. \n\nI think the author is partly at fault for not handling it more calmly, but the sister-in-law also has a lot to answer for. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because they didn't handle the situation with more maturity. But some might argue that the sister-in-law's behavior was worse. I'm a bit torn, but the direct question is about the author's actions. The response \"fuck off\" is inappropriate regardless, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
