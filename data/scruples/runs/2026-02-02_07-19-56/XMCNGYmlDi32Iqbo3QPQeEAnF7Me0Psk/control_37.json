I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a family conflict involving their sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired, but they planned to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a very harsh text, ordering them to come to the dinner, which the author found rude. The author replied with \"Fuck off,\" leading to further conflict. The sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother took her side, saying the author is wrong because she's pregnant. The author mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mom and posted negative things about their parents on Facebook.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author said no to an event but was going to another event the next day. The sister-in-law's response was aggressive and condescending. The author's reply was a strong swear word. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the sister-in-law's message was pretty demanding and disrespectful. Telling someone to \"get your ass up\" and not taking their refusal into account could be seen as overstepping. The author was already planning to attend another event, so the sister-in-law's reaction seems harsh. The past behavior of the sister-in-law adds context too; if she's had a history of being rude, that might explain the author's irritation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did say \"fuck off,\" which is a strong and offensive response. Even if provoked, using such a direct insult can escalate the situation. However, if the sister-in-law was indeed being disrespectful and the author felt attacked, their reaction might be a result of accumulated frustration. The author also mentions being a male, which might play into how the situation is perceived, but the key issue is about respect and communication.\n\nThe brother's reaction seems to be influenced by the sister's pregnancy, which might not be directly relevant to the argument. The author's point is that the sister-in-law's pregnancy shouldn't grant her the right to be treated a certain way, especially if she's been rude before.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister-in-law's initial message was inappropriate. She should have respected the author's decision without being confrontational. However, the author's response was also inappropriate. A better approach would be to calmly express their feelings instead of using a swear word. But considering the sister-in-law's history and the tone of her message, the author might feel that their reaction was justified, albeit poorly expressed.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the sister-in-law's message was so disrespectful that it warranted a strong response. Given the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their response was still unwise. However, the sister-in-law's behavior was definitely a significant factor. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the provocation was there, but the author's response was still harsh. However, the initial decline was valid, so the author isn't entirely at fault. The sister-in-law's behavior was more in the wrong here. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since they did say a swear word, maybe they are partially at fault, but not entirely. Hmm.\n"
