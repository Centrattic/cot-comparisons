I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling their sister-in-law to \"fuck off.\" Let's break down the details.\n\nSo, the author declined their brother's dinner invite because they were tired from work. They were going to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then texts them in a very demanding tone, telling them to get ready and go to the dinner. The author, already annoyed, responds with \"fuck off,\" which leads to an argument. The sister-in-law is pregnant, which the brother brings up to defend her. The author also mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mother and made comments on Facebook.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about respect and boundaries. The author had a valid reason to decline the dinner initially. However, the sister-in-law's message was condescending and disrespectful. The author's response was also harsh, but maybe they felt provoked. The sister-in-law's tone was aggressive, implying the author was being rude if they didn't comply. That kind of message can be seen as disrespectful itself.\n\nNow, the author's response of \"fuck off\" is certainly a strong and offensive reply. But considering the sister-in-law's message was similarly aggressive, the author might have felt attacked. However, the appropriateness of the response is in question. Swearing and using such language might escalate the conflict, even if the other person was being rude.\n\nAlso, the brother's reaction, bringing up the pregnancy, could be a red herring. The pregnancy doesn't excuse disrespectful behavior, and the brother's support for his wife might not be fair. The author's past experiences with the sister-in-law's insults could contribute to their frustration, but that doesn't justify a harsh response either.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while being assertive is okay, using profanity in a response can be seen as crossing a line, especially in a family setting. The sister-in-law's initial message was overbearing, but the author's reply was equally inappropriate. So both parties have some fault here. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nThe author had the right to say no to the dinner, but their response was not measured. A more appropriate reaction might have been to explain their stance calmly. Instead, they reacted emotionally, which led to a worse outcome. Even if provoked, using \"fuck off\" is likely to be seen as the author being in the wrong in a typical social context. The sister-in-law's message was rude, but that doesn't justify a similar level of aggression from the author.\n"
