I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a sibling-in-law sending a demanding text message, and the author responding with a curse.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author declined a dinner invitation from their brother because they were tired after work but planned to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then texts them in an aggressive tone, ordering them to come. The author responds with \"Fuck off,\" leading to a confrontation. The sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother sides with her, mentioning her pregnancy as a reason to be respectful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The sister-in-law's message is clearly disrespectful and condescending, treating the author as a child. That's a problem. However, the author's response is a curse word, which is also disrespectful. Even though the sister-in-law was being rude, responding with \"fuck off\" is a harsh and unkind reply. The author had the option to calmly explain their position or ignore the message instead of escalating with a vulgar response.\n\nAlso, the author mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mother and posted negative comments about their parents. This context might explain the frustration, but it doesn't justify a rude reply. The key question is whether the author's reaction was appropriate given the sister-in-law's tone. While the sister-in-law was in the wrong for being demanding, the author's response is still unkind and could have been handled more respectfully. So, the author is partly at fault for not responding in a more measured way, even if they were provoked.\n"
