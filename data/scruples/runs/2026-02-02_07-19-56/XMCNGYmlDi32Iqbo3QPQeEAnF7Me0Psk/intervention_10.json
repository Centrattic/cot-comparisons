I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They were planning to attend the party the next day. Then, the sister-in-law sent a really pushy text, telling them to get up, get dressed, and go out despite their refusal. The author then replied with \"Fuck off,\" which led to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had already declined the dinner, so the sister-in-law's message seems like overstepping. The author might have felt disrespected by the sister-in-law's tone, especially considering past issues with her, like insulting their mother. However, responding with a strong swear word like \"fuck off\" is aggressive and not the best way to handle the situation, even if they felt wronged. \n\nThe sister-in-law's message was definitely condescending and disrespectful. She's telling the author what to do in a very harsh manner, which could be a trigger for someone who already has tension. But the author's response was also unkind and could be seen as rude. Even if the sister-in-law was wrong, responding with a curse word might escalate things. The author could have handled it differently, like calmly explaining their stance or not engaging at all. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister-in-law is pregnant, which might make some people think she's being extra sensitive, but that's not an excuse for her behavior. However, the author's response doesn't take into account her possible stress from the pregnancy. \n\nConsidering all this, both parties have some fault. The sister-in-law overstepped, and the author responded in a way that's not helpful. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. While the sister-in-law was wrong in her approach, the author's response was also inappropriate. So, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong for how they replied, even if the sister-in-law was being unreasonable.\n"
