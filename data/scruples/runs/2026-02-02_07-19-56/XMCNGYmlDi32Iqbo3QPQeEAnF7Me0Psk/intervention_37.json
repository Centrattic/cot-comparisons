I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after telling their sister-in-law to \"fuck off.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The author declined their brother's dinner invitation because they were tired from work, planning to attend the birthday party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a demanding text, which the author found offensive. They responded with a curse, leading to an argument. The sister-in-law is pregnant, and there's prior tension with her having insulted the author's mother.\n\nThe key points here are about respecting boundaries and communication. The author chose to attend a different event, which they had already planned. The sister-in-law's message was aggressive and condescending, telling them what to do. The author's response was a strong swear word, which is definitely disrespectful. Even if the sister-in-law was rude, responding with a curse is likely to escalate the conflict and isn't a constructive way to handle it. \n\nAlso, the author mentions prior issues with the sister-in-law, which adds context but doesn't justify their response. While the sister-in-law's message was unkind, the author's reply was equally dismissive and potentially harsh, especially considering the pregnancy. However, the sister-in-law's message was the initial provocation. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if provoked, using a derogatory term like \"fuck off\" is not appropriate. The author had the option to explain their stance calmly, but instead chose to escalate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their response, despite the sister-in-law's initial tone. So the answer is A.\n"
