I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author declining a birthday dinner with their brother and sister-in-law due to being tired, then the sister-in-law sending an aggressive text, which led the author to reply with \"fuck off.\" The author is now being criticized by their brother and sister-in-law, and they mention past issues with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner invitation, which was their right. They had a valid reason (being tired after work) and had plans to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law's response, however, seems authoritarian and condescending. Telling someone to \"get your ass up\" and not allowing them to have their own reasons could be seen as disrespectful. The author felt disrespected and lashed out with a harsh reply. While the sister-in-law's message was rude, the author's response of \"fuck off\" is also a strong and disrespectful reply. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the sister-in-law acted inconsiderately, responding with profanity is not appropriate. The author could have expressed their frustration in a more constructive way. The fact that the sister-in-law was pregnant might be a factor others consider, but pregnancy doesn't justify disrespectful treatment. However, the author's past grievances might contribute to their anger. \n\nOn one hand, the sister-in-law overstepped by being authoritarian. On the other hand, the author's response was not measured. The key issue is that both parties acted inappropriately, but the author's direct question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the author chose to respond with a curse word, which escalated the conflict, they are likely at fault. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
