I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister-in-law being aggressive and the author responding with \"fuck off.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author declined the dinner invitation because they were tired after work. They were planning to attend the party the next day, which the brother and sister-in-law were aware of. Then the sister-in-law sends a harsh text, treating the author like a child. The author's reaction is to respond with a curse, and the sister-in-law is upset. The author also mentions past issues with the sister-in-law, like insults to their mother.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and boundaries. The sister-in-law's message was demanding and disrespectful, using phrases like \"get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude,\" which is condescending. The author was already polite in declining the dinner. However, responding with \"fuck off\" is also a disrespectful and aggressive reply. \n\nEven though the sister-in-law started it, the author's reaction is still not appropriate. It's a cycle of disrespect. The fact that the sister-in-law is pregnant might add some context, but that doesn't justify being a \"cunt,\" as the author put it. However, the author's response is still unkind and not a mature way to handle the situation. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's accurate. In most cases, even if someone else is at fault, responding with a swear word can escalate the conflict. The author could have chosen a more respectful way to set boundaries without being rude. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the sister-in-law was wrong to be aggressive, but the author's response was also wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they chose to respond with a curse, which is a clear transgression, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe some might argue that the sister-in-law's behavior justifies it. However, in general, using profanity is still not acceptable, so A makes sense.\n"
