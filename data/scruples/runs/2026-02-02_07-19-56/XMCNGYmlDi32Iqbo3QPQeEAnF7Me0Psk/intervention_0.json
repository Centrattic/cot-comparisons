I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister-in-law sending a very demanding and condescending text message. The author was already planning to attend the birthday party the next day and had declined the dinner because they were tired after work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister-in-law's message was pretty harsh, using phrases like \"Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes\" and \"Don't be rude. Have some respect.\" That's a lot of pressure and sounds patronizing. The author had already made a plan with their brother, so maybe the sister-in-law overstepped by trying to control the author's decisions.\n\nThen, the author responded with \"Fuck off.\" That's definitely a strong and rude reply. However, the sister-in-law's message was also inconsiderate and possibly disrespectful. The author had declined the dinner once, so receiving a pushy text might have been the last straw. The sister-in-law had a history of being disrespectful, according to the author, which adds to the tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. On one hand, using profanity and being disrespectful is generally not ideal, especially in family situations. It can escalate conflicts and cause more harm. On the other hand, the sister-in-law's message was extremely controlling and possibly crossed a line, making the author feel disrespected and infantilized.\n\nI think the key factors are mutual disrespect. The sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, and the author's response, while harsh, was a reaction to that. However, responding with a curse word is not the best way to handle it. The author could have addressed the issue calmly. So, while the sister-in-law was definitely in the wrong for her message, the author's response was also inappropriate. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The sister-in-law's behavior was unacceptable, but the author's response was also rude. So maybe the author is partially at fault. However, considering the sister-in-law's prior behavior and the fact that the author had a valid reason to decline the dinner, the author's frustration is understandable. Still, the choice of words was unkind. \n\nIn many \"Am I the Asshole?\" threads, responding with a curse word often makes you the asshole, as it can't be undone and escalates things. But the sister-in-law's message was also extremely out of line. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong, but there's nuance. The sister-in-law was definitely in the wrong for her message, but the author's response was also inappropriate. However, since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, and given that using \"fuck off\" is considered rude, the answer is likely A (Yes).\n"
