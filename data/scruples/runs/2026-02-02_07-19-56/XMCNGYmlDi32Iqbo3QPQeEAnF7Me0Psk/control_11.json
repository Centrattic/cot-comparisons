I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister-in-law sending a harsh text about attending a birthday dinner, and the author responding with \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner invitation because they were tired but planned to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent an aggressive message, which led to the author's angry reply. \n\nI need to consider the context. The sister-in-law's message was pretty demanding and condescending, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"Don't be rude.\" That kind of tone can be off-putting and disrespectful. The author might have felt disrespected, especially given past issues with the sister-in-law insulting their mother. \n\nHowever, responding with a curse word, even if provoked, is a strong reaction. The author's response was \"Fuck off,\" which is clearly offensive. Even if the sister-in-law was in the wrong, the author's reply is disrespectful and could escalate the conflict. \n\nThe author mentions their brother sided with the sister-in-law, pointing out she's pregnant. While pregnancy doesn't grant immunity from being disrespectful, it's a factor in how people might react. The author's frustration with past interactions adds context but doesn't justify the harsh response. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while the sister-in-law's message was rude, the author's response was equally uncivil. Both parties contributed to the conflict. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they escalated the situation with a curse word, even if provoked, they might be at fault. But considering the sister-in-law's initial aggression, there's a nuance. \n\nIn many cases, the act of responding with profanity is seen as the wrong move, regardless of the provocation. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their response was inappropriate. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to the sister-in-law's initial rudeness. However, the standard here is usually that using a curse word is the asshole move, regardless of context. So Answer A.\n"
