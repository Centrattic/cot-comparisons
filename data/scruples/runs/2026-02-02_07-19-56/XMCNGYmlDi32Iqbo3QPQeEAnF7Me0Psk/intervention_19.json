I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They were planning to attend the party the next day. Then the sister-in-law sent a harsh text, ordering them to get up and join them, and the author responded with \"fuck off.\" The sister-in-law was pregnant, and the author feels justified because the sister-in-law has a history of being disrespectful towards their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author declined a dinner invitation, which is their right. They had a valid reason\u2014being tired after work. They were going to attend the next day's party, so their absence wasn't complete. The sister-in-law's response was pretty aggressive, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude,\" which could be seen as condescending or overbearing. \n\nThe author's response was a curse word, which is definitely not polite. But the sister-in-law had a history of being disrespectful, so maybe the author felt justified. However, responding with \"fuck off\" is a strong reaction. Even if the sister-in-law was being rude, the author's response might have escalated the situation rather than addressing the issue calmly. \n\nAlso, the sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother took her side, arguing that her pregnancy gives her the right to be treated differently. But pregnancy doesn't inherently make someone's behavior acceptable. However, the author's response was also disrespectful, so maybe both sides have issues.\n\nThe key points are: the author had a valid reason to decline, the sister-in-law's approach was harsh, but the author's response was also inappropriate. The sister-in-law's past behavior might explain some of the irritation, but that doesn't make the author's response right. In terms of social norms, even if provoked, using such a strong expletive is generally considered rude. So, the author is probably in the wrong for their response, even if they felt wronged. The correct approach would be to address the sister-in-law's tone calmly and assert boundaries without using profanity.\n"
