I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a family conflict involving a sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired. They mentioned they had plans to attend the party the next day. Then the sister-in-law sent a harsh text demanding they come to the dinner. The author responded with \"fuck off,\" leading to an argument.\n\nI need to consider the context. The sister-in-law's message was pretty demanding and condescending, telling the author what to do. The author felt disrespected, especially given past issues with the sister-in-law. However, responding with a curse word is aggressive. \n\nBut the sister-in-law's tone was also disrespectful. The author had a valid reason to decline the dinner. The sister-in-law's message might have been overstepping. The author's reaction was a snap response in the heat of the moment. \n\nHowever, using a strong curse word like \"fuck off\" is not the best way to handle the situation. Even if provoked, the author could have responded calmly. The sister-in-law's message was rude, but the author's response is also rude. \n\nBut the sister-in-law has a history of being disrespectful to the author's parents, which adds context. The author might be justified in feeling irritated. However, the immediate response was still a harsh one. \n\nThe key points are mutual rudeness. The sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, but the author's response was also inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while the sister-in-law was wrong to speak like that, the author's response is still a direct insult. So technically, the author is at fault for the initial insult. However, considering the provocation, maybe it's a gray area. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether you prioritize the sister-in-law's initial disrespect or the author's response. Since the author was provoked but chose to respond with a curse, they might be in the wrong for escalating the situation. So answer A.\n"
