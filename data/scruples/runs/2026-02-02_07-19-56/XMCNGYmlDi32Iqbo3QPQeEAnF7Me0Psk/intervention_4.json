I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for telling their sister-in-law to fuck off. The situation involves their brother's birthday dinner. The author initially declined the dinner because they were tired but planned to attend the party the next day. Then the sister-in-law sent a demanding text, and the author responded with \"fuck off.\"\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respect and communication. The sister-in-law's message seems pretty confrontational\u2014telling someone to get dressed and be ready in 30 minutes, using an exclamation about not being rude. That's pretty harsh. The author was already planning to attend the party the next day, so maybe the sister-in-law's message was out of line.\n\nBut then the author responds with a curse word. Even though the sister-in-law was rude, using a swear word in return might escalate the conflict. The author mentions that the sister-in-law has a history of being disrespectful to their parents, which adds context. However, responding with \"fuck off\" is pretty strong. Even if someone is wrong, the way you respond matters. It's about mutual respect, right? So the author's response was probably not the best, even if the sister-in-law was being a jerk. The author might have been wrong to use such a harsh reply, even if they felt wronged. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
