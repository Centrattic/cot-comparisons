I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a family conflict involving their sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the author declined a dinner invitation because they were tired. They mentioned they were going to the party the next day. Then the sister-in-law sent a harsh text, basically ordering them to come to the dinner, which the author found offensive. In response, the author sent \"Fuck off,\" which led to an argument. The sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother took her side, saying that being pregnant gives her more right. The author also mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mom.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about respect and boundaries. The sister-in-law's message was quite demanding and disrespectful. Using phrases like \"Get your ass up,\" \"Get dressed,\" and talking down to the author like they're a child is aggressive. The author's response was to tell her to \"fuck off,\" which is a strong and disrespectful reply as well.\n\nThe author might feel justified because of the sister-in-law's tone and past behavior. But regardless of past issues, responding with a curse and disrespect isn't appropriate. Even if the sister-in-law was wrong, the author's response is equally confrontational. The fact that the sister-in-law is pregnant doesn't absolve her of being rude, but the author's reaction also crosses a line.\n\nFamily dynamics can be tricky. The author tried to decline politely, then faced a hostile reply. But reacting with a vulgar message is not the right approach. It escalates the conflict instead of resolving it. The author might have been stressed from work and tired, but the response was not measured. \n\nSo, while the sister-in-law's message was inconsiderate, the author's reply is also inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for responding with a curse and not handling the situation more calmly. Even if there's history of conflict, it's better to address issues with respect rather than reciprocating disrespect.\n"
