I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister-in-law sending a demanding text to the author, who then responds with a curse word. \n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner invitation because they were tired, which seems reasonable. They mentioned they were going to the party the next day, so there's no issue with their plans. The sister-in-law's message was pretty aggressive, using phrases like \"get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude,\" which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe author's response was \"fuck off,\" which is definitely harsh. Even though they felt disrespected first, using such a strong curse word might escalate the conflict. The sister-in-law is pregnant, which adds a layer, but the author argues that pregnancy doesn't justify being treated poorly. However, the author's response was equally rude, so the argument about the sister-in-law's behavior doesn't excuse their own.\n\nThe backstory about the sister-in-law insulting the mother adds context but doesn't justify the author's reaction. While past grievances are valid, retaliating with a harsh response isn't the healthiest approach. The author seems to have a lot of built-up frustration, but their immediate reaction was to insult, which isn't productive.\n\nConsidering all this, the sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, but the author's response was also in the wrong. Both parties acted disrespectfully. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they used a strong curse word and escalated the situation, they likely are at fault here. So the answer is A.\n"
