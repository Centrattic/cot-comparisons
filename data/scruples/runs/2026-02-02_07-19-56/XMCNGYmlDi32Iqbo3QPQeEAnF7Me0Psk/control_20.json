I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister-in-law sending a demanding text, and the author responding with \"Fuck off.\" \n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner invitation because they were tired, and they mentioned they were going to the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sends a very pushy message, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"Don't be rude.\" The author's response is \"Fuck off,\" which led to a confrontation.\n\nNow, considering the tone of the sister-in-law's message, it's pretty aggressive and condescending. She's treating the author like a child, which could justify frustration. However, the author's response is a strong swear word, which is definitely harsh. Even if provoked, using such a direct insult might be crossing a line.\n\nThe author also mentions past issues with the sister-in-law, like insulting their mom. That adds context to why they might be more irritable. However, the main question is about this specific incident. The sister-in-law overstepped by being demanding, but the author's response was also unkind. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone is rude to you, responding with a curse word can be seen as inappropriate, especially in a family setting. The author might feel wronged, but using \"fuck off\" isn't a constructive response. It's possible that a calmer reply would have been better, even if the sister-in-law was being unreasonable.\n\nThe brother's reaction supports the sister-in-law because she's pregnant, but pregnancy doesn't grant immunity from being disrespectful. However, the author's choice of words is still offensive. \n\nSo, while the sister-in-law was in the wrong for the initial message, the author's response is also inappropriate. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they did respond with a curse, that's likely the wrong move. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
