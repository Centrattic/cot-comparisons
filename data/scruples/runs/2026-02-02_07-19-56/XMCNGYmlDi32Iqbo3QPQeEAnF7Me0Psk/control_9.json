I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their brother's birthday. They declined the dinner because they were tired after work but planned to attend the party the next day. Then their sister-in-law sent a very pushy text, telling them to get up, get dressed, and come, and not be rude. The person got so angry they replied with \"fuck off.\" Now, they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They declined a dinner invitation, which they had the right to do. It's their choice to not attend, especially if they're tired. The sister-in-law's message seems very demanding and condescending. Using phrases like \"get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude\" might come off as disrespectful, especially since the person had already declined. The author's response was harsh, but maybe they felt disrespected.\n\nHowever, responding with a curse like \"fuck off\" is pretty strong. Even if the sister-in-law was inconsiderate, the author's reply is aggressive and could be seen as rude. There's also the fact that the sister-in-law is pregnant, which the author mentions, and their brother sides with her. But the author brings up past issues with the sister-in-law being mean to their mom and posting negative comments about the parents. That adds to the tension.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for their response. While the sister-in-law's message was probably inappropriate, the author's reply was also unkind. It's possible that the author should have handled the situation more calmly, even if they were upset. So, maybe the answer is A (they're in the wrong) because their response was inappropriate, even if the sister-in-law's message was pushy.\n"
