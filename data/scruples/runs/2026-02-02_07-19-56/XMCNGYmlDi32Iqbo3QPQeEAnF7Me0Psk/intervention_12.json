I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for telling their sister-in-law to fuck off. The situation involves declining a dinner invitation, receiving a pushy text message, and then responding with a curse.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author declined the dinner because they were tired after work, planning to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a demanding message, which the author found disrespectful. The author's response was to say \"fuck off,\" leading to a conflict. The sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother took her side, which the author seems resentful about. There's also a history of the sister-in-law insulting the author's mother.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect, and communication. The sister-in-law's message was overbearing, treating the author like a child, which the author found offensive. However, the author's response was a curse, which is harsh. Even though there's a history of issues with the sister-in-law, responding with a swear word might escalate the situation. \n\nThe author had the right to decline the dinner initially. But replying with \"fuck off\" could be seen as disrespectful. While the sister-in-law's message was inappropriate, the author's reaction might not be justified. It's possible that a better approach would have been to calmly explain their stance instead of using a curse. \n\nConsidering all that, the author made a mistake in their response, even if provoked. So the answer would be A, they're in the wrong.\n"
