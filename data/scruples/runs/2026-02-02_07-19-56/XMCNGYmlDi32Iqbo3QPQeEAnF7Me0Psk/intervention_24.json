I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who said \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong after telling their sister-in-law to \"fuck off.\" The situation involves declining a dinner invitation and then being told off by the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner with their brother because they were tired. They had plans to attend the birthday party the next day, which the brother and sister-in-law knew. Then the sister-in-law sent a demanding text, which the author found disrespectful. The author's response was \"Fuck off,\" leading to an argument. The sister-in-law is pregnant, which the brother uses as a reason to side with her. The author is upset because they feel the sister-in-law has a history of being rude to their parents.\n\nNow, considering the actions: Declining a dinner is a personal choice, and the author had a valid reason (being tired). However, the sister-in-law's message was condescending and possibly overbearing. The author's response was a curse word, which is a strong reaction. While the sister-in-law's tone was inappropriate, using a profane response might escalate the situation. The author's justification includes the sister-in-law's past behavior, but that doesn't necessarily make their response okay. The key points are mutual disrespect and the appropriateness of the response. The author's reply was harsh, even if provoked, so they might be in the wrong. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was also disrespectful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they used a curse word, which is a direct insult, they might be at fault. So, likely answer A.\n"
