I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister-in-law sending a demanding text and the author responding with a curse.\n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner because they were tired after work and planned to attend the party the next day. That seems reasonable. They had already communicated their plans to their brother, so maybe the sister-in-law overstepped by texting them again. \n\nThe sister-in-law's message was pretty aggressive. She told the author to get dressed and go out in 30 minutes, called them rude if they didn't, and implied a lack of respect. That's pretty harsh, especially without considering the author's prior commitment to attend the party the next day.\n\nThe author's response was \"fuck off,\" which is a strong reaction. But given the sister-in-law's tone, maybe the author felt disrespected. The sister-in-law had a history of being rude to their parents too, which adds context. However, responding with a curse might not be the best approach. Even if someone is inconsiderate, using a swear word could escalate the conflict.\n\nThe author mentions their brother is taking their side because the sister-in-law is pregnant. But pregnancy doesn't grant the right to be disrespectful. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of response could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nSo, the sister-in-law definitely overstepped, but the author's response was also unkind. It's a bit of a two-way situation. However, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the sister-in-law started it, but the author's reply was also not acceptable. The question is whether the author is the asshole. Since the author's response was a direct insult, even if provoked, they might be in the wrong for not handling it more calmly. But the sister-in-law's initial message was a major provocation. \n\nI think the key here is that while the sister-in-law was rude, the author's response was also inappropriate. However, the sister-in-law's actions were worse. But the question is specifically about the author. In terms of right and wrong, the author's response was uncivil, so they might be in the wrong for not responding more respectfully. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
