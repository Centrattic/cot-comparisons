I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict during a birthday event.\n\nFirst, the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They had plans to attend the party the next day, which their brother knew about. Then, the sister-in-law sent a demanding text, treating the author like a child. The author's response was \"fuck off,\" leading to a heated exchange.\n\nThe key points to consider: Did the author overreact? The sister-in-law's message was confrontational and disrespectful, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"Don't be rude.\" The author felt disrespected, especially given the sister-in-law's past behavior (insulting their mother, negative comments on Facebook). The author's response was a direct retort, which could be seen as inappropriate, but the sister-in-law's tone was aggressive.\n\nHowever, the author's reply with a curse word is a strong reaction. Even if provoked, responding with such language might escalate the conflict. The author's justification includes the sister-in-law's pregnancy, but that doesn't excuse disrespectful behavior. Family dynamics are complex, and while the sister-in-law's approach was poor, the author's response was also unkind.\n\nIn AITA cases, the focus is on actions and whether they were inconsiderate or wrong. The author's refusal to attend the dinner was their choice, but replying with \"fuck off\" is harsh. The sister-in-law's message was indeed inappropriate, but the author's response is still a problem. Both parties acted unkindly, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author used a vulgar response, even if provoked, it's likely they are in the wrong. But the sister-in-law's provocation is a mitigating factor. However, the standard in AITA is to evaluate the action taken. The author did respond with a curse, which is typically seen as wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
