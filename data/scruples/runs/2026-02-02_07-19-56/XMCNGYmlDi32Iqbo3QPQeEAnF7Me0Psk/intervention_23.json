I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author declining a dinner invitation for their brother's birthday because they were tired from work, planning to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sends a demanding text, and the author responds with \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author declined the dinner politely, explaining their reason. The sister-in-law's response was harsh and condescending, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's response was also a curse word, which is rude. But the sister-in-law's tone was already aggressive, which might have provoked the reaction.\n\nNext, the backstory mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted the author's mother and posted negative comments about the parents. This could add to the tension and make the author more defensive. However, even with that history, responding with a curse word is not the best approach.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The sister-in-law's message was indeed overbearing and disrespectful, which the author might have found offensive. However, the author's reply was also a direct insult. While the sister-in-law's tone was inappropriate, the author's response could be seen as escalating the conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had made their plans clear, and the sister-in-law's message was out of line. The author might feel they were being treated as a child, which is disrespectful. However, using a curse word is still not a mature way to handle it.\n\nConsidering all factors, the sister-in-law's message was rude and controlling, which is in the wrong. The author's response, while also rude, might be a reaction to that disrespect. But the author's choice of words was still inappropriate. So, there's a balance here. The sister-in-law started it, but the author's reply was also an issue. However, since the sister-in-law's behavior was the initial problem, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. But maybe the author could have responded differently. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nIn many cases, the person who is provoked might have a reason to be upset, but using profanity is still unwise. The sister-in-law's message was definitely inconsiderate and disrespectful. The author's response was a direct reaction, but it's still a poor choice. However, given the sister-in-law's tone, maybe the author's frustration is understandable. But in terms of right and wrong, both parties have issues. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they used a curse word, which is generally considered inappropriate, they are at least partially at fault. But if the sister-in-law was entirely in the wrong, maybe the author's response is excusable. However, in social norms, even if provoked, using such language is still considered wrong. So, the author is in the wrong for replying with \"fuck off,\" regardless of the sister-in-law's message. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
