I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired, planning to attend the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a harsh text telling them to come, and the author responded with \"fuck off.\" Now, the question is whether the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author declined the dinner request, which their brother knew about, and had a plan to attend the following day. The sister-in-law's message was pretty demanding, using phrases like \"get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude.\" The author felt disrespected and responded with a rude reply.\n\nNow, considering the sister-in-law's tone: she's pregnant, but that's mentioned more as context about her current situation. The author also mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mother and posted negative comments about the parents. That adds to the tension and possible resentment.\n\nThe author's response was a clear insult, which is a strong reaction. Even if they felt disrespected, responding with \"fuck off\" is aggressive and could be seen as the first escalation. However, the sister-in-law's message was also disrespectful, treating the author like a child. So who's at fault here?\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone is rude to you, it's natural to feel upset, but responding with equal or more aggression can make you equally at fault. The sister-in-law's demand for the author to attend a dinner they already declined, in a condescending way, might be the initial wrong. But the author's response was also inappropriate. \n\nConsidering that the author had already made plans known to their brother and was going to attend the next day, the sister-in-law overstepping by giving orders could be the issue. However, the author's choice of words was harsh. Even if the sister-in-law was wrong, the author's response is still unkind. \n\nSo, the answer might be a mix, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author used a curse word and was rude, even if provoked, it's likely they are in the wrong. The sister-in-law's message was rude too, but the author's response escalated things. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
