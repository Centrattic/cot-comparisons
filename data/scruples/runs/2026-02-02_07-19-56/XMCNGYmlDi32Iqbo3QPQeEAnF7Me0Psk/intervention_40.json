I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict where the author told their sister-in-law to \"fuck off\" after she sent a demanding text.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had already declined their brother's dinner invitation because they were tired after work, mentioning they'd attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a harsh message, telling them to get up and dress, implying they were being rude by not attending the dinner. The author's response was \"fuck off,\" which escalated the situation.\n\nNow, looking at the sister-in-law's message: it's pretty aggressive. She's using a lot of capital letters, which can come off as yelling. She tells the author not to be rude and to have respect, but her tone is demanding and condescending. She refers to the author as a child (\"Don't be rude\") and gives orders, which is disrespectful in itself. Also, the fact that she's pregnant might make her more sensitive, but that doesn't justify her behavior. However, the author's response was a curse word, which is certainly not respectful either.\n\nThe author mentions past issues with the sister-in-law insulting their mother and making negative comments about their parents on Facebook. This history of tension could contribute to the author's irritation. But even with that context, responding with a curse word is not appropriate, especially in a family setting where maintaining relationships is important.\n\nThe brother's reaction is also worth noting. He supported his wife and told the author they were wrong. This might indicate that the brother sees the sister-in-law's demands as valid, but again, the sister-in-law's tone was disrespectful. The fact that the author was planning to attend the next day's party shows they weren't completely ignoring the brother's birthday, which could be seen as a good intention.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the sister-in-law overstepped by being condescending and aggressive. The author responded in kind with a curse word, which was unprofessional and disrespectful. While the sister-in-law's message was indeed rude, the author's response was a direct escalation. In terms of right and wrong, both acted inappropriately, but the immediate question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author chose a disrespectful reply, even if provoked, they are in the wrong. The appropriate response would have been to calmly address the issue or not respond if needed, not to curse. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
