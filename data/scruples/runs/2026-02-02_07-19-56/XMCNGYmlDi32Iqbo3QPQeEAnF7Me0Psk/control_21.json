I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nSo, the author's brother had a birthday dinner, and the author declined to attend because they were tired from work. They were planning to come to the party the next day. Then, the sister-in-law sent a text that's pretty demanding, telling them to get up, dress, and go. The author responded with \"Fuck off,\" which led to a confrontation. The sister-in-law is pregnant, and the brother took her side, saying the author is wrong. The author mentions past issues with the sister-in-law insulting their mom and posting negative things about the parents on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author declined a dinner invitation but was going to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law's message seems overbearing and disrespectful, treating the author like a child. The author's response was very direct and rude. However, the sister-in-law's behavior has a pattern of being disrespectful to the author's family.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to respond with \"fuck off.\" On one hand, responding with a curse word is certainly rude and disrespectful, regardless of the provocation. On the other hand, the sister-in-law's initial message was also disrespectful, using commands like \"get your ass up\" and \"don't be rude,\" which could be seen as condescending and controlling. The author might have felt disrespected, especially with a history of the sister-in-law being insulting.\n\nBut in terms of social norms and general advice, even if someone is being rude, responding with a curse word is usually not considered appropriate. The author's response was escalated and could have been handled differently, such as explaining their position calmly or not responding at all. The sister-in-law's tone was bad, but that doesn't justify the author's response. However, the context of the sister-in-law's past behavior might mitigate some of the blame, as the author had valid grievances.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In most cases, using a curse word in a family setting is seen as the wrong action. The sister-in-law's message was poor, but the author's response is the direct action in question here. So, even if the sister-in-law was being an asshole, the author's response was also inappropriate. However, sometimes in AITA scenarios, if someone is being excessively rude, the other person's reaction might be understandable, but still technically wrong.\n\nSo, weighing it all, I think the author is in the wrong for responding with \"fuck off\" even though the sister-in-law was being rude. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
