I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a sibling-in-law getting angry over not attending the birthday dinner and responding with a rude message.\n\nFirst, the author declined the dinner invitation because they were tired and planned to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent an aggressive text, which made the author reply with \"Fuck off.\" The author feels justified because of past grievances with the sister-in-law, but the family is taking the sister-in-law's side due to her pregnancy.\n\nI need to determine if the author's response was wrong. While the sister-in-law's message was certainly rude and condescending, using a profane reply like \"fuck off\" is also disrespectful. The author had the right to decline the dinner, but responding with such a strong curse might escalate the situation unnecessarily. Even if there's a history of issues, the immediate reaction can be seen as inappropriate. The context of the sister-in-law being pregnant might influence perceptions, but it's not a valid reason to be rude. However, the author's response was still unkind and could be seen as the wrong approach. So, balancing both sides, the author is probably in the wrong here.\n"
