I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their sister-in-law to \"fuck off\" after receiving a demanding text.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author declined their brother's dinner invitation because they were tired after work, planning to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a harsh text telling them to get up and come to the dinner, threatening to pick them up. The author responded with \"fuck off,\" leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister-in-law's tone and the author's response. The sister-in-law's message was pretty aggressive and disrespectful, using phrases like \"Get your ass up,\" \"don't be rude,\" and implying the author should attend. That's pretty demanding and possibly overstepping. The author felt disrespected, especially considering past issues with the sister-in-law insulting their mother.\n\nBut the author's response was to send a vulgar message. Even though the sister-in-law was rude, responding with a curse can escalate things. The question is whether the author's response was proportionate. Even if someone is being disrespectful, is it ever okay to respond with a swear? It might be seen as unprofessional or immature, depending on the context. However, the sister-in-law's behavior could justify the author's frustration.\n\nAlso, considering the sister-in-law is pregnant, some might argue she's more sensitive, but that doesn't grant her the right to be rude. The author's past experiences with her could add to their irritation, but that doesn't excuse the harsh response.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. Socially, it's more about manners and family dynamics. The author had the right to say no, but their response might be seen as inappropriate. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was also inconsiderate and disrespectful.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both sides. The sister-in-law's overbearing behavior is a problem, but the author's response was also uncivil. However, since the sister-in-law was the first to act disrespectfully, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the author's response escalated the conflict, so maybe they are at least partially at fault.\n\nBut in terms of who is more in the wrong, the sister-in-law's initial behavior was more egregious. The author's response, while rude, might be a reaction to being talked down to. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the sister-in-law started it, and the author's response, while harsh, is understandable given the context.\n"
