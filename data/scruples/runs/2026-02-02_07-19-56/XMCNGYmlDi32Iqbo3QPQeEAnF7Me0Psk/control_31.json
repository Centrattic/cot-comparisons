I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict between the author and their sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the author declined their brother's dinner invite because they were tired, planning to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent a very aggressive text, demanding that the author attend the dinner immediately. The author, clearly upset, responded with \"Fuck off,\" leading to the sister-in-law's defensive reply.\n\nNow, considering the sister-in-law's message: she's using commanding language, calling the author out for not respecting their brother, and even implying rudeness. That's pretty harsh. The author's response is a strong swear word, which is definitely disrespectful, but maybe it's a reaction to being talked down to.\n\nThe sister-in-law is pregnant, which the author mentions, but the author argues that pregnancy doesn't grant the right to be rude. However, the sister-in-law's previous behavior (insulting the author's mother) is noted, which might have contributed to the tension. The brother sides with his wife, adding to the author's frustration.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The sister-in-law's initial message was condescending and overbearing, which might have provoked the author. But the author's response was also unkind. However, the sister-in-law's message was the catalyst. The author had already declined the dinner invitation, so the sister-in-law's reaction could be seen as overstepping. The author's outburst might be justified in the context of ongoing tensions, but it's still a poor choice in communication.\n\nBut considering that the sister-in-law was being disrespectful first, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the author did respond with a swear word, which is unprofessional and disrespectful regardless. But maybe in this context, given the sister-in-law's tone, the author's reaction is understandable. Still, it's impolite. \n\nAlternatively, the sister-in-law was being rude, so the author's response, while harsh, could be seen as a justified reaction to being talked down to. However, the author could have handled it better. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the sister-in-law was being disrespectful, then the author's anger is a reaction to that.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if provoked, using a swear word is typically seen as the wrong move. So the author is in the wrong for their response. But maybe the sister-in-law's initial message is to blame. However, the question is about the author's actions. The author chose to respond with a swear word, which is unkind. So even if provoked, the author's response is what's in question. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But some might argue B because the sister-in-law was being rude first. It's a bit of a toss-up. But generally, responding with a swear word is frowned upon, so A.\n"
