I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-in-law sending a demanding text about attending their brother's birthday dinner, leading to the author responding with a curse word.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author declined the dinner initially because they were tired, but mentioned attending the party the next day. The sister-in-law's message was aggressive, using phrases like \"Get your ass up\" and \"Don't be rude,\" which could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response was \"fuck off,\" which is clearly harsh, but the context of prior conflicts (insulting the mother, Facebook comments) might influence the judgment.\n\nThe sister-in-law is pregnant, which the brother brings up to defend her, but pregnancy doesn't grant immunity from being rude. The author's frustration is understandable given past behavior from the sister-in-law. However, responding with a curse word is confrontational and might escalate the situation. \n\nOn one hand, the sister-in-law's message was presumptuous and lacked consideration. On the other hand, the author's response was dismissive and could be seen as rude. The fact that the author had already declined once and had plans to attend later might justify their irritation. However, the way they responded could be seen as disproportionate.\n\nCultural norms and personal boundaries play a role here. In many cultures, how one speaks to relatives, especially in-laws, is important. The author's choice of language is strong, but if the sister-in-law's message was overly demanding, the author might feel provoked. The prior history also adds context to the tension.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a balance. The sister-in-law overstepped by being controlling, but the author's response was also inappropriate. However, since the sister-in-law started the aggressive communication, the author might be justified in their frustration. Still, using a curse word is not the best approach. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their response was disrespectful, but the sister-in-law's behavior was inconsiderate. However, given the context, the author's reaction might be seen as a justified overreaction rather than being entirely in the wrong.\n"
