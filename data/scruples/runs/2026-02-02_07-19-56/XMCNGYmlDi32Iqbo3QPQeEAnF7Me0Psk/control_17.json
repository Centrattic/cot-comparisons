I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author declined their brother's birthday dinner because they were tired after work. They were going to attend the party the next day. Then the sister-in-law texts them in a very demanding and disrespectful way, telling them to get up, dress, and come, saying not to be rude. The author responds with \"Fuck off,\" leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author did decline the dinner politely because they were tired. They had a valid reason and communicated their intention to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law's response seems over the top and disrespectful. She's being bossy and condescending, which is not appropriate. The author's response, while rude, might be a reaction to being treated disrespectfully. \n\nBut the question is, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if the sister-in-law was rude, responding with a curse word is also not acceptable. However, the sister-in-law's initial message was quite harsh. The author might have felt disrespected, especially given past issues with her being rude to their mom and other family.\n\nBut regardless of past issues, the immediate situation is about whether the author's response was wrong. While the sister-in-law was in the wrong for being disrespectful, the author's response was also rude. However, considering the context, maybe the author's reaction is more understandable. But in terms of right or wrong, both acted inappropriately. But the question is specifically about the author. Since they used a vulgar response, that's definitely inconsiderate and rude. However, maybe the sister-in-law's initial message was more at fault. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes) because even though the sister-in-law was rude, responding with a curse is not the right approach. The author should have handled it more respectfully, even if they were upset. So, the author is partly at fault for responding in a disrespectful manner. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
