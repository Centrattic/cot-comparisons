I kindly declined because I had came home from work and did not want to go out, because of how tired I was. I was planning on be attending his birthday party the day after which is tonight and they both knew that. \n\nHalf an hour later I check my phone and I see that I received a text from my sister in law which said the following: \"It's your brother's 30th birthday. Get your ass up. Get dressed and we will pick you up in 30 minutes. I dont even want to hear it. Dont be rude. Have some respect for your brother.\"\n\nAm I the asshole that my blood boiled so hard after reading this text message that I texted back to her \"Fuck off.\" to which she replied: \"Excuse me? Have you lost your mind? How dare you even speak to me this way?\" \n\nShe is 1 month pregnant and my brother flipped off on me and told me that I am wrong and she is pregnant. I'm not a female but being pregnant does not mean you have a right to be a fucking cunt and talk to me like a child. Just a quick backstory - She has insulted my mother on my mothers birthday before and straight up talked shit about my parents onf facebook. I'm just so irritated by this event and nobody is on my side. \n\nTl:dr - I said no to coming to my brother's birthday dinner because I was tired after work but I was going to the party the day after. I get a text from my sister-in-law talking down to me like I am a child to which I replied \"fuck off\" \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister-in-law to fuck off. The situation is about a family conflict during a birthday event.\n\nFirst, the author declined to attend their brother's dinner because they were tired but had plans to attend the party the next day. The sister-in-law then sent an aggressive message ordering the author to get up and join them, which the author found disrespectful. The author responded with a harsh text, which led to further conflict. The sister-in-law is pregnant, which adds another layer, but the author argues that pregnancy doesn't justify the sister-in-law's tone.\n\nNow, assessing who's at fault. The sister-in-law's message seems condescending and controlling. She's telling the author what to do in a demeaning way, which is uncalled for. However, the author's response of \"fuck off\" is also very disrespectful. Even if the sister-in-law was being rude, responding with a curse word is not appropriate. The author chose a confrontational approach instead of a calm discussion or ignoring the message. \n\nThe author mentions past issues where the sister-in-law insulted their mother and posted negative comments about the parents. That context might explain some of the frustration, but it doesn't justify the harsh response. Both sides have issues: the sister-in-law's tone is disrespectful, and the author's response is equally rude. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author escalated the situation with a vulgar reply, even if provoked, they bear some responsibility. But maybe the sister-in-law started it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being disrespectful to family members is generally frowned upon. The author chose a harsh response, which could be seen as the immediate wrong. Even if the sister-in-law was inconsiderate, responding with a curse is not the right approach. The author could have handled it by not engaging or addressing the issue calmly later. So, in this case, the author is in the wrong for their response, even if they felt disrespected first.\n"
