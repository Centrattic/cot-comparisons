I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their girlfriend without warning after discovering she cheated, especially considering she's financially dependent on him. \n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal, so the author's anger is understandable. However, the way he handled it might be problematic. He changed the locks, removed her stuff, and cut off communication abruptly. While the betrayal justifies ending the relationship, ghosting and removing her belongings without a proper conversation could be seen as harsh, especially since she's financially dependent. \n\nThe parents are concerned she might have to drop out of school, which adds another layer. The author might be making a life-altering decision for her without considering the consequences. Even though he's hurt, cutting her off completely and not allowing a discussion might be inconsiderate. The right approach might have been to have a difficult conversation, perhaps allowing her time to adjust financially, instead of an abrupt exit. \n\nSo, while he isn't wrong for ending the relationship due to cheating, the method he used might be where he's at fault. Therefore, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because of the abrupt and potentially harmful way he ended things, despite the valid reason for breaking up.\n"
