I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their girlfriend after she cheated, especially considering she's financially dependent on him and he ghosted her without warning.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that it's a valid reason to end a relationship. The author mentions being angry rather than sad, which is a common reaction. But the way he handled it\u2014changing the locks without warning and packing her stuff\u2014might be where things get tricky.\n\nFinancial dependency is a big factor here. She's been out of a job to pursue a medical degree, and he's been supporting her financially. By cutting off all contact and removing her from their home abruptly, he's left her in a vulnerable position. The parents are worried she might have to drop out, which adds to the complexity. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the method of ending the relationship was wrong. Ghosting and not giving her a chance to explain might be seen as harsh. Even though cheating is a deal-breaker, handling it without communication could be considered inconsiderate, especially given her financial situation. She might need time to adjust or find support.\n\nHe changed the locks while she was at class, which prevents her from retrieving her belongings. Making her rely on her brother to get her stuff adds another layer of difficulty. The author's anger is understandable, but the abruptness and lack of communication might have been unnecessary. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he might be right to leave because of the betrayal, but the way he did it could leave her in a worse position. The parents' concerns about her education and well-being aren't baseless. So while the infidelity justifies the breakup, the method could be seen as callous. \n\nTherefore, the author is partially in the wrong because of the way he handled the situation, despite the valid reason for ending the relationship.\n"
