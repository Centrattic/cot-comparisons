I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author left their girlfriend after discovering she cheated. The key points here are the years they were together, the financial support, and how he ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, cheating is a betrayal, so most people would agree that the author has a valid reason to break up. But the way he did it\u2014changing the locks without warning and ghosting\u2014might be problematic. He didn't confront her first, just took action by changing the locks and packing her stuff. That seems abrupt and possibly disrespectful. \n\nHe also mentions she's financially dependent on him, and now she might have to drop out of her medical degree. Her family is concerned about her education and future. The author's anger is understandable, but the suddenness and lack of communication could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key, even in breakups. Ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if they cheated. The author's actions might be considered controlling or not giving her a chance to explain herself. But cheating is a major issue, and the author is within his right to end the relationship. \n\nSo the question is: is the method of breaking up wrong, even if the reason (cheating) is justified? Some might say the way he did it is inconsiderate, especially given her financial situation. Others might say the betrayal was so severe that he was justified in ending things immediately. \n\nThe meta issue is about whether he's an asshole for leaving her. The user says he knows he's not an asshole, but the method is the concern. So the answer depends on the perspective: legal rights don't make one morally right about the approach. The author isn't wrong for ending the relationship due to cheating, but the approach could be seen as inconsiderate or harsh. However, the options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Since the main issue is the method, but the core action (ending the relationship) isn't wrong, maybe it's B. But the way he did it makes the situation more complicated. The family's reaction suggests there's a bigger impact on her life. \n\nBut the core of the question is about the author's actions being wrong, not just the method. Since cheating is a valid reason for leaving, the author isn't in the wrong. The method might be questionable, but the decision itself isn't. So the answer is B.\n"
