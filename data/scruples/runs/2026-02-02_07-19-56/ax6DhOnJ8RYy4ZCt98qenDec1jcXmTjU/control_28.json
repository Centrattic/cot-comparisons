I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated. The situation is that they've been together for 7 years, discussed marriage and kids. She quit her job to get a medical degree and he's been supporting her financially. He found out she cheated and got angry. He changed the locks, took her stuff out, and told her he doesn't want to see her again. Now their parents are pressuring him to let her stay because she might have to drop out otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. Cheating is a serious issue in a relationship. Generally, when someone cheats, the wronged party has the right to end the relationship. But the way he did it\u2014without warning, ghosting, and removing her stuff\u2014might be the point of contention here. The key elements here are the right to end the relationship vs. the method used.\n\nHe's financially supporting her, which complicates things. If she's dependent on him, just cutting her off might leave her in a bad situation. But he's not necessarily wrong for ending the relationship. The problem might be in how he handled the aftermath. Ghosting without communication could be seen as harsh, especially if she's in a vulnerable position. However, cheating is a betrayal, and he's justified in feeling angry and wanting to end things immediately. \n\nThe parents' argument is that she might have to drop out, which is a consequence. But is he responsible for that? If they had discussed marriage and future, maybe he expected to support her, but after cheating, he's not obligated to continue. The question is whether he's in the wrong for the method. Some might say that even though she cheated, the abrupt action without allowing her to explain could be problematic. Others might say that after cheating, he's within his rights to end things however he wants.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because the cheating is a major reason to end the relationship. However, the way he left might be considered harsh, but the core issue is her betrayal. The parents' concern is about her well-being, but he's not required to continue the relationship. So he's not the asshole, but maybe could have handled it better for her sake. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about being a good person. Cheating is the main issue here.\n"
