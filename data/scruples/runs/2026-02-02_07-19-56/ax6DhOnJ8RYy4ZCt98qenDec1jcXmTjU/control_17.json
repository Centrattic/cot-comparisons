I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting their girlfriend after she cheated. The situation is a bit complex. The couple has been together for 7 years, talked about marriage and kids. The girlfriend quit her job to pursue a medical degree, which means she's financially dependent on the author. Then she cheated, and the author decided to leave abruptly, changing locks and moving her stuff out without warning.\n\nFirst, the cheating is a major issue. Generally, cheating is a deal-breaker for many people. The author was angry because he invested a lot, both emotionally and financially. He's supporting her through college, paying for rent, food, tuition. That's a significant investment. The anger is understandable. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting, changing locks, not giving her a chance to explain\u2014might be problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend is financially dependent, so when he kicks her out, she might not have the means to support herself right now, especially since she's in medical school. Her parents are worried she'll have to drop out. The author's actions could have serious consequences for her, which he might not have considered. Even if she cheated, cutting off all contact and financial support suddenly could leave her in a vulnerable position.\n\nThe author's parents and in-laws are contacting him, suggesting that 7 years shouldn't be thrown away over cheating, and that the financial repercussions are too harsh. The author's approach might be seen as harsh because he didn't give her a chance to explain or discuss the situation. Ghosting is often viewed as inconsiderate because it doesn't allow for closure or a conversation. \n\nBut then again, the author is justified in being hurt and angry. Cheating is a betrayal, and he's within his rights to end the relationship. However, the abruptness and lack of communication, especially considering her dependency, could make him in the wrong. The key here is whether his response was proportionate and considerate of her situation.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a mix. The cheating is a valid reason to break up, but the execution was harsh. The author might not be an asshole for leaving, but the way he handled it could be seen as wrong because he didn't consider her financial instability or give her a chance to address the situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the method of breaking up was overly harsh and could cause undue harm, even if the reason (cheating) is valid.\n"
