I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated. The main points to consider are the cheating, the method of ending the relationship, and the financial dependency.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal, so that's a valid reason to end the relationship. The author was angry and hurt, which is understandable. But the way he handled it\u2014changing locks without notice and packing her stuff\u2014could be seen as harsh. He didn't confront her first or give her a chance to explain, which might be seen as cutting off communication abruptly. Ghosting usually means no contact, but here, he did make contact by texting about the locks and offering to have her brother retrieve items. However, the suddenness and lack of a face-to-face conversation could be problematic. \n\nAlso, she's financially dependent on him, so kicking her out without a plan might leave her in a tough spot. The parents are concerned about her dropping out of school. The author's actions might be seen as selfish if they're causing her financial hardship. Even though he's angry, there's a responsibility when someone relies on you financially. \n\nOn the other hand, the cheating was a deal-breaker for him. He might feel justified in ending things, but the method could be more considerate. He could have had a direct conversation to address the betrayal and then decided on moving out. The author's parents are suggesting that the relationship is worth saving, but if trust is broken, that's a personal decision. \n\nSo, while the infidelity is a valid reason to end things, the abrupt and unilateral actions of changing locks and ghosting might be seen as inconsiderate, especially considering her financial situation. The key issue here is how he handled the breakup. Ending a relationship over cheating isn't wrong, but the method could be more compassionate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way he went about it.\n"
