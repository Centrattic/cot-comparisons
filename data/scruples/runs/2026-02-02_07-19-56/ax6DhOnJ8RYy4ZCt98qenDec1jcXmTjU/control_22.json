I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their girlfriend without warning after discovering she cheated. The key points here are the infidelity and the sudden, harsh method of ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal in most relationships. The author had been in a long-term, committed relationship, planning for marriage and kids. The fact that she cheated is a big deal, and it's understandable that he's angry and hurt. But the way he handled it is what's under scrutiny here. \n\nHe changed the locks, packed her stuff outside, and cut off all communication. This is ghosting and could leave her in a difficult situation, especially since she's financially dependent on him and in medical school. The parents are worried she might have to drop out, which adds another layer of complexity. \n\nSo, while the cheating justifies ending the relationship, the abrupt and unemotional method might be problematic. Ending a relationship without any warning, especially when the other person is in a vulnerable position, could be seen as cruel. He could have given her a chance to explain, or at least provided support during the transition instead of cutting her off completely. \n\nThe author's anger is valid, but the way he acted out might have been too harsh. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and being considerate of the other person's circumstances. The parents' concerns about her education and financial state are also valid factors here. \n\nIn conclusion, while the cheating isn't his fault, his response might have been too extreme given her dependency. He's not the asshole for ending the relationship due to cheating, but the method of doing so could be questioned. Therefore, the answer is B (No), but with the caveat that the approach could have been handled more empathetically.\n"
