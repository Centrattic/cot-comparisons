I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a seven-year relationship where the girlfriend cheated, and the author decided to ghost her without warning, including changing the locks and removing her stuff. The key points to consider are the cheating, the sudden action without communication, the financial dependency, and the family's reaction.\n\nFirst, cheating is a serious issue. Many people would consider it a deal-breaker, so the author's anger is understandable. However, the way he handled it\u2014changing the locks and ghosting\u2014could be problematic. Ghosting is generally seen as immature or inconsiderate because it cuts off communication suddenly, which can leave the other person confused and without closure.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend is financially dependent on him and that she's pursuing a medical degree. By cutting her off, he's putting her in a position where she might have to drop out, which adds an ethical layer. Even though she cheated, is it fair to make her drop out of school because of his reaction? That could be seen as exacerbating her mistake rather than holding her accountable for her actions.\n\nThe family's reaction is another point. Both families are upset, which suggests that the author's approach was harsh. The parents argue that seven years is a significant time and that there might be a way to address the cheating without ending the relationship abruptly. The author's actions might be seen as prioritizing his own anger over considering the practical consequences for her education and future.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels justified in leaving because of the betrayal. He might believe that the relationship was beyond repair, and the ghosting was a way to enforce a clean break. However, the method of cutting her off without giving her a chance to explain or apologize could be seen as insensitive. Even if she cheated, a more mature approach might involve having a conversation to express hurt and make decisions about the future together.\n\nFinancial dependency complicates things further. If she's dependent on him, abruptly cutting off support without any transition could be seen as inconsiderate. Maybe he should have given her time to adjust or find alternative support. The fact that he removed her stuff and changed the locks immediately might be interpreted as being self-centered, focusing on his own emotional needs without considering her situation.\n\nIn terms of morality and social norms, while cheating is wrong, the response should ideally be measured. Ghosting isn't typically considered an appropriate response because it lacks communication. Even if the author is justified in ending the relationship, doing so without any explanation or opportunity for discussion is likely to be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be in the right for ending the relationship due to the betrayal but in the wrong for how he executed the breakup, especially given her financial dependency and education status.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the harsh and abrupt method of ending the relationship, despite the cheating. However, some might argue that he's justified in leaving, but the way he did it is still problematic. The key issue is the lack of communication and consideration for her situation.\n"
