I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 7-year relationship where the author left their girlfriend after discovering she cheated. The girlfriend was financially dependent on him, and he ghosted her by changing the locks and removing her stuff without warning.\n\nFirst, the cheating part. Cheating is a major betrayal, and in many relationships, it's a deal-breaker. So from that angle, the author might feel justified in ending the relationship. But the way he ended it is the main issue here. Ghosting and abruptly cutting off someone, especially when they're financially dependent, could be problematic.\n\nHe changed the locks while she was at class and didn't let her retrieve her belongings. That could leave her in a difficult situation. She's in medical school, which is a big investment. If she can't continue due to sudden displacement, that's a serious consequence. The parents are worried about her dropping out and wasting her education. The author's actions might be seen as harsh, even if the cheating is the reason.\n\nThe author says he was angry. Acting out of anger without considering the practical consequences for the other person is a red flag. Communication is key in such situations. Even if you're ending the relationship, respecting the other person's financial and emotional state is important. Instead of immediately removing her stuff and cutting off contact, maybe a more compassionate approach, like giving her time to move out or helping her transition, would have been better.\n\nAlso, the fact that they talked about marriage and future kids shows a long-term commitment. The author's reaction might be too abrupt, not allowing any closure or discussion. Ghosting after a betrayal can lead to feelings of rejection and confusion, which isn't fair to the other person, no matter how hurt you are.\n\nBut then again, cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. The problem here is the method. The author didn't just break up with her; he took actions that could leave her without a place to live and in a financial crisis. That's where the ethical question comes in. Ending a relationship because of cheating isn't the issue, but doing it in a way that harms the other person's well-being might be the wrong approach.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because of the abrupt and potentially harmful way he ended the relationship, despite the cheating. The key points are the ghosting, lack of communication, and the financial dependency of the ex-girlfriend. He should have handled it with more consideration for her situation.\n"
