I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who left their girlfriend after she cheated is in the wrong. The situation is complex because she was financially dependent on him and he ghosted her without warning.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that infidelity is a deal-breaker. But how he handled the breakup is what's in question here. He changed the locks and packed her stuff without giving her a chance to explain. That's pretty harsh, especially since she's financially dependent. She might not have a job or a place to go, so cutting her off abruptly without support could be seen as cruel. \n\nHe's angry, which is understandable, but his actions might be impulsive. Ghosting without communication can leave someone in a bad position. Even though she cheated, the way he ended things could leave her in a financial and emotional crisis. His parents and hers are worried about her dropping out of school, which adds another layer. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not in the wrong for ending the relationship after cheating. But the method\u2014changing locks and not giving her a chance to talk\u2014might be where he's at fault. It's about how to handle such a breakup responsibly. Maybe a more compassionate approach, even if he's angry, would be better. So, is he an asshole? Maybe not for ending the relationship, but definitely for the way he did it. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
