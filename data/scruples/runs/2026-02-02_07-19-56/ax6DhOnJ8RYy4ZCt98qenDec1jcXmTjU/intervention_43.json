I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they ended a 7+ year relationship with their girlfriend, who was financially dependent on them and had left her job to pursue a medical degree. The author found out she cheated and got really angry, then had a locksmith change the locks while she was at class, packed her stuff and left it outside, and told her not to contact them again. Both their parents are upset, saying she might have to drop out of school and that it's not a reason to throw away the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications here. Cheating is generally considered a betrayal, so the author's decision to end the relationship isn't inherently wrong. However, the method of doing so is where the controversy might lie. Ghosting without warning, especially in a long-term relationship, can be seen as harsh. The fact that the girlfriend was financially dependent adds another layer. By cutting her off suddenly, the author is taking away her means of support, which could have severe consequences for her, like being unable to continue her education or being left without a place to stay. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable, but the way they acted on it might be problematic. Changing locks and removing her belongings without allowing her to retrieve them in a more reasonable timeframe could be seen as cutting her off completely without any support, even if the relationship is ending. The parents' concern is that she might be forced to drop out of school, which is a valid point because her education is a significant investment, and she's been supported through it. The author might be seen as prioritizing their own anger over her well-being and the financial support she's been receiving.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have a right to end the relationship due to cheating, but the abruptness and lack of communication could be where the issue is. Letting her go without a plan for her to transition out, especially in a financially dependent situation, could be inconsiderate. It's possible that the author's actions, while justified in the betrayal, are exacerbating the situation by leaving her in a difficult spot without any support. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author has the right to end the relationship as they see fit, especially if they're hurt and angry. The girlfriend made a choice to cheat, so the author isn't obligated to continue supporting her. However, the ethical side often considers the impact on the other person, particularly in cases of financial dependency. Ending the relationship is one thing, but cutting her off completely without any lead time might be seen as cruel, especially if she's not in a position to suddenly support herself.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong in the way they ended the relationship. The answer would likely be A (yes), because while the cheating is the girlfriend's fault, the author's method of ending things is considered too harsh and inconsiderate given the circumstances. They should have handled it with more communication and perhaps allowed her some time to adjust rather than removing her belongings and changing locks immediately without prior notice.\n"
