I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who left their girlfriend after discovering she cheated was in the wrong. The key points here are the cheating and the way he handled the breakup.\n\nFirst, cheating is a significant betrayal in most relationships. The guy found out through her phone, which might be a point of contention. But the bigger issue is his reaction. He changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her without a conversation. He also mentions she's financially dependent on him and that she's in medical school. \n\nSo, legally, he's the one who provided the means for her education. If she can't continue without his support, dropping out could be a real risk. But ethically, he's angry about the betrayal. He might feel justified in cutting ties, but the abruptness and lack of communication could be problematic. \n\nThe parents are upset because they think he's being too harsh. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's the one who cheated, then it would be different, but he didn't. She did. However, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and cutting off all contact\u2014without giving her a chance to explain might be seen as harsh. But considering the betrayal, some might say he's justified. \n\nFinancial dependence complicates things. He might feel he's being used, but he's also been supporting her for years. The real question is whether his actions were too abrupt. Ghosting isn't ideal, but the cheating can be a valid reason to leave. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, he's clear he's not one for leaving her. The problem is the method. He didn't give her a chance to respond, which could be seen as cold. But given the betrayal, some people might say he's within his rights. \n\nSo, considering all factors, maybe the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong. The cheating is a major issue, and while the way he left was harsh, his anger and need to protect himself are understandable. However, there's a nuance here. The ethical answer might depend on cultural views and personal values. But in the context of the question, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Given that he's the one who was cheated on, and the parents are pressuring him, the answer leans towards B.\n"
