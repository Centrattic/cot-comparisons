I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a seven-year relationship where the guy found out his girlfriend cheated. She was financially dependent on him, and he left her without warning by changing the locks and packing her stuff. The main question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman cheated, which is a serious breach of trust. The man was angry and decided to end the relationship abruptly. He didn't give her a chance to explain, maybe? Or did he just act out of anger? Also, she's financially dependent on him, so leaving her like that could have significant consequences for her, like dropping out of school.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a major deal. Most people would say that the person who cheated is at fault. But the way the man handled it\u2014ghosting, changing locks without notice, not allowing her to retrieve belongings\u2014might be seen as harsh, even if she cheated. Especially since she's in a vulnerable position financially. The parents are concerned about her education and well-being.\n\nHe says he's not in the wrong because he's angry and feels betrayed. But the method of ending the relationship might be where he's in the wrong. Even if she cheated, cutting her off completely without any communication could be seen as cruel, especially considering her financial dependence. Maybe he should have had a conversation first, given her a chance to explain, or at least provided more support during the transition.\n\nAlso, the fact that they had long-term plans like marriage and kids shows that this was a serious relationship. The suddenness of his actions might leave her in a difficult situation, which could be seen as irresponsible. However, the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship. The problem is how he went about it.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: cheating is a valid reason to break up, but the way he did it might be considered harsh and possibly inconsiderate of her circumstances. Therefore, he's not the asshole for ending the relationship because of the cheating, but the manner in which he ended it could be seen as wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. The answer depends on whether the method of ending the relationship is considered wrong despite the cheating.\n"
