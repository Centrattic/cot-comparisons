I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he left his girlfriend after discovering she cheated on him. She's financially dependent on him, and he ghosted her without warning. He's supporting her through medical school, and now they're both getting pressure from their families to reconcile because she might have to drop out if she leaves.\n\nFirst, cheating is a big deal. Most people would agree that cheating is a serious betrayal. However, the way the author handled it is questionable. He changed the locks without warning, packed her stuff, and cut off all communication. That's pretty harsh. Even though she was financially dependent on him, that doesn't mean he has a right to control her or make unilateral decisions. If she's dependent on him financially, suddenly cutting her off could leave her in a vulnerable position. The families are worried she'll have to drop out of school, which adds another layer of complexity. \n\nBut then again, the author was in a long-term relationship with marriage and kids discussed. The cheating was with an ex who isn't going anywhere in life, which the author finds confusing. His anger is understandable given the investment over seven years. However, the method of ending the relationship\u2014ghosting and taking away her housing\u2014seems extreme. He could have given her a chance to explain, even if he was angry. Communication is usually important in resolving conflicts, even when betrayal is involved. \n\nAlso, financial dependence can be tricky. If he was supporting her through school, maybe there were discussions about that. But suddenly removing her from her environment without support might not be fair. He should consider how she can continue her education without him. Maybe he could have had a conversation where he ends the relationship but helps her transition out of the financial dependence, instead of abruptly cutting her off. \n\nSo, while the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship, the way he went about it\u2014without communication or support\u2014could be seen as wrong. He's choosing to punish her for the cheating by making her life harder, which might not be fair. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the abrupt and harsh method, even though the cheating is a valid reason to break up.\n"
