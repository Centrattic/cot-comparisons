I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their girlfriend after finding out she cheated. The key points here are that they've been together for 7+ years, she's financially dependent on him, and they were planning marriage and kids. She had left her job to study for a medical degree, which he's been supporting financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of cheating. Cheating is generally a major breach of trust, so the author's anger is understandable. However, the way he handled it is the main issue here. He changed the locks without warning, packed her stuff outside, and texted her, not wanting to communicate anymore. His parents and her parents are upset because he's cutting her off completely, which could force her to drop out of college, leading to significant personal and financial consequences.\n\nNow, the question is whether his actions were wrong. While the infidelity is justified as a reason to end the relationship, the method he chose\u2014ghosting and sudden removal from their home\u2014might be problematic. Ghosting can be cruel, especially when the person is financially dependent. By cutting her off abruptly, he's not giving her a chance to explain herself, which is a common criticism in such situations. People often say that even if you're leaving, you should handle it respectfully and provide support if possible, given the financial entanglements.\n\nAlso, the parents' concerns about her dropping out of school and wasting her education add another layer. If she's in a vulnerable position without her own financial resources, leaving her out of their home immediately could be seen as harsh and possibly irresponsible. The author might be in the right to end the relationship but wrong in the execution, especially if there's a lack of communication or consideration for her well-being and future.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels wronged and might be justified in cutting ties to prevent further emotional pain. However, the suddenness and lack of empathy in the process could make his actions seem hurtful. The parents' calls for mediation and consideration might be valid because they see the broader impact, not just the infidelity. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the approach taken was too abrupt and uncaring, despite the justified reason for the breakup. The author isn't an asshole for ending the relationship because cheating is a deal-breaker for many, but the way he did it\u2014ghosting and removing her belongings without a conversation\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in terms of their handling of the situation, even if the reason is valid.\n"
