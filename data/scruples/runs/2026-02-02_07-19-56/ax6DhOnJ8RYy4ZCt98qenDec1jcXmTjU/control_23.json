I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the girlfriend cheated, and the author left her without warning, ghosting her. She was financially dependent on him, and now her parents and his parents are upset about the sudden breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author discovered cheating, which is a major betrayal. Cheating is often a dealbreaker for many people. The relationship had been going on for 7 years, with plans for marriage and kids. The girlfriend quit her job to pursue a medical degree, which he supported financially. When he found out about the infidelity, he felt angry and decided to leave her abruptly by changing the locks, packing her stuff, and sending a final text. He didn't want to talk anymore. Now, the parents are pressuring him to reconsider because she might have to drop out of school, but he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. Cheating is a significant breach of trust. The author's reaction is understandable, as betrayal can trigger anger and a desire to end things quickly. However, the way he handled the breakup is important. Ghosting and cutting her off without warning, especially when she's financially dependent, could be seen as harsh. She might be in a vulnerable position now, unable to continue her education without financial support, which he was providing. \n\nOn the other hand, the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship. The author might feel that the trust is irreparably broken and that staying would be unfair. However, the abruptness and lack of communication could be problematic. Ending a long-term relationship without giving her time to adjust financially could add to her hardships. Even if he's angry, there's a consideration for her well-being, especially since she's in a vulnerable position.\n\nThe parents' arguments are about the suddenness leading to her dropping out, which could be seen as an unintended consequence. The author's responsibility in that is debatable. Did he have a duty to make her transition easier even after the breakup? Or is it her responsibility to have a plan, given she was financially dependent on him?\n\nAlso, the fact that he changed the locks and removed her belongings without prior discussion might be seen as extreme. While it's his choice to end the relationship, doing it in a way that leaves her homeless could be considered inconsiderate, even if he's angry. There might be a more compassionate approach, even if he doesn't want to talk to her\u2014like giving her notice to find another place or a way to retrieve her stuff without cutting her off completely.\n\nHowever, the infidelity is a justifiable reason to end things. The anger is a natural response, and he might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship. The main issue is the method. So, the question is whether the method of ending the relationship (ghosting and abrupt removal) makes him the asshole, even if the reason is valid.\n\nIn some perspectives, the reason (cheating) is justifiable, but the method is wrong. In others, if someone cheated, the person ending the relationship isn't obligated to handle it with care, especially if they're hurt and angry. But the financial dependency adds another layer. The author might have a responsibility to ensure she's not left in a dire situation, regardless of the cheating.\n\nSo, considering both the reason (valid) and the method (abrupt and potentially harmful), the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship but might have been wrong in the way he did it. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. The options are A (yes) or B (no). If the main reason is cheating, which is a justified reason, then the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship. However, the way he handled it could still be considered inconsiderate. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. So if the answer is about the core action (ending the relationship due to cheating), then B (no). If the answer is about the method of ending, which is harsh, then maybe A. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong overall. \n\nIn AITA situations, the focus is on whether the person's actions are acceptable. Here, the action is ending the relationship due to cheating, which is acceptable. However, the abruptness and ghosting might be seen as asshole behavior. The parents' concern is about the consequences, which the author might need to address. The author's own view is that he's not an asshole for leaving her, but the way he did it is the concern. \n\nIn AITA threads, people often consider both the reason and the method. So, if the reason is valid but the method is inconsiderate, the answer could be that he's not an asshole for the action but might have handled it poorly. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not an asshole for leaving, then B (no). But if the method is considered wrong, then maybe A. But the user's own stance is that he's not an asshole, so the answer might lean towards B. However, in some cultures or perspectives, cutting someone off without any communication, especially in a vulnerable state, is seen as wrong regardless of the reason. So the answer could be A. \n\nThis is tricky. The key is whether the author's actions are considered asshole-like. In AITA, being an asshole isn't just about the reason but the behavior. So even if the reason is justifiable, the way he handled it (ghosting, abrupt removal) could be considered asshole behavior. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes). But others might argue that cheating justifies any reaction, so B. \n\nHmm. Given that the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the main issue is the method of ending the relationship, the answer might be A. The parents have a point that the suddenness could lead to her dropping out. Even if he's angry, he could have given her time to adjust. So the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
