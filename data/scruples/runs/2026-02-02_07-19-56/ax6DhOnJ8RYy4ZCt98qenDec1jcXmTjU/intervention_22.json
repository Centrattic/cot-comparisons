I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who left his girlfriend, who was financially dependent on him, without warning after discovering she cheated. He changed the locks, took her stuff out, and cut off all contact. Both families are upset, saying it's harsh and she might have to drop out of school.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions. Cheating is a major betrayal, so the decision to leave is understandable. However, the way he handled it is questionable. Ghosting without any communication, especially when she's financially dependent, could be seen as heartless. He didn't give her a chance to explain, even though the user says he's angry and doesn't want to talk. But cutting her off completely without any notice might leave her in a bad position, especially if she can't afford to live elsewhere or continue her education. \n\nThe author might argue that he's justified in ending the relationship due to the cheating. But the method of ending it\u2014locking her out, removing her belongings, and refusing all contact\u2014could be considered inconsiderate. The girlfriend's financial dependency adds another layer; he might have been responsible for her living situation, so abruptly removing her could have severe consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that after betrayal, it's his right to end things on his terms. But the lack of communication and the suddenness of the action might be seen as cruel, especially if she's left without a place to stay or financial support. The families' concerns about her dropping out of school also suggest that the fallout could be significant. \n\nConsidering all that, while the cheating is a valid reason to break up, the manner in which he did it\u2014without any warning or consideration for her situation\u2014might make him the asshole. So the answer would be A.\n"
