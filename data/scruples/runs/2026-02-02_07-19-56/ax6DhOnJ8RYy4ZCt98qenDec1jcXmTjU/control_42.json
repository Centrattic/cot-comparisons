I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the girlfriend cheated. The author decided to leave her without warning, changed the locks, packed her things, and texted her, making it clear he doesn't want to see her again. Now, both sets of parents are upset, worried about her dropping out of medical school due to being financially dependent on him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author was supporting her financially for her education and other expenses. His reaction was anger, leading to immediate action without prior communication. The main issue here is whether his method of ending the relationship was wrong, even though the cheating justifies the breakup.\n\nCheating is generally considered a valid reason to end a relationship, so the fact that he left because of it isn't necessarily the problem. The problem might be how he did it. Ghosting without explanation, changing locks without notice, and not allowing her to retrieve belongings could be seen as harsh, especially since she's financially dependent and in a vulnerable position. However, the author mentions he texted her about the actions taken and offered a way for her brother to get her remaining items. \n\nThe parents' concerns are about the financial dependency and her education. If she drops out, she loses years of effort. But the author might argue that the relationship was over, and he can't support her anymore after the betrayal. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while cheating is a significant issue, the way he ended the relationship could leave her in a difficult situation. Not providing a chance for her to explain herself or to wind down the financial support might be seen as abrupt and not considering her circumstances. However, given the betrayal, his anger and need for immediate distance is understandable. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, ending a relationship without warning, especially when the other person is dependent on you, can be seen as harsh. On the other hand, he discovered cheating and felt betrayed, which is a valid reason. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. If the focus is on the method rather than the justification, the way he handled it could be considered wrong because it left her in a precarious position financially and emotionally. However, if the focus is on the cheating, then his decision is understandable. \n\nSo, considering the user's own belief that he's not an asshole, but the method is questionable, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because of the abrupt and potentially harmful actions taken without prior communication, even if the reason is justified. But some might argue B (he's not in the wrong) because the cheating gives him the right to end the relationship as he saw fit. However, the key here is the way he did it. I think the consensus would be A, as the method is problematic despite the reason.\n"
