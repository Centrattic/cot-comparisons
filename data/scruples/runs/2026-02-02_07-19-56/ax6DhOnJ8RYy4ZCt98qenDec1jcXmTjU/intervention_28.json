I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their girlfriend cheated after being together for 7 years and decided to leave her without warning, changing the locks and packing her stuff out. Now their parents are upset because she's financially dependent on him and might have to drop out of school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the infidelity. Cheating is a major betrayal, and leaving in that case is understandable. But the way the author handled it is the focus here. Ghosting and sudden eviction without a conversation could be problematic. \n\nThe author was supporting her financially, including rent, food, tuition. She quit her job to pursue a medical degree, which is a significant commitment. By abruptly cutting off support, even if she cheated, could leave her in a vulnerable position. The parents' concern is valid because she might lose her education and face financial hardship. \n\nHowever, the author's anger and the immediate action might be a reaction to being hurt. The question is whether the method of ending the relationship is wrong. The author didn't give her a chance to explain or talk through it. Cheating is a deal-breaker for many, but the approach should consider the other person's well-being, especially given their financial dependence. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the author is justified in ending the relationship, the way they did it\u2014without notice, changing locks, and refusing any contact\u2014might be seen as harsh and inconsiderate. They might be cutting off support without considering the consequences for her. There's also the aspect of communication. Ending a long-term relationship with such a lack of communication could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the decision to leave is understandable.\n\nSo, while the cheating is the catalyst, the method of ending the relationship could be where the author is in the wrong. They might have a right to leave, but the way they did it ignores the practical realities of their partner's situation. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for the manner in which they ended the relationship, even if the decision itself is not.\n"
