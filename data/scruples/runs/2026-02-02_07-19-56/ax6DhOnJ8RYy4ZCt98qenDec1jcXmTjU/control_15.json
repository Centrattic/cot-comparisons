I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend after she cheated, especially since she's financially dependent on him. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, infidelity is a huge deal in relationships. Most people would agree that cheating is a deal-breaker. The author found out through her phone, which might be a point of contention. Did he have the right to check her phone? Maybe not, but the fact that she cheated is a major issue.\n\nHe left without warning, changed the locks, packed her stuff, and sent her a text. That seems pretty abrupt. Even if he's angry, cutting off communication completely and removing her from the home she's in might be harsh, especially considering her financial dependency. She's in medical school, so if she has to leave, she might not be able to finish her education, which her parents are emphasizing. \n\nBut on the other hand, he was supporting her financially. If she cheated, he might feel betrayed and just want out. The anger makes sense, but the way he handled it could be problematic. Ghosting and not allowing her to retrieve her belongings might be seen as cruel, especially if she's in a vulnerable position. \n\nThe parents are getting involved, which adds another layer. They're arguing that she should finish her education, but maybe they're more concerned about the financial implications for the author rather than her well-being. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did discover the infidelity, which is a valid reason to end the relationship. However, the abruptness and the way he handled the separation could be seen as harsh. He didn't give her a chance to explain or resolve the issue, and he left her in a situation where she might have to drop out of school. While her actions were wrong, the way he ended things might be considered inconsiderate, especially given her dependency. \n\nFinancial support is a big factor here. If he was the sole provider, cutting her off suddenly without a plan could leave her in a tough spot. Even though he's angry, there might be a more responsible way to handle it, like giving her some time to adjust or ensuring she can finish her education. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't necessarily the asshole for ending the relationship because cheating is a valid reason. However, the way he did it might be seen as inconsiderate, especially regarding her financial situation. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on the method rather than the decision to leave. So maybe he's not in the wrong for ending it, but the approach was flawed. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just the approach. The options are A for yes, B for no. Considering the situation, he did have a reason, but the execution was harsh. But the key point is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. Since he discovered cheating, which is a major betrayal, he's justified in ending the relationship. The way he did it might be questionable, but not necessarily making him the asshole. So answer B.\n"
