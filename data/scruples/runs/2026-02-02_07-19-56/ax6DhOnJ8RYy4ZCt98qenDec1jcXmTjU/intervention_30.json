I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author discovered their girlfriend cheated on them, so they decided to ghost her without prior communication, took drastic actions like changing the locks and removing her belongings, and now their families are upset.\n\nFirst, the cheating is a major betrayal. Generally, that's a deal-breaker for many people, so the author's decision to end the relationship isn't inherently wrong. But the way they handled it is the main issue here. Ghosting without explanation can be hurtful, even if the person did something wrong. The author didn't give their girlfriend a chance to explain or apologize. Cheating can have various underlying reasons, and cutting off all communication abruptly might not be the most mature approach.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is financially dependent on the author. She's in a medical program, and by cutting her off suddenly, she might lose her housing and financial support, which could force her to drop out. The author's parents and her parents argue that this is harsh and could ruin her education. The author might not have considered the consequences of their actions on her future, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable, but handling it by ghosting and taking her belongings out is extreme. A more measured approach, like having a conversation to discuss the betrayal and the decision to end the relationship, might have been better. Even if they decided to leave, giving some time and space for her to retrieve her things could be more respectful.\n\nSo, while the author has valid reasons for ending the relationship, the method they used is questionable. The key points are the lack of communication, the abruptness, and the potential harm to the girlfriend's education. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in terms of how they handled the breakup, despite the infidelity.\n"
