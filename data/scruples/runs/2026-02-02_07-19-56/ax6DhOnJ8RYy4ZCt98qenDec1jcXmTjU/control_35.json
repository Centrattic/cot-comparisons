I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThey were in a 7-year relationship with their girlfriend, planning marriage and kids. She quit her job to go to medical school, and he's been supporting her financially with rent, food, tuition, etc. Then he found out she cheated on him with an ex. Instead of dealing with it calmly, he got angry and decided to ghost her. He changed the locks, packed her stuff and left it outside, sent a text saying he doesn't want to see her again. Now both sets of parents are upset, saying that even though she cheated, they should work it out because she can't afford to drop out of school.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered a betrayal. The author clearly felt wronged, and the financial dependency complicates things. The way he handled it\u2014ghosting, changing locks without notice\u2014could be seen as harsh. Even if the cheating is a reason to break up, the method might be considered inconsiderate, especially since she's financially dependent on him. By cutting her off suddenly, he's putting her in a difficult position, potentially forcing her to drop out of school because she can't handle the financial burden anymore. His parents and hers are concerned about that.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author might feel that after 7 years and a betrayal, he's justified in ending the relationship abruptly. However, the responsibility of her financial situation could mean he has an obligation to handle it more thoughtfully, maybe give her time to adjust or find a way to support her during the transition. Ghosting and cutting her off without communication might be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable position, which could be considered wrong regardless of her actions.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the woman cheated, which is a valid reason to break up. However, the way he broke up\u2014without warning, leaving her in a financial bind\u2014could be seen as the author being in the wrong because he didn't consider her circumstances and the consequences of his actions. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because even though the cheating is her fault, the way he ended things was irresponsible and harsh.\n"
