I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated on him. They were in a long-term relationship, 7 years, planning marriage and kids. She left her job to pursue a medical degree, which he's been financially supporting.\n\nFirst, cheating is a huge betrayal. Most people would agree that's a deal-breaker. The author was angry, which is understandable. But the way he handled it\u2014changing the locks, packing her stuff, and cutting off communication without warning\u2014might be the issue here. Even though she's financially dependent on him, abruptly cutting her off could leave her in a tough spot, especially with her education and family involved.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the 7 years shouldn't be thrown away and that she might have to drop out. The author's actions might be seen as harsh, but he's also justified in ending the relationship because of cheating. The problem is the method: he didn't give her a chance to explain, maybe. Cheating is a big deal, but ghosting without communication can be seen as inconsiderate, especially when she's dependent on him financially.\n\nHe could have handled it more compassionately, maybe by discussing it first. But the core issue is her cheating, which is a major reason to break up. However, the way he did it\u2014without warning and cutting her off from her home\u2014might leave her without support. So, while the author isn't entirely wrong for ending the relationship, the manner in which he did it could be problematic. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and being considerate of the other person's situation.\n"
