I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author discovered their girlfriend cheated, and in response, they left her without warning, changed the locks on the house she was living in, packed up her stuff, and sent it outside. The girl is financially dependent on him, quitting her job to study medicine. Now her parents and his parents are upset because she might have to drop out of school if she's evicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: cheating. Generally, cheating is a major breach of trust, and many people would consider it a valid reason to end a relationship. The author didn't handle it gently, though. The way he left\u2014without warning, changing locks, packing her stuff\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially since she's financially dependent. Even if he's angry, cutting her off completely might leave her in a vulnerable position. \n\nThe parents' argument is that she might have to drop out of school, which would be a significant loss. The author's actions could be seen as not considering her well-being beyond his own hurt and anger. Even if she cheated, the abrupt and harsh response might make him appear unkind or inconsiderate. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author might argue that cheating justified leaving, and he had a right to be angry. However, the method of leaving is important here. The rightness or wrongness often depends on how one handles the breakup, especially when someone is dependent. Ghosting and cutting her off completely without communication might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his actions, while perhaps justified in intent, were handled in a way that's reasonable. Since he's financially supporting her, abruptly ending support without a plan could be seen as abandoning her, which might be considered wrong, even if the cheating is a valid reason to break up. \n\nSo, the author might not be an \"asshole\" for leaving, but the way he did it could be seen as wrong. The answer would be A (Yes) because, despite the reason, the method was harsh and possibly irresponsible towards her situation.\n"
