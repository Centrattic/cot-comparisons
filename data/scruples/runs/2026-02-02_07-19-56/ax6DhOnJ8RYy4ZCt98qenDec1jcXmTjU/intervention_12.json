I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a seven-year relationship where the girlfriend cheated, and he left her without warning, changed the locks, and sent her stuff out. The key points here are the cheating, the financial dependency, and the sudden, harsh reaction.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal in most relationships. The author feels angry because he's been supporting her financially through her education, and she cheated with someone he looks down on. He's not necessarily the asshole for leaving, because cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. But the way he did it is questionable.\n\nHe didn't confront her first, communicate, or give her a chance to explain. Instead, he took immediate, drastic action by changing the locks and packing her things. This could be seen as cutting her off without due process. Also, she's financially dependent on him, so leaving her without warning could cause her to drop out of school, which her parents are worried about. \n\nHowever, he's not the asshole because the cheating is a major transgression. But the method of ending the relationship is problematic. He didn't handle it with compassion or communication. The parents' concerns might be valid too, as she's in a vulnerable position. So while the author isn't entirely wrong for ending the relationship, the way he did it makes him partially at fault. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the act of ending the relationship (which is justified) or the manner of doing it (which is harsh) is the focus. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, considering both the cheating and the response, the answer is more on the side of not being the asshole (B), but with the caveat that he should have handled it better. However, the parents' arguments might suggest that the sudden action caused unnecessary hardship. But the core issue is the cheating. So the answer is B.\n"
