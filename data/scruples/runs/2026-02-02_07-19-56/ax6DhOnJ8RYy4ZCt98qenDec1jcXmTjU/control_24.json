I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ghosting their girlfriend after she cheated, especially since she was financially dependent on him. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been together for over seven years and had plans for marriage and kids. The girlfriend quit her job to pursue a medical degree, so she's financially dependent on him. The author found out she cheated by checking her phone, which he might not have a right to do, but he did. Then he changed the locks, packed her stuff, and left her without warning. Now, both families are upset, saying he's being too harsh.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The key points here are the cheating and the abrupt way he ended the relationship. Cheating is a major betrayal, so many people might consider it a valid reason to break up. However, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting, changing locks, not allowing her to retrieve her things\u2014could be problematic. \n\nFinancial dependence is another factor. She's in the middle of her education, so being cut off might have severe consequences for her. The author is angry about supporting her through school, and she might be forced to drop out now. That raises ethical concerns. Even though she cheated, cutting her off without considering her financial stability could be seen as harsh, especially since she's vulnerable. \n\nAlso, checking her phone without consent might be an issue. He used her phone to call his own, leading to the discovery. That could be a privacy violation, which might complicate things. However, he claims he didn't know before, so he might have a reason to check. \n\nThe anger he felt is understandable, but the method of ending the relationship\u2014without communication\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. Ghosting doesn't give her a chance to explain herself or make amends, even if she cheated. But some might argue that cheating is a deal-breaker, making the ghosting a justified reaction. \n\nThe fact that both families are upset suggests there's social pressure to handle it more carefully. They might be right in pointing out the potential consequences for her education. But the author's right to leave because of betrayal is also a valid point. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while cheating is wrong, the way he ended the relationship might have been unnecessarily harsh. However, given the betrayal, he's not entirely in the wrong. The situation is a bit of a toss-up. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might hinge on cultural perspectives on cheating and financial responsibility in relationships. Some would say he's justified in leaving, but the abrupt and cold method is what's problematic. Others might believe that once she cheated, he's not obligated to support her financially anymore. \n\nBut since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer could be A (yes) because he could have handled the situation more compassionately, even if she cheated. Ghosting and cutting her off financially might be seen as inconsiderate. However, B (no) could also be valid because cheating is a legitimate reason to end a relationship. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is that the user is aware he's not an asshole, but questions the method. The way he did it is the problem. So the answer would be A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong because the way he handled it was harsh and didn't consider her situation, even if the cheating was a valid reason.\n"
