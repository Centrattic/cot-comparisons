I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 7+ years, talked about marriage and kids. She left her job to get a medical degree, so he's been supporting her financially. He found out she cheated, which made him angry instead of sad. His response was to change the locks, pack her stuff outside, and send a text saying he doesn't want to see her again. Now both sets of parents are pressuring him to take her back, arguing that it's not worth losing 7 years and her education.\n\nHe's not asking if he's an asshole for leaving, he's concerned about the method. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, in terms of the infidelity, most people would agree that cheating is a major betrayal. The anger is a valid emotional reaction. But the way he handled it\u2014changing locks and removing her belongings without warning\u2014might be the issue. She's financially dependent on him, so abruptly cutting her off could leave her in a difficult situation. While he's right to be upset, the sudden action without allowing her to be part of the conversation might be seen as harsh and potentially unfair, especially considering her current financial state. \n\nAlso, the parents' arguments are about the consequences of his actions (her dropping out), but the cheating is the root cause. However, acting in anger without communication could be viewed as impulsive. The key here is whether he's being reasonable in his approach. While her actions were wrong, his response might be seen as the asshole move because it's cutting her off without any consideration for her immediate needs. But then again, some might argue that after cheating, ending the relationship is justified, even if done abruptly. \n\nThe dilemma is balancing his right to end the relationship on his terms versus the practical impact on her. If she's not working and financially reliant, suddenly changing the locks could be seen as leaving her in a vulnerable position. The question is whether his method was inconsiderate regardless of the reason. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the \"asshole\" factor often relates to the approach taken. Even if the reason is valid, the way of handling it might cross the line. So here, the answer could hinge on whether the action was proportionate and considerate. He might be in the right for ending the relationship, but his method could be considered wrong. So the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because of the way he left, not the decision itself.\n"
