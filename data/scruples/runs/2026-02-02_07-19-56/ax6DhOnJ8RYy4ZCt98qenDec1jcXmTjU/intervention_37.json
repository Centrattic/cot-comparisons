I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who left their girlfriend after she cheated was in the wrong, especially considering how they handled it.\n\nFirst, the cheating part. Cheating is a major betrayal, so the person leaving because of that is understandable. But the way they left is key here. They ghosted her without warning. Ghosting usually means cutting off all communication suddenly, which can be hurtful. In this case, they didn't just ghost but also changed the locks and removed her stuff without notice. That's pretty harsh.\n\nThe girlfriend was financially dependent on him. She quit her job to go to medical school, so she was relying on him for support. By cutting her off suddenly, he's putting her in a tough spot financially. She might have to drop out, which her parents mentioned. That's a serious consequence. Even if she cheated, the way he handled it could be seen as unfair because it affects her future.\n\nHe was angry, which is normal, but acting out in anger by changing locks and packing her things without communication could be seen as excessive. A more measured approach might have been better, even if he wanted to end the relationship. At least allowing her to retrieve her belongings or providing some support might have been more considerate.\n\nThe parents' calls about the situation also show the impact on both families. The man's actions have broader consequences beyond just ending the relationship. While cheating is wrong, the sudden and harsh response might not be the right way to handle it. There's a responsibility to consider the well-being of others, especially when someone is financially dependent on you.\n\nSo, while the cheating isn't his fault, the manner in which he handled the breakup, especially the financial and emotional impact on her, could be seen as the wrong approach. The answer would be A, he's in the wrong for how he handled it, not necessarily the decision to leave because of the cheating.\n"
