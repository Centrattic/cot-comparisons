I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author left their girlfriend without warning after discovering she cheated. The girlfriend is financially dependent on him, and he's been supporting her through her medical degree. He got angry, changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her. Now both families are upset, saying he should take her back because she'll lose her education.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. So, the author has the right to end the relationship. But the way he did it\u2014ghosting, removing her stuff without a conversation\u2014might be the issue. He was angry and acted impulsively. The girlfriend is financially dependent, so leaving her like that could put her in a difficult position, especially since she's in a medical program. The families are concerned about her not being able to continue her education without his support. \n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The main points are: the infidelity justifies ending the relationship, but the method of ending it might be harsh. The author might have been justified in breaking up but not in the abrupt and possibly cruel way he did it. Ghosting and cutting her off without any communication, especially when she's financially dependent, could be seen as selfish, even if he's upset. However, he's also justified in not wanting to be with someone who betrayed him. \n\nThe user is not an asshole for leaving, but the way he handled it might be problematic. The families' arguments are about the consequences for her, not necessarily about the cheating. So, the author might be in the right in ending the relationship but in the wrong in how he did it. The answer depends on whether the method is considered wrong. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nGiven that he's justified in ending the relationship due to cheating, but the way he did it was abrupt and without considering her situation, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the main issue is the method. So maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong because the way he handled it was harsh and possibly selfish, even if the reason is valid. But others might say that once you've decided to break up, you're not obligated to handle it with care if the other person is at fault. The key is that he ghosted and cut her off without communication, which is often seen as inconsiderate, especially when she's financially dependent. So, A.\n"
