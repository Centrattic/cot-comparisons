I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a 7-year relationship with his girlfriend, who he's been planning to marry and have kids with. She quit her job to pursue a medical degree, and he's been supporting her financially with rent, food, tuition, etc. He found out she cheated on him with an ex, which made him angry. Instead of dealing with it more directly, he hired a locksmith to change the locks while she was at class, packed her stuff, and left it outside. He texted her about it and said he doesn't want to see or talk to her again. Now his parents and hers are upset, saying she'll have to drop out of school if he kicks her out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. \n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. The author was clearly hurt and angry, which is understandable. But how he handled it\u2014ghosting, not giving her a chance to explain, removing her without notice\u2014could be problematic. \n\nFinancial dependency complicates things. She might not be able to support herself right now, especially with her medical studies. By cutting off the relationship abruptly, he's leaving her in a vulnerable position. Even if she cheated, he could have given her a chance to address the issue before leaving. \n\nOn the other hand, he did mention he wasn't trying to be cruel but was angry. He might have felt justified in ending the relationship quickly, but the method was harsh. Ghosting and not allowing communication could be seen as inconsiderate, especially considering her financial situation. \n\nAlso, her parents' concern about her dropping out is valid. If she can't afford to continue her education, that's a consequence of his actions. But is that his responsibility? Maybe he should have considered that before ending things so abruptly. \n\nHe could have communicated his decision but allowed her time to adjust, perhaps offering support if possible. Instead, he just left everything in a way that might trap her financially and academically. \n\nSo, while the cheating is her fault, the way he ended the relationship might be inconsiderate. He could have handled it more compassionately, even if he decided to leave. Therefore, I think he's partially at fault for the execution of the breakup, even if the cheating is the root issue. \n\nAnswer A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
