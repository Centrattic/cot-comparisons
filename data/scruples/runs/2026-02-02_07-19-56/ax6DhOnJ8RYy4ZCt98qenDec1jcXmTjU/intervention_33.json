I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the girlfriend cheated, and the boyfriend left her without warning, changed the locks, and packed her stuff out. The key points here are the discovery of cheating, the method of breaking up, and the financial dependency.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major issue in relationships. It's often considered a betrayal, so the reaction might be justified emotionally. However, the way he handled it is important. Ghosting without any communication can be hurtful. Even though he was angry, cutting off contact completely and not giving her a chance to explain or discuss might be seen as harsh. \n\nHe changed the locks while she was at class and didn't allow her to retrieve her belongings himself. This could leave her in a difficult situation, especially since she's financially dependent on him. She might need time to adjust, find new housing, etc. By not letting her come back to get her things, he's adding immediate stress. The parents' concern about her dropping out of school is also valid; she might be in a vulnerable position now.\n\nOn the other hand, he's hurt and angry. The cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship. But the method of ending it\u2014without warning, without communication, and cutting off all contact\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if he doesn't want to be in a relationship anymore, treating her with some dignity and allowing her to retrieve her stuff in a respectful manner could have been better. \n\nFinancial dependence complicates things. If she's out of a job and relying on him, kicking her out abruptly could be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerable state. There's a responsibility there, even if the relationship is ending. But he's also within his rights to end the relationship, especially after betrayal.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a mix. The act of cheating justifies ending the relationship, but the way he did it\u2014without communication, changing locks, ghosting\u2014might be considered inconsiderate and harsh. The parents' concerns about her well-being are valid. He could have handled it more respectfully, perhaps by discussing the breakup first before taking physical steps. Therefore, he might be partially at fault for the handling, even if the reason is understandable.\n"
