I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their girlfriend cheated, and they left her without warning, changing the locks and packing her stuff, even though she's financially dependent on him. The author is angry because they invested a lot into the relationship and felt betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if leaving without warning is the wrong approach. Cheating is a major issue in relationships, and it's understandable that the author would be hurt and angry. However, the way they handled it might be problematic. Ghosting usually means cutting off all contact, but in this case, the author also took physical actions like changing locks, which could leave the ex in a vulnerable position, especially since she's financially dependent on him. \n\nThe girlfriend is in medical school, which she quit her job for. The author has been supporting her financially. By throwing her out, she might not only lose her home but also potentially her education if she can't afford it. The author mentions that both sets of parents are upset, arguing that this is harsh and could ruin her life. \n\nWhile the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship, the method of ending it is where the issue lies. Ending a relationship with 7 years together without any communication or consideration for the other person's circumstances might be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be justified in ending the relationship because of the infidelity, but the abrupt and harsh actions could be seen as the wrong approach, especially since the woman is dependent on him financially. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The infidelity is a valid reason to break up. 2) The way the breakup was handled (without communication, changing locks, packing her stuff) is abrupt and could have serious consequences. 3) The financial dependency complicates things because she might be left unable to support herself, leading to potential hardships.\n\nSo, even though the cheating is on her part, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate and harsh. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the way they ended the relationship. The answer might be yes because they didn't handle it with care, even if the reason for the breakup is valid. But others might argue that after such betrayal, the author is within their rights to end things however they want.\n"
