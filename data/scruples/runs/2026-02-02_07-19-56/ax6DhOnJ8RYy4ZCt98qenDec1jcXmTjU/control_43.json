I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author found out their girlfriend cheated, and they left her without warning, changed the locks, took her stuff out, and ghosted her. The girlfriend is financially dependent on him, and their families are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author discovered cheating, which is a major reason for breaking up. But the way they did it\u2014without warning, changing locks, packing her stuff, and not communicating\u2014is problematic. Cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship, but the method here is harsh, especially since she's financially dependent. Abandoning her without a plan could leave her in a tough spot, possibly forcing her to drop out of school, as the parents mentioned.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable, but cutting off communication entirely and not allowing her to retrieve her belongings might be seen as cruel. Even if the author wanted to end the relationship, there's a more responsible way to handle the logistics. They should have at least given her a chance to get her things or discussed her living arrangements. The fact that they involved a locksmith while she was at class seems a bit underhanded, maybe to avoid confrontation, but it's not considerate.\n\nAlso, the parents' concerns about her dropping out might be valid. The author was supporting her through education, and suddenly removing that support could have serious consequences. However, the cheating is a significant betrayal. The question is whether the author's actions were too harsh given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, cheating is a major transgression, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for breaking up. But the way they did it could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly leaving the other person in a vulnerable position. So maybe the answer is a mix. But the options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nThe main issue is the method. The author is not wrong for breaking up because of cheating, but the execution might be. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the way they did it is considered wrong, then the answer is A. But if the reason (cheating) justifies the method, then B. \n\nIn many cases, people would say that even if someone cheats, you should handle the break up with some consideration, especially if the other person is dependent. So the harsh method might make the author in the wrong. But others might argue that the cheating justifies any action. This is a bit of a gray area, but I think the answer leans towards A because the author didn't handle it responsibly, leaving the other in a bad situation. So the answer would be A.\n"
