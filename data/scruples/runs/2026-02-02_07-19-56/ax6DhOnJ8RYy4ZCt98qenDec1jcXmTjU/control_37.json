I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who left their girlfriend after she cheated is in the wrong, especially with the way they handled it.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 7-year relationship, planning for marriage and kids. She quit her job to pursue a medical degree, and he was supporting her financially. Then she cheated, and he found out through her WhatsApp with an ex. His reaction was anger, not sadness. He changed the locks, packed her stuff, and left without warning. Now the families are upset, saying he's being too harsh because she can't finish her education now.\n\nSo, the key points here. Cheating is a major betrayal. The user argues that he's not the asshole because she cheated. But the way he handled it is questionable. Ghosting and cutting off communication abruptly can be hurtful and might not give her a chance to respond. Also, she's financially dependent on him, so evicting her without notice could leave her in a tough spot. The families are worried about her dropping out of school, which is a valid concern. \n\nHe was angry, but the approach of changing locks and packing stuff without communication could be seen as extreme. Maybe he should have given her a chance to explain, even if he decided to break up. Also, considering her financial situation, he might have a responsibility to help her transition, even if they're not together anymore. \n\nOn the other hand, cheating is a deal-breaker for many. His anger is understandable. But the execution of the breakup is problematic. He didn't provide support for the transition, which could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a mix. He's not wrong for breaking up due to cheating, but the way he did it is. So the answer is A (Yes) because he's in the wrong in terms of how he handled the breakup, not necessarily for breaking up because of cheating. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong overall, considering both the reason and the method, the answer would be A because the method was harsh and possibly unfair.\n"
