I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left their girlfriend without warning after finding out she cheated. The key points here are the sudden departure, the fact that she was financially dependent on them, and the potential consequences for her education.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that it's a valid reason to end a relationship. So the author isn't wrong for breaking up because of the infidelity. The question is more about the method of breaking up.\n\nThe author arranged to change the locks while she was in class, packed her stuff outside, and told her not to contact him. They're angry because they've invested a lot, including financial support for her education. The parents are involved, worried about her dropping out. \n\nNow, the problem here is the abruptness and the lack of communication. Even if the author is justified in ending the relationship due to cheating, ghosting and removing her things without prior discussion can be seen as harsh. Cheating is a personal decision, but the author's actions might have added unnecessary cruelty, especially considering her financial dependence. \n\nFinancial dependence complicates things because she might be in a vulnerable position. Changing the locks and cutting off contact immediately could leave her in a difficult situation, possibly affecting her education. The parents' arguments might carry weight here because they're concerned about her well-being and future. \n\nWhile the author's anger is understandable, ending the relationship in such a way without allowing her to explain or have closure could make the situation worse. The author might be right to end the relationship but wrong in how they handled it. The answer hinges on whether the method was too extreme and inconsiderate of her circumstances. \n\nIn many cases, people might consider that even after cheating, a respectful breakup is important. Ghosting and sudden eviction can be seen as asshole behavior because it's dismissive and could lead to severe personal consequences for the other person. So, the author's actions might be viewed as inconsiderate despite the valid reason for the breakup.\n"
