I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author discovered his girlfriend cheated on him and decided to ghost her without warning, changing the locks and removing her stuff. They've been together for seven years, and she's financially dependent on him, having quit her job to pursue a medical degree.\n\nHmm, first, cheating is a big deal. People often consider that a deal-breaker, so the author's anger is understandable. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting her without explanation, changing the locks, packing her stuff\u2014seems pretty harsh. He didn't confront her first or give her a chance to explain? That could be a problem. Maybe she had reasons she wanted to talk about, or maybe she felt like she had to explain. But by just leaving her without warning, especially when she's financially dependent, he's putting her in a tough spot. She might have nowhere to go and can't afford her education anymore. \n\nThe parents are upset because she'll have to drop out, which is a consequence of his actions. Even if she cheated, cutting her off completely might be seen as overly harsh. There's also the aspect of their long-term relationship\u2014seven years, talking about marriage and kids. Ending it so abruptly could be seen as not being considerate of her situation, even if he's hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified because she broke trust. But the method of ending the relationship seems to lack empathy. Financial dependency adds another layer here. He was supporting her financially, so suddenly cutting that off could leave her in a vulnerable position. Maybe he should have tried to find a way to end the relationship that was less harmful to her, even if he felt betrayed. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of cheating is on her, but the way he ended it could be problematic. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it denies the other person closure. Changing the locks without warning could be seen as extreme. Even if he's angry, the lack of communication or consideration for her circumstances might make him the asshole. So, I think the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
