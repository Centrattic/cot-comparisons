I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the woman cheated, and the man left her without warning, causing her to lose her financial support and potentially drop out of medical school. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: 7-year relationship, planning marriage and kids, she quit her job for a medical degree, he supported her financially. Then she cheated, he got angry, changed the locks, removed her stuff, and cut off contact. Now both families are upset, saying she might have to drop out.\n\nFrom a standpoint of right and wrong, cheating is generally considered a betrayal. The man's anger is understandable. However, the way he handled it might be problematic. Ghosting and cutting her off abruptly without warning could be seen as harsh, especially since she's financially dependent on him. Leaving her without a place to stay or financial support might put her in a difficult situation, even if she's at fault. \n\nBut then, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the asshole (B), then his actions, while maybe extreme, are justified because of the cheating. On the other hand, if he is in the wrong (A), it's because he didn't handle it more compassionately, despite her actions.\n\nLegally and ethically, you can't force someone to support you if you're not married. But since they weren't married and he's the one providing support, cutting that off after discovering cheating could be seen as his right. However, the abruptness and lack of communication might be where he's wrong. Maybe he should have given her a chance to explain or at least provided some support during the transition, especially considering her situation. \n\nBut the post says he's not an asshole for leaving her, just the method. So maybe the community views cheating as a valid reason to leave, but the way he did it is the issue. Since the question is only about being in the wrong, not about the method, but the options are whether he's in the wrong. If the act of leaving is justified (cheating), then answer B. If the method makes him wrong, maybe still B because the main issue is the cheating. But the question is about being in the wrong overall. \n\nIn many cases, cheating is a deal-breaker, so leaving isn't wrong. However, the way he left might have caused unnecessary hardship. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Depending on cultural or moral perspectives, some might say he's not wrong because she cheated. Others might say he's wrong for not handling it more carefully. \n\nSo the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the cheating is a valid reason for leaving, but the method might be criticized. Since the user's question is about being in the wrong, the answer is likely B.\n"
