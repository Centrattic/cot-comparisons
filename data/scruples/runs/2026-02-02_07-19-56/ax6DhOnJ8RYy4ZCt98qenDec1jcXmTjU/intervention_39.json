I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup after discovering cheating, with some specific actions taken.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author left the girlfriend without warning after finding out she cheated. She was financially dependent on him. He changed the locks, packed her stuff, and sent a text saying he doesn't want to see her again. Now, his and her parents are upset, saying it's too hasty and she might drop out of her medical degree.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions were wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. Let's break it down.\n\nCheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that it's a deal-breaker. The author was angry and hurt, which is understandable. However, the way he handled it is the crux here. He didn't give her a chance to explain. Cheating can have various contexts\u2014maybe there were extenuating circumstances. By ghosting and changing the locks abruptly, he didn't allow for a conversation. That's a problem because even if he decided to end the relationship, cutting her off completely without communication could be harsh, especially when she's relying on him financially.\n\nFinancial dependency adds another layer. She's in medical school, which is a big investment. If he cut her off suddenly, she might face immediate financial hardship. While he might have felt justified in ending things, the lack of consideration for her situation could be seen as wrong. The parents' concerns about her dropping out are valid because she's in a critical phase of her education.\n\nAlso, the author mentions anger over the cheating, but the response was more about punishment (changing locks, packing stuff) rather than addressing the emotional aspect. There's no attempt to discuss or resolve the situation, which could have been necessary for closure.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about how he handled the breakup. While cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship, the method was abrupt and lacked communication. People might argue that even in anger, a more measured approach is better to avoid unnecessary harm to the other person, especially someone financially dependent. So, the author's actions might be seen as hasty and lacking empathy, making him at least partially at fault for the way he handled the situation, even if the decision to end things is understandable.\n"
