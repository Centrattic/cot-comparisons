I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who left their girlfriend after she cheated is in the wrong, especially considering the way he did it. The key points here are the cheating, the ghosting, and the financial dependency.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal, and it's understandable that the author felt hurt and angry. Most people would agree that cheating is a deal-breaker. But the way he handled it is where the question lies. He changed the locks without warning, packed her stuff outside, and cut off all contact. That's pretty abrupt. \n\nShe was financially dependent on him, and he's supporting her through medical school. If he just left without giving her a chance to explain, maybe she's in a difficult position. The parents are worried she'll have to drop out, which adds another layer. The author might be right to be angry, but ghosting and cutting her off entirely, especially when she's financially in a vulnerable position, could be seen as harsh. \n\nAlso, even if she cheated, she might need time to transition out of the situation. By locking her out and stopping support abruptly, he's making her life difficult. There's also the aspect of communication\u2014maybe a conversation would have been better than just leaving. So while the cheating justifies the breakup, the method is problematic. He's not an asshole for ending the relationship because of cheating, but the way he did it might be inconsiderate. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the abrupt and potentially harmful way he left, especially considering her financial dependence.\n"
