I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who left their girlfriend after finding out she cheated was in the wrong, especially considering the way he handled it by ghosting and removing her stuff without warning.\n\nFirst, the key points: the couple has been together for 7+ years, talked about marriage and kids. She's financially dependent on him, she quit her job for a medical degree, which he's been supporting. He found out she cheated, which made him angry. Instead of discussing it, he changed the locks, packed her stuff, and sent a text saying he doesn't want to talk again. Now, both families are upset, arguing that she'll have to drop out of school.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nCheating is a major betrayal, so from a moral standpoint, ending the relationship is understandable. However, the way he handled it is questionable. Ghosting, changing locks without notice, and removing her belongings could be seen as extreme, especially since she's in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally. While cheating is a red line, the sudden and harsh action might leave her in a difficult situation, possibly without a support system. \n\nHe argues that he's not an asshole for leaving, but the method is the issue. The problem here is the lack of communication and the potential harm to her well-being. Even if he's justified in ending the relationship, doing it without considering her financial dependence and future (like dropping out of school) might make him at least partially responsible for her situation. \n\nBut on the other hand, the cheating is a valid reason to end things. However, the way he did it could be seen as selfish, not considering her needs during the transition. So it's a mix of both, but since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might swing towards A because of the abrupt and harsh method, even though the reason is valid. \n\nAlternatively, some might say that the cheating justifies the reaction, making him not in the wrong. But the fact that he didn't give her a chance to explain or at least handle it with more compassion could tip the balance towards A. \n\nI think the key here is the approach. While the reason is valid, the execution is where he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
