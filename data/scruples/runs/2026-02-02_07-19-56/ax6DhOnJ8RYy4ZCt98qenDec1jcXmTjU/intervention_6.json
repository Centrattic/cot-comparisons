I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving/ghosting his girlfriend without warning after discovering she cheated. The situation is complex because the girlfriend is financially dependent on him.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal, so the author's anger is understandable. He's been supporting her through school, which adds emotional and financial investment. The sudden lockout and removal of her belongings might be seen as harsh, but maybe he's justified in needing distance after infidelity.\n\nHowever, ghosting without communication can be seen as cruel, especially since she's financially dependent. By cutting her off completely, he might be leaving her in a vulnerable position, potentially forcing her to drop out of school as her parents mentioned. That could have long-term consequences for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he's not seeking reconciliation and wants no contact, so maybe this was a final decision. But the method\u2014changing locks and not providing a way for her to retrieve anything except through her brother\u2014could be seen as not considering her needs. Did he give her enough options? Maybe not. Also, the anger and abrupt action might be seen as impulsive rather than measured.\n\nIn terms of being wrong, it's a mix. Cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship, but the way he handled it might be harsh, especially given her dependency. The author might have been better advised to have a conversation, even if he's not ready for reconciliation, to explain his decision and perhaps offer support to avoid her being in a worse position. So, while the cheating isn't his fault, the lack of communication and potential harm to her situation could make him the asshole in how he handled it.\n"
