I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who left their girlfriend after discovering she cheated is in the wrong, especially considering the way they did it. The key points here are the cheating, the financial dependency, and the abrupt departure.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major breach of trust. Most people would agree that it's a valid reason to end a relationship. So the decision to leave isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way they went about it is questionable. They changed the locks without warning, packed her stuff, and ghosted her. This could be seen as extreme, especially since she's financially dependent and the parents are worried about her education.\n\nFinancial dependency complicates things. She's been studying for a medical degree, which is a big investment. By cutting her off suddenly, he might be causing her significant hardship. Even though she cheated, he was supporting her financially. Ending the relationship abruptly without some consideration for her situation could be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, ghosting without communication isn't healthy. Even if he's angry, completely cutting off contact without allowing her to respond might be inconsiderate. She might need time to adjust, find housing, and manage her studies. The parents' concern about her dropping out is valid, and his actions could have real consequences.\n\nBut, on the other hand, he's hurt and angry. The cheating was a deal-breaker for him, and he's taking a stand. Some might argue that he's within his rights to end the relationship as he sees fit, even if it's abrupt.\n\nBalancing these factors: while the cheating justifies ending the relationship, the method could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially harmful. The financial dependency adds another layer where he might have a responsibility to handle the situation more thoughtfully to avoid leaving her in a vulnerable position.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. He's not the asshole for ending the relationship due to cheating, but the way he did it (ghosting, immediate eviction without communication) could be seen as wrong because of the potential harm caused by her financial dependency and lack of support during the transition. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of how he handled it despite the valid reason.\n"
