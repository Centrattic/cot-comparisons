I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author left his girlfriend without warning after finding out she cheated. The girlfriend was financially dependent on him, and he changed the locks, took her stuff out, and didn't want to communicate anymore. The parents are upset because she might have to drop out of college.\n\nFirst, the cheating part is a major betrayal. Cheating is generally considered a serious issue in relationships. The author had been planning to marry her and have kids, so the trust is broken. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and cutting her off completely without warning\u2014could be problematic. \n\nHe changed the locks while she was at class, which might leave her homeless, especially since she's financially dependent on him. Even though she cheated, abruptly cutting off support without any consideration for her well-being could be seen as harsh. The parents are worried about her dropping out of medical school, which is a big investment and a long path. So the author's actions might have consequences beyond just the relationship.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, the cheating justifies ending the relationship, but the method is questionable. Ghosting and cutting her off without any communication is not healthy. She cheated, but he could have handled it with more empathy, maybe given her a chance to explain or discuss things, even if he decided to leave. Just leaving without a conversation and preventing her from accessing her home might be seen as cruel, especially given her financial situation.\n\nAlso, considering she's in a medical program, if he's forcing her out, she might not be able to continue her studies. That's a significant impact on her future. While she betrayed him, he has a responsibility to consider her circumstances, especially since he was supporting her financially. Maybe he should have provided some means for her to get her things, or allowed her to stay temporarily to finish her education.\n\nSo, while the cheating is her fault, the way he ended things is problematic. He's being abrupt and not allowing communication, which might make him the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
