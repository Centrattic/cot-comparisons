I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend after discovering she cheated. The key points are: they've been in a 7-year relationship, the girlfriend is financially dependent on him, he found out about her cheating, and he ghosted her without warning by changing the locks and removing her stuff.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that's a valid reason to end a relationship. So the decision to leave isn't about the reason being wrong, but how he handled it. He didn't confront her first, didn't give her a chance to explain, just left her without warning. She's financially dependent on him, so suddenly being kicked out could leave her in a tough spot, maybe even force her to drop out of school as her parents mentioned. That's a significant consequence, especially since she's pursuing a medical degree, which is a big commitment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the method he used is wrong. Ghosting and cutting off communication entirely could be seen as harsh. Maybe she needed a chance to explain her actions, or at least to have a discussion. By changing the locks and not allowing her to retrieve her belongings, he's making it impossible for her to transition smoothly. Financial dependence adds another layer here; he was supporting her through school, so his abrupt actions might have left her in a vulnerable position without resources.\n\nOn the other hand, the emotional trauma of cheating can lead someone to act impulsively. He was angry and hurt, which is understandable. But the way he handled it could be considered inconsiderate, especially considering her situation. The parents' concerns about her dropping out might be valid, so not considering her circumstances could be seen as selfish or thoughtless. However, the act of cheating itself is a deal-breaker for many, so leaving isn't inherently wrong.\n\nThe debate here is between the validity of the reason (cheating) versus the method of ending the relationship. The author's actions, while understandable in terms of betrayal, might be seen as inconsiderate due to the financial dependence and the lack of communication. So, while the author isn't necessarily wrong for leaving, the way he did it could be questioned. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the method of ending the relationship is as important as the reason. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, considering both the reason and the method, the consensus might be that he's not the asshole for leaving due to cheating but the method could be improved. However, the key is whether the method justifies being in the wrong. If the focus is on the action rather than the reason, then the answer might be A. But if the reason is a valid excuse for the method, then B. It's a bit of a grey area, but I think the main issue is the method, so he's in the wrong because of how he handled it despite the valid reason.\n"
