I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after finding out she cheated. The situation involves a long-term relationship where he was financially supporting her, and he left abruptly without warning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. Cheating is a major betrayal, so that's a strong point in the author's favor. However, the way he handled it is the main issue here. He changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her, which can be seen as harsh, especially since she's financially dependent on him. \n\nCheating is generally considered a valid reason to end a relationship. But the method of ending it is important. Ghosting and cutting her off completely without communication could leave her in a difficult situation, especially if she can't afford to live on her own or finish her education. The fact that their families are involved and worried about her well-being adds another layer. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable, but acting out of anger without considering her financial situation might be seen as selfish. Even though the cheating is her fault, the way he ended the relationship could be irresponsible. He might be right to end the relationship but wrong in how he did it. He could have given her a chance to explain or at least provided some support during the transition. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. If the question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the relationship, the answer is no (B), because cheating justifies ending it. But if the question is about the method, then he might be in the wrong (A) for not handling it more responsibly. The original question asks if the author is in the wrong overall, considering the way he handled it. Given that the user is concerned about the method (as stated in the meta note), the answer would be A because the way he left her in a vulnerable position is problematic, even if the reason (cheating) is valid.\n"
