I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the girlfriend cheated, and the author reacted by leaving her abruptly without warning, changing the locks, and packing her stuff. The key points here are the infidelity and the manner in which the author handled the breakup.\n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered a serious breach of trust in relationships. The author supports the girlfriend financially, which adds another layer of complexity. She's financially dependent on him and pursuing a medical degree, which is a significant investment. The author's anger is understandable given the betrayal and the time, money, and emotional investment he's put into the relationship.\n\nHowever, the way he handled the breakup raises concerns. Ghosting without any prior communication, changing locks without notice, and packing her belongings could be seen as harsh and potentially harmful. While the cheating justifies ending the relationship, the abruptness and lack of communication might be problematic, especially considering her financial dependency. This could leave her in a vulnerable position, possibly forcing her to drop out of school, as the parents mentioned. The author's actions may not take into account her immediate needs and circumstances, which could be seen as callous.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the asshole for leaving because the cheating was a deal-breaker. The question is whether his method was wrong. While the response was extreme, it's not uncommon for people to act out of anger in such situations. However, the financial dependency complicates things. Even though he's within his rights to end the relationship, the way he did it without considering her financial stability might make him partially at fault for not providing some support or transition period.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, while he has the right to end the relationship, the manner in which he did so could be seen as inconsiderate. The parents' concerns about her dropping out are valid, and the author's actions might exacerbate her financial difficulties. This suggests that while the cheating is her fault, the author's handling of the situation could be criticized for not mitigating the negative consequences she faces as a result.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because, despite the cheating, the abrupt and harsh method of ending the relationship without considering her financial dependency and the potential consequences might be unjustified.\n"
