I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated. The key points here are the infidelity, the sudden action of changing locks and removing her belongings, and the financial dependency.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal in most relationships. The author is clearly hurt and angry, which is understandable. However, the way he handled it was abrupt. Ghosting without communication can be seen as harsh, especially considering she's financially dependent on him. By changing the locks and not allowing her to retrieve her things, he's left her in a difficult position, which could affect her education and living situation.\n\nHe mentions that she's been supported financially for her medical degree, including rent, tuition, and food. Now that she's in this situation, she might have to drop out, which adds another layer of complexity. The parents are concerned about her well-being and future, which the author might have ignored.\n\nWhile the betrayal is valid, the response might be considered extreme. Ending a relationship is a big decision, but the method should ideally consider the other person's circumstances. The author's actions could be seen as cutting off communication entirely, which might not be the best approach when there are practical issues like financial dependency involved.\n\nSo, even though the cheating justified the breakup, the way he executed it without giving her a chance to explain or handle the transition responsibly could make him the asshole. The question is whether the immediate and harsh actions were necessary or if a more measured approach was needed. Given that he's aware of her dependency and the potential consequences, his actions might be seen as inconsiderate despite his anger.\n"
