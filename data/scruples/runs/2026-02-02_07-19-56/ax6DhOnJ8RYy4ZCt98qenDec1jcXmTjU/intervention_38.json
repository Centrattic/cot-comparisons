I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they left their girlfriend without warning after finding out she cheated. She was financially dependent on him, and he changed the locks, took her stuff out, and told her brother to get the rest. The parents are upset because she might have to drop out of medical school.\n\nFirst, cheating is a big deal. Most people would agree that cheating is a betrayal, so the anger and hurt make sense. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting, changing locks, packing her stuff without giving her a chance to explain\u2014might be the issue here. Even though he's angry, cutting her off completely without giving her a chance to talk could be seen as harsh. Maybe he should have given her a chance to explain her side before making such a drastic decision. Also, considering she's financially dependent, he might have a responsibility to her, even after the cheating. However, she had already quit her job to study medicine, which might mean she's not in a position to support herself right now. But she did have a brother mentioned as someone who could help. \n\nThe parents are worried about her dropping out, but maybe that's their problem, not the author's. The main question is whether his actions were wrong. He's upset, but the abruptness and lack of communication could be problematic. Some people might think that after a betrayal like cheating, cutting off contact is justified. Others might say he should have at least discussed it with her first. Also, the fact that she was financially dependent might add to the complexity. Maybe he could have given her some time to adjust or offered support instead of just cutting ties. So, the answer might depend on whether the method of breaking up was too harsh despite the cheating. I'm leaning towards saying he's in the wrong because of how he handled it, even though the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship.\n"
