I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he found out his girlfriend cheated on him after seven years, and he decided to ghost her, change the locks, and pack up her stuff without warning. He's supported her financially during her medical studies. The key points here are the betrayal, the sudden action, and the financial dependency.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major deal-breaker for many people. The author clearly felt betrayed, which is understandable. But the way he handled it was abrupt. Ghosting means cutting off all communication without explanation. Even though he texted her about changing the locks and packing her things, he didn't give her a chance to explain or confront her first. That could be seen as harsh, especially given the long-term relationship and the financial support he provided. \n\nFinancial dependency adds another layer. She's in medical school, which is a long and expensive process. By cutting off support suddenly, he might be putting her financial stability at risk. His parents and hers are worried she might have to drop out, which could be a valid concern. The author's anger is justified from a personal betrayal standpoint, but his actions might not be the most responsible way to handle it. \n\nHe didn't confront her before taking these steps. Maybe she has a reason for the infidelity he doesn't know about. However, the fact that she cheated is a serious breach of trust. But the way he ended the relationship so abruptly without communication could be seen as inconsiderate, especially considering her circumstances. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, her cheating was a major transgression. On the other, his response was impulsive and might have left her in a difficult financial position without a chance to address the situation. The parents' concerns about her education and future might also hold weight. The author's anger is valid, but the method of ending the relationship could be seen as overly harsh and lacking empathy for her financial situation. \n\nTherefore, while the cheating is her fault, the author's actions, though understandable in the heat of anger, might not be the most constructive. He might have a right to end the relationship, but the way he did it could be considered inconsiderate, hence possibly making him the asshole (ITA) in the situation.\n"
