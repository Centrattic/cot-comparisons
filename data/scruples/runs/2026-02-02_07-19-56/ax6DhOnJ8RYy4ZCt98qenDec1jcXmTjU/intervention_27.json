I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author discovered his girlfriend cheated on him after being together for 7 years. She was financially dependent on him, and he left her without warning by changing the locks and removing her stuff. He's angry because she cheated with an ex, and he's now facing pressure from both families to reconcile.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. Cheating is a major betrayal, so the decision to leave is understandable. But the way he handled it\u2014without any prior communication, just ghosting and removing her belongings\u2014might be problematic, especially considering her financial dependence. She might be in a vulnerable position now, potentially unable to continue her education due to the sudden separation. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as cutting her off completely without giving her a chance to explain or address the situation. Even if the cheating is unforgivable, the method of ending the relationship could be seen as harsh. Financial dependency adds another layer here because it's not just about the relationship but also about her ability to support herself now. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt justified in his anger and might believe that the betrayal was so severe that there was no need for further discussion. However, abruptly cutting her off without support could exacerbate her situation, making it harder for her to transition. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If being in the wrong means that his actions were unnecessarily harsh or failed to consider her financial dependency, then A might be the answer. But if the betrayal justifies his actions, then B. However, the key here is the method he used. Even if the decision to leave is acceptable, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and removing her stuff without a conversation\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the fact that she's financially dependent on him means that his actions might have left her in a worse position than if he had approached it differently, perhaps offering some support or a transition period.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because of how he handled the situation, not necessarily the decision to leave. The way he cut her off without any communication or support is likely the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
