I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author left his girlfriend of seven years after discovering she cheated. He changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her. The girlfriend is financially dependent on him, and her parents are pressuring him to take her back. The author is conflicted about the method he used\u2014whether he was wrong to leave without a warning or to handle it so abruptly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The cheating is a major betrayal, which many people would see as a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the way he handled it is questionable. Cheating is a deal-breaker for many, so the decision to leave isn't necessarily wrong. But the method\u2014changing locks without notice, packing her belongings, and ghosting\u2014might be problematic.\n\nFinancial dependence is another factor. The girlfriend is in medical school, relying on him for tuition and living expenses. By cutting her off suddenly, she might face significant hardship, even if she's at fault. The parents' argument that she might have to drop out adds another layer of complexity. The author might not have considered the consequences of his actions beyond his personal feelings.\n\nEmotionally, the author was angry and hurt, which can cloud judgment. Acting impulsively in such a state can lead to decisions that seem harsh in hindsight. While the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship, the abrupt and hostile manner could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given her financial situation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author has the right to end the relationship on his terms, especially after such a betrayal. The question is whether the method of ending it is wrong. Ghosting, in general, is often criticized because it leaves the other person in the dark and can be emotionally damaging. In this case, the author took it a step further by removing her things and changing locks, which could be seen as cutting off all contact without allowing her to respond or explain.\n\nThe girlfriend's infidelity is a significant issue, but the author's response might have been too harsh given her dependent status. There's a balance between protecting one's own feelings and considering the other person's well-being. The author might have been within his rights to end the relationship, but the method used could be seen as unnecessarily cruel.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while cheating is a major issue, the way the author handled the aftermath might be considered too extreme. Providing some form of communication, even if it's to say the relationship is over, is usually advised. The sudden removal of her belongings without prior notice could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a long-term relationship where there's a history of shared responsibilities.\n\nSo, evaluating both sides: the author has a valid reason to end the relationship due to cheating, but the manner in which he did so may be inconsiderate and potentially harmful. The key here is the method of ending the relationship rather than the reason. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of how he handled the situation, despite the valid reason.\n"
