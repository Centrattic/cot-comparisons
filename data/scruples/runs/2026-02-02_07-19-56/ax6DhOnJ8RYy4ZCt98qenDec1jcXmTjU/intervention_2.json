I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: A guy and his girlfriend have been together for over seven years, planning for marriage and kids. She left her job to pursue a medical degree, and he was financially supporting her. Then he found out she cheated on him with an ex. Instead of discussing it, he changed the locks, packed up her stuff, and left without notice. Now his parents and hers are upset, saying he's throwing away the relationship over cheating, and she might have to drop out of school.\n\nThe author believes he's not an asshole but is concerned about how he handled it. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, cheating is a major betrayal. It's understandable that he's angry and wants to end the relationship. However, the way he ended it\u2014ghosting, not giving her a chance to explain, and cutting her off financially without warning\u2014could be problematic. She's dependent on him financially, and suddenly cutting her off might leave her in a difficult position, especially with her education. \n\nEven though cheating is a valid reason to break up, the method here is abrupt and doesn't consider her well-being. She might not have resources to live on her own, and the parents' concern about her dropping out is valid. By not allowing her to retrieve her belongings through a mutual acquaintance, he's making it harder for her to transition. \n\nBut on the other hand, he's justified in ending the relationship due to the betrayal. The anger and sudden action might be impulsive, but the core issue is her cheating. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether the manner of the breakup is considered wrong despite the reason being valid. While cheating is a dealbreaker, the execution might be harsh. Ethically, even if you decide to end a relationship due to betrayal, it's generally advised to communicate directly and compassionately, especially when someone is financially dependent. Ghosting and cutting off support abruptly could be seen as inconsiderate, even if justified.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong not for the decision to end the relationship but for how he handled it. The wrong here is more about the method rather than the reason. So the answer would be A (Yes), but I need to check the options again. The user says answer A for yes, B for no. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the method, the answer is A.\n"
