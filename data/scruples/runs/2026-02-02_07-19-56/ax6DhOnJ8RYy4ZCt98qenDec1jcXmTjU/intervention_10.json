I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who left their girlfriend after she cheated was in the wrong, especially regarding how they handled it. The person changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her without warning. The girlfriend was financially dependent on him.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major issue in relationships. The author discovered the infidelity and felt betrayed, which is understandable. However, the way he handled it seems harsh. Ghosting and cutting her off completely might be seen as extreme, especially since she's financially dependent. By changing the locks and not giving her a chance to explain, he might have left her in a difficult position, possibly affecting her education and financial stability. His parents and hers are concerned about her dropping out, which adds another layer of emotional and practical consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's anger is valid. After seven years and planning for a future together, betrayal can be devastating. But the method of breaking up\u2014without communication\u2014might be seen as cold. The question is whether the author's actions were justified. While cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship, the manner of ending it without allowing her to respond or discuss could be problematic. It might be considered selfish if he didn't consider her situation, especially her financial dependence and education. However, he's also justified in protecting his own emotional well-being.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a right to end the relationship? Yes, due to cheating. Was the method appropriate? Possibly not, because of the lack of communication and the suddenness, which could leave her in a worse position. However, he might not be the asshole for ending it, just the approach being flawed. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is more nuanced. So, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because of how he handled it, not the act of ending the relationship itself.\n"
