I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their girlfriend after she cheated. The situation is a seven-year relationship where the GF is financially dependent, having quit her job for a medical degree. The author found out about the cheating via her phone, got angry, changed locks, took her stuff, and ghosted her.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal, so the anger and wanting to end the relationship makes sense. But the way he handled it\u2014changing locks without warning, packing her stuff, and cutting off communication entirely\u2014could be seen as harsh. He didn't give her a chance to explain or confront her directly. Ghosting is usually seen as an immature way to end a relationship, even after betrayal. Also, she's financially dependent, so leaving her without support might cause her to drop out of school, which adds ethical concerns about her well-being.\n\nHe mentions that his and her parents are upset, which might indicate that others see the situation as more nuanced. The author believes he's not an asshole, but the method of ending the relationship is questionable. The key points here are: 1) the right to end a relationship due to cheating, 2) the manner of doing so (ghosting, cutting off without discussion), and 3) the financial dependency and potential consequences for her.\n\nCheating is a valid reason to break up, but the way it's handled can affect whether someone is seen as an asshole. Ghosting often lacks accountability and empathy. Additionally, taking her belongings without her presence or input could be seen as controlling or dismissive. The author didn't consider her financial situation's impact, which might make him look self-centered. So, while the cheating justifies ending the relationship, the abrupt and cutting-off method could make him the asshole in terms of how he handled it.\n"
