I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author left their girlfriend after discovering she cheated. They were in a 7-year relationship, planned marriage and kids, and the girlfriend was financially dependent on him. She quit her job to pursue a medical degree, and he was supporting her with rent, food, tuition, etc. When he found out about the cheating, he got angry and decided to ghost her without a conversation. He changed the locks, took her stuff out, and texted her to have her brother come get the rest. His parents and hers are upset, saying it's harsh and she might have to drop out of school.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cheating is a major betrayal. Emotionally, the author is hurt and angry, which is understandable. However, the way he handled the situation might be problematic. Ghosting without explanation can leave someone in a difficult position, especially when they're financially dependent. She's in the middle of a medical degree, which is a long and expensive commitment. By cutting off support suddenly, she might lose her housing, which could force her to drop out. That's a serious consequence.\n\nAlso, the author didn't even give her the chance to explain. Maybe there's more to the story? Cheating is a big deal, but not talking to her at all might prevent her from apologizing or explaining her actions. He changed the locks and removed her belongings without a conversation. That seems abrupt and potentially cruel, especially if she's left without a place to go and in a vulnerable position.\n\nOn the other hand, the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship. The author might feel that he's been wronged and wants no contact. But the method of ending it\u2014without warning, without communication\u2014could be seen as harsh. There's a difference between ending a relationship and doing so in a way that leaves the other person in dire straits. The fact that she's financially dependent adds another layer. He should have considered how to support her during the transition, even if they're ending the relationship. Abandoning her like that might be seen as irresponsible, especially given the years of support he's already provided.\n\nAlso, the parents' concerns might have some merit. She's in a critical phase of her education. If she's forced to drop out, that's a significant loss for her. The author might be right to end the relationship, but the way he did it could be seen as inconsiderate and lacking empathy. Even if he's angry, there's a responsible way to handle the separation, ensuring she has time to find a place to live and adjust financially.\n\nSo, while the cheating justifies the breakup, the method of doing it without support or communication might make him the asshole in this situation. The answer would depend on whether the means of ending the relationship were acceptable. Since he left her abruptly without explanation and in a financially vulnerable position, he's in the wrong in terms of how he handled it, even if the decision to break up was justified.\n"
