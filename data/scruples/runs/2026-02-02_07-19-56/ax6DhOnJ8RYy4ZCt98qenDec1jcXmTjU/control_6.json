I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the girlfriend cheated, and the author left her without warning after finding out. They also mention that she's financially dependent on him and that he changed the locks and packed her stuff out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman cheated, which is a major breach of trust. The author was supporting her financially through her education, which adds another layer of complexity. The way he ended the relationship was abrupt\u2014he changed the locks, removed her belongings, and didn't give her a chance to explain. While the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship, the method he used might be problematic.\n\nFinancial dependency is a big factor here. If she's financially dependent, cutting her off without warning could leave her in a difficult position. The parents are worried she might have to drop out of her medical program, which is a significant investment. The author's anger is understandable, but the sudden and harsh action might be seen as excessive, especially without allowing her to explain her side or without considering her circumstances.\n\nAlso, communication is important in such situations. Ghosting or leaving without a proper conversation can be hurtful and might not address the issues adequately. Even though the author is justified in feeling wronged, the approach could have been more considerate. Maybe a direct conversation to address the cheating and then making the decision to leave would have been better, rather than an impulsive, physical removal of her belongings.\n\nSo, while the cheating is her fault, the way the author handled the breakup might be seen as overly harsh. He could have taken steps to protect his own well-being, like giving her a chance to explain, ensuring her financial stability during the transition, or at least having a conversation before cutting her off completely. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of her situation, even though he's not entirely at fault for ending the relationship because of the infidelity.\n"
