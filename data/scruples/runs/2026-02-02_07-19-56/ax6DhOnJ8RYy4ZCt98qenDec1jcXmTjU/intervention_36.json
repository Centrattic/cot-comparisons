I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he discovered his girlfriend cheated on him, and he decided to ghost her without warning. He changed the locks, took her stuff out, and texted her. Now he's getting pressure from both families to reconcile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. He left her without a warning, which could be seen as harsh. She's financially dependent on him, so cutting her off like that might leave her in a tough spot. The argument the families are making is that she could drop out of school if she loses his support. That's a valid concern because she's in a medical program, which is a big investment.\n\nOn the other hand, cheating is a serious betrayal, and he's hurt. His reaction is understandable emotionally, but the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and cutting her off abruptly\u2014might be the problem. He didn't give her a chance to explain or talk things out, which can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is valid.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the author himself isn't sure. He knows he's not an asshole for leaving but is concerned about the method. So, the main issue is the method of ending the relationship, not the reason. Cheating is a deal-breaker for many, but the abruptness and the way he handled the separation, especially considering her dependency, could be seen as wrong.\n\nI should also think about the emotional aspect. She cheated, which is a major betrayal, but cutting her off without a conversation might prevent her from explaining her side. Also, by taking away her support system suddenly, he's putting her in a vulnerable position, which might be seen as cruel, even if he's angry.\n\nSo, while the reason (cheating) is valid, the method (ghosting, sudden removal without discussion) might be the issue. The author is in the wrong for how he handled the breakup rather than the decision to leave itself. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
