I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend without warning after finding out she cheated. The situation is that they've been together for 7+ years, she's financially dependent on him because she quit her job to pursue a medical degree, and he found out she cheated. He got angry, changed the locks, packed her stuff, and sent it out, told her he doesn't want to see her again. Now his parents and hers are upset, saying he's being too harsh, and that she might have to drop out of school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Cheating is a serious issue in relationships. If someone discovers their partner has cheated, they're within their right to end the relationship. However, the way he went about it is the main concern here. He didn't communicate with her directly, instead changing the locks and removing her belongings without giving her a chance to explain. That's where the potential problem lies.\n\nFinancial dependence is another factor. She's relying on him for tuition, rent, etc. By cutting her off suddenly, he's putting her in a difficult situation, especially since she's in medical school. That's a big commitment, and if she can't continue, she might lose years of education and financial investment. But, she was the one who was cheating, so maybe he's justified in his anger and decision to leave.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, cheating is a deal-breaker for many, so ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, the method of doing so without giving her a chance to explain or negotiate is questionable. Ghosting and sudden removal of belongings might be seen as harsh, especially since she's financially dependent. He could be accused of not handling the situation with care, possibly exacerbating her financial difficulties.\n\nAlso, consider the fact that he didn't give her a chance to respond. Maybe there was a reason behind her cheating, but he didn't give her the opportunity to explain. That could be seen as unfair. However, he might not trust her explanation given the act of cheating itself.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on both families. His parents and hers are involved, and they think he's being too harsh. But the author's priority might be his own emotional well-being after betrayal. However, his actions have consequences for her, which could make him responsible for her potential drop-out, which some might see as irresponsible.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author's decision to end the relationship is understandable, but the way he did it\u2014without communication, suddenly cutting her off financially and access to her belongings\u2014might be considered inconsiderate. He's not the asshole for ending the relationship because cheating is a valid reason, but he could have handled it more compassionately. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for ending it, but the method could be improved. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the method of ending the relationship is wrong. Since there's no legal obligation to support someone you're not married to, but morally, maybe he should have had a discussion before cutting her off completely. So, some might say he's in the wrong for not handling it better, others might say he has the right to end things as he did. The answer isn't black and white, but I think the key is that while the cheating is a valid reason, the abrupt and uncommunicative approach is problematic. Therefore, the answer might be that he's not the asshole (B), but with the caveat that he could have approached it better.\n"
