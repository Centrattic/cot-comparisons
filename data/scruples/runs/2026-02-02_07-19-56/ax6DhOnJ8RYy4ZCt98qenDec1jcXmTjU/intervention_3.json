I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author discovered their girlfriend cheated, and they decided to leave her abruptly without much communication. They changed the locks, took her stuff out, and texted her. Now, their families are concerned because the girlfriend is financially dependent and might have to drop out of medical school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author found out about the cheating, which is usually considered a valid reason to end a relationship. But the way they ended it was quite harsh\u2014ghosting, changing locks, not giving a chance to explain. The girlfriend is in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally.\n\nCheating is a deal-breaker for many people, so the author's anger and decision to leave isn't inherently wrong. However, the method of breaking up is questionable. Ghosting without explanation can cause emotional distress. Also, removing someone from a shared home without warning could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if they can't support themselves. The author's actions might have immediate negative consequences on her education and well-being.\n\nBut then, the author is upset and angry. They might feel justified in their reaction because of the betrayal. The fact that they've been together a long time and talked about marriage adds to the emotional weight. However, cutting off contact without allowing her to explain her side might leave unresolved issues. Also, taking her stuff without prior discussion could be seen as impulsive.\n\nThe family's concern is valid too. She might not have the financial means to continue her studies without support. The author might be adding to her hardship by making an abrupt exit. But the author is also within their rights to end the relationship if they choose, even if it's sudden.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author was the primary financial supporter, there might be some obligation to consider her situation. However, once the relationship ends, that support isn't a legal requirement. Emotionally, though, it's a different story. The author's actions, while understandable in their anger, might not be the most compassionate approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They made a decision that's personal and based on cheating, which is a red line for many. But the execution was harsh. The key points are the lack of communication and the abruptness. If the author had at least given her a chance to explain or discussed the situation calmly, the approach would be better. But as it stands, the method is problematic, even if the reason is valid. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in terms of how they handled it, even if their decision to leave isn't.\n"
