I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is the asshole for ghosting his girlfriend after discovering she cheated, especially since she's financially dependent on him. \n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. If someone cheats, it's understandable that the other person would feel hurt and want to end the relationship. But the way the author handled it is a problem. He changed the locks without warning, packed her stuff, and left it outside. He didn't communicate properly, which could be seen as harsh. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure.\n\nAlso, his girlfriend is financially dependent on him. She's in medical school, which is a significant investment. By cutting off support suddenly, he might be causing her financial instability, which could force her to drop out. That's a serious consequence. While she cheated, the author's actions could be seen as not considering her situation, especially since they had long-term plans together.\n\nHe's angry, which is a valid emotion, but acting out of anger without thinking through the consequences might make his actions more problematic. His parents and her parents are concerned about the suddenness and the impact on her education. The author argues he's not an asshole because he's leaving her, but the method is the issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, cheating is a deal-breaker for many. But how you break up matters too. The author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is justified. There's a balance between protecting his own well-being and being fair to her. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of both. The cheating is her fault, but his reaction could be seen as overly harsh. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the way he handled it, not necessarily the decision to end the relationship. However, some might argue that B (No) because he has the right to end things if he's been betrayed. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just if he's an asshole. The suddenness and lack of communication could make him at fault in terms of handling the situation poorly.\n"
