I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author discovered their girlfriend cheated, and then decided to ghost her and kick her out without warning. They changed the locks, packed her stuff, and left it outside. The main points to consider are the right to leave after infidelity, the method of doing so, and the financial dependency aspect.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal, and it's understandable that the author felt hurt and angry. Most people would agree that leaving a cheating partner is not inherently wrong. However, the way the author handled it might be questionable. Ghosting without any communication could be seen as harsh, especially given that the girlfriend is financially dependent on them. By abruptly cutting off contact and removing her from the home, the author is leaving her in a vulnerable position. This could lead to her losing her education, as her parents mentioned, which adds a layer of responsibility the author might have.\n\nThe author claims to know they aren't an asshole for leaving, but the issue is the method. Even though the relationship might be over, the sudden and unilateral action could be considered inconsiderate. The financial support they provided over seven years creates a complex dynamic. While the author has the right to end the relationship, doing so in a way that financially destabilizes their partner could be seen as wrong, especially if there's no prior discussion or provision for her to transition out of that dependency.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend cheated, which is a valid reason to end the relationship. The author's anger is justified, and they might feel that any further communication would be too painful. However, the key point is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain or resolve the situation. There's no mention of a confrontation or discussion where she could defend her actions or they could negotiate the separation terms. The abruptness and lack of communication might be where the author is in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while the decision to end the relationship might be understandable, the method of doing so without prior communication and leaving her in a precarious financial situation could be seen as inconsiderate and thus, the author is in the wrong. So, the answer would be A.\n"
