I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person has been in a 7+ year relationship with their girlfriend. They were planning to get married and have kids. The girlfriend quit her job to pursue a medical degree, which the author has been financially supporting, including rent, food, tuition, etc. Recently, the author found out that the girlfriend cheated on them with an ex-boyfriend from high school. The author is angry, not just sad, because of the investment they've made and the betrayal. Instead of confronting her, they changed the locks, packed her stuff, and left it outside. They sent a text saying they don't want to see her again. Now both families are contacting the author, saying that her cheating was wrong but the author's reaction is too harsh, leading to her possibly having to drop out of school.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want others' opinions.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The key points are:\n\n1. Discovery of cheating: Cheating is generally considered a serious betrayal. The author's reaction is anger, which is understandable.\n\n2. Financial dependency: The author was supporting the girlfriend financially. This adds a layer of complexity because she may be in a vulnerable position now. However, the cheating is the immediate cause of the breakup.\n\n3. The way the author ended the relationship: They didn't confront her directly but instead changed the locks and left her stuff without warning. They didn't communicate directly, just via text. This is the part that's being questioned\u2014was the method of ending the relationship inappropriate?\n\n4. The author's refusal to engage further: They don't want to see or speak to her ever again. The families are concerned about the girlfriend's education and well-being.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions in handling the breakup were wrong, not necessarily the decision to end the relationship. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong because of the method used.\n\nPossible angles to consider:\n\n- The author has the right to end the relationship if they've been cheated on. Cheating is a common reason for breakups.\n\n- However, the method of ending it\u2014ghosting, changing locks, not giving her a chance to respond\u2014could be seen as harsh. Especially considering her financial dependency, which might leave her in a difficult situation.\n\n- The author's anger is understandable, but perhaps the lack of communication or a more abrupt exit could be seen as cutting her off without support, which could be irresponsible given the financial support they provided.\n\n- The families' concerns about her dropping out of school and the immediate removal of her belongings might indicate that the author's actions could have severe consequences for her, which could be seen as callous.\n\n- On the other hand, the author might feel justified in cutting ties after such betrayal and not wanting to engage further.\n\nBut in terms of ethics, is the author in the wrong? Well, in many cultures, after a betrayal, the person wronged can choose to end the relationship. However, the manner in which it's done can affect whether someone is considered \"the asshole.\" Ghosting without communication is often frowned upon because it can be emotionally damaging. However, in this case, the author did provide a way for her to retrieve her belongings through her brother, so there's some consideration there.\n\nThe fact that the author was financially supporting her adds another layer. If she's now in a position where she can't continue her education because of this abrupt exit, maybe the author should have considered how to transition her support or give her time to adjust. But the author might also argue that they were done supporting her after the betrayal.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, if the girlfriend was living in their property, changing the locks without notice could be illegal in some places, depending on local laws. Evicting someone suddenly without following legal procedures might be a problem. But this might not be the main ethical consideration here.\n\nEthically, the question is about whether the author's actions were wrong. The cheating is the catalyst, but the method of ending the relationship is the focus. If the author had a right to end the relationship, but the way they did it caused unnecessary hardship, that could be seen as inconsiderate or wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, while understandable given the cheating, might be considered harsh and inconsiderate, especially given the financial dependency. The author might not be wrong for ending the relationship but could be in the wrong for how they handled it, particularly the abruptness and lack of communication. However, the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but others might argue differently.\n\nI think the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the way they ended things was abrupt and didn't consider her situation, despite the cheating. But others might say the cheating makes the author right to end it, but the method is what's being questioned here. The question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong regarding the way they left. Since they ghosted her and removed her belongings without prior discussion, that's generally considered wrong, especially if it leaves the other person in a worse position. So the answer is A.\n"
