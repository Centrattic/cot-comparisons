I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their girlfriend after discovering she cheated is in the wrong. The key points here are that the relationship lasted over seven years, they discussed marriage and having kids, and she's financially dependent on him. He found out she cheated and reacted by changing the locks, packing her stuff, and cutting off contact. Both families are upset, saying he's being too harsh.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. It's a valid reason for ending a relationship. However, the way he handled it is questionable. Ghosting without explanation, even after cheating, might be seen as harsh. But she was cheating, so he's justified in ending things. The issue is the method\u2014abruptly leaving without communication. While the cheating is a deal-breaker, the sudden removal of her belongings and cutting off contact entirely might be considered inconsiderate, especially since she's dependent on him financially and might struggle. \n\nHe changed the locks without notice, which could leave her homeless. Even if she cheated, forcing someone out without giving her time to adjust could be seen as cruel. The parents' concern about her dropping out of school is valid. He might have been angry, but ensuring she has time to transition responsibly is important. So, while the cheating justifies breaking up, the way he did it might make him seem more at fault. So, AITA-wise, he's not entirely wrong, but his approach could be better. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer is A (yes) because of the method, even if the reason is valid.\n"
