I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who left his girlfriend without warning after discovering she cheated on him. They've been together for 7 years, and she's financially dependent on him because she quit her job to pursue a medical degree. He found out she cheated, got angry, changed the locks, took her stuff out, and texted her he doesn't want to talk anymore. His parents and hers are upset, saying she'll have to drop out if he kicks her out.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. The main points here are cheating and the way he ended the relationship. Cheating is generally a dealbreaker for many people, so his response to it is understandable. However, the method he used to end the relationship is key here. He didn't confront her first; he just left without warning. He changed the locks and removed her belongings without giving her a chance to explain or discuss. That could be seen as harsh, especially since she's financially dependent on him. If he cut her off completely without any communication, that could leave her in a difficult situation, possibly leading to her dropping out of school, as the parents mentioned.\n\nOn one hand, he has the right to end the relationship if she cheated. On the other hand, the way he did it might be considered inconsiderate or even cruel, given her financial dependence. He might be seen as abandoning her in a way that's irresponsible. Even if he's angry, handling it by ghosting and cutting her off immediately without any communication could be viewed as wrong, especially considering the long-term consequences for her.\n\nHowever, some might argue that after cheating, he's justified in ending the relationship on his terms, especially if he's hurt and doesn't want to engage. The question is whether the method was too abrupt and lacked consideration for her circumstances. The fact that she's financially dependent adds another layer of responsibility. He might have a duty to at least ensure she's in a stable position before ending the relationship, rather than leaving her in a situation where she might lose her education.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He's not wrong for ending the relationship due to cheating, but the way he did it could be problematic. The key issue is the lack of communication and the immediate removal of her belongings, which could be seen as inconsiderate. So, depending on the perspective, he might be in the wrong for how he handled it, even if the reason is justified.\n"
