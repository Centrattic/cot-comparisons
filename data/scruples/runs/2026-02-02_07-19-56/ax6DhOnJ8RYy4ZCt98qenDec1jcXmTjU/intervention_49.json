I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated. The key points here are the cheating, the financial dependency, and the way he ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that it's a deal-breaker. The author was angry and hurt, which is understandable. But the way he handled it\u2014changing the locks without warning, packing her stuff, and cutting off communication\u2014might be the issue. Even though the cheating is a valid reason to break up, the method could be problematic. Ghosting, especially without any discussion, can be seen as harsh, even if the person is at fault. \n\nThe girlfriend was financially dependent on him, which adds another layer. If she's now forced to drop out of her medical program due to being kicked out suddenly, that's a serious consequence. The parents are concerned about her education and well-being. The author might not have considered her ability to support herself after the breakup. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact of his actions: not giving her a chance to explain or discuss things. Maybe there was a reason behind the cheating, or maybe she wanted to apologize. By cutting her off completely, he denied her that opportunity. \n\nWhile the cheating justifies ending the relationship, the abruptness and lack of communication could be where he's in the wrong. It's important to respect someone's autonomy and dignity, even when ending a relationship. So, the answer might be that he's in the wrong for how he handled it, despite the valid reason for breaking up.\n"
