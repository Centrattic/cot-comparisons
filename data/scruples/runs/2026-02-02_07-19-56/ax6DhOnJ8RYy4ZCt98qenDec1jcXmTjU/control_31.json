I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about a guy who left his girlfriend after discovering she cheated on him. They've been together for seven years, talked about marriage and kids. She quit her job to pursue a medical degree, so she's financially dependent on him. He found out she cheated with an ex, which made him angry rather than sad. He changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her. Now both families are calling him, saying it's wrong to throw away seven years, and she might have to drop out of school because of this.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. That's a common reason for breaking up. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting, changing locks without notice, packing her stuff\u2014seems harsh. She's dependent on him financially, so cutting off support might leave her in a tough spot. The families are worried about her education and well-being. \n\nHe says he's angry, not heartbroken. That anger led to an abrupt decision. But maybe he should have considered the consequences. Even though cheating is a valid reason to break up, the method of doing it without communication could be problematic. She might need time to adjust, find her own place, handle school. By cutting her off completely, he's making it harder for her. \n\nBut on the other hand, he's not wrong for ending the relationship. Cheating is a deal-breaker for many. The question is if the way he ended it makes him the asshole. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person in the dark. Even if you're angry, giving some explanation or allowing a discussion might be better. But he did text her about changing the locks and offered to have her brother get the remaining stuff. Maybe that's the best he could do given his anger.\n\nThe key points are: cheating is a valid reason, but the abruptness and lack of communication might be the issue. Also, considering her financial dependency, he could have been more thoughtful about the transition. Maybe he should have discussed things before leaving, especially since she's in a vulnerable position. So, even though he's justified in ending the relationship, the way he did it might be inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the method, but some might argue B (No) because the cheating justifies it. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for the way he handled it. The meta says he knows he's not an asshole for leaving, but the way he did it. So maybe the answer is A because the way he did it is considered wrong, despite the justification.\n"
