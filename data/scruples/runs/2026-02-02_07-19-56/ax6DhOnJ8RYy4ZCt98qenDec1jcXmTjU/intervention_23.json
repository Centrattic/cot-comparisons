I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who left his girlfriend after she cheated was in the wrong, especially regarding how he handled it.\n\nFirst, the cheating part. Cheating is a major betrayal in a relationship. Most people would agree that the guy has every right to end the relationship because of that. So, in terms of the reason for breaking up, he's not in the wrong. But the question is about the way he did it\u2014leaving without warning, changing the locks, packing her stuff, and not communicating properly.\n\nHe mentions that she's financially dependent on him and that she's in medical school. Cheating is a deal-breaker, but cutting her off abruptly without any notice could leave her in a really tough spot financially and academically. She might not be able to continue her studies if she's suddenly evicted and without support. That part seems harsh. Even though she cheated, the way he handled the separation might be considered inconsiderate, especially given her dependent situation. \n\nThe parents are concerned because of the suddenness leading to her having to drop out. While her actions were wrong, the author's reaction could be seen as overly punitive. Ending a relationship is one thing, but cutting someone off without any transition plan when they're relying on you for their financial stability and education is another. There's a responsibility there, even if the relationship is ending. \n\nHe was angry, which is understandable, but acting out of anger without considering the consequences for her might be where he's in the wrong. The question is whether the method of leaving is acceptable. Ghosting and cutting her off completely, especially with her financial dependence, could be seen as not taking responsibility for the situation he helped create. \n\nSo, while the cheating justifies the breakup, the abrupt and uncommunicative way he handled it, especially given her financial status, could mean he's in the wrong in terms of how he treated her during the separation. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the method, even though the reason is valid.\n"
