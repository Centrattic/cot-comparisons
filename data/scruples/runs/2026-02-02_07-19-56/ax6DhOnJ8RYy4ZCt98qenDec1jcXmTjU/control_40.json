I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who left his girlfriend is in the wrong, given the circumstances. He found out she cheated, which is a major betrayal. He's angry because he's been financially supporting her for years towards her medical degree, and he's cutting things off abruptly.\n\nFirst, cheating is a big deal. Most people would agree that infidelity is a serious issue that can end a relationship. The author's reaction is understandable in terms of hurt and anger. But did he handle it right? He ghosted her without warning, changed the locks, packed her stuff, and sent a text. This is a sudden and harsh approach. \n\nGhosting, especially without communication, can be seen as inconsiderate. Even if she cheated, cutting off contact completely without discussion might leave her in a difficult spot, especially since she's financially dependent on him. He's making her drop out of school if she has to leave suddenly. His parents and her parents are concerned about her education and financial situation. \n\nThe author's anger is valid, but the way he acted might be seen as cruel. Ending a relationship after seven years isn't just about the cheating; it's also about the abruptness and lack of consideration for her well-being. He could have chosen a more respectful way to end things, even if he's angry. \n\nSo, while the cheating justifies the breakup, the method he used is questionable. The answer might be that he's not the asshole (B), but his actions could still be seen as wrong due to the ghosting and lack of communication. However, some might argue that after cheating, the right to be called an asshole is lessened. It's a bit of a nuance. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that he did leave her without support when she's dependent on him, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the abruptness and potential harm caused. But others might say B because cheating is a dealbreaker. Hmm, this is tricky. The key here is the method, not the reason. Since the question is about the wrongness, the way he handled it is the focus. So maybe A. But I need to decide.\n"
