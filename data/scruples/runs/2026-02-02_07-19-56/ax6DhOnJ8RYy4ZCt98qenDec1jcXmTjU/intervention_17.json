I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person who wrote the post left their girlfriend after finding out she cheated. The main question is whether they're in the wrong, especially considering how they handled it.\n\nFirst, cheating is a serious issue in relationships. Most people would agree that it's a deal-breaker. So the decision to leave might not be the problem. But the way they left\u2014ghosting, changing locks without warning, packing up her stuff and leaving it\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend was financially dependent on him. She's in medical school, so if she's kicked out, she might lose her education. The author's parents and hers are worried about that. Even if she cheated, cutting her off abruptly without considering her financial stability might be seen as harsh. \n\nAlso, the author admits to being angry rather than sad. Anger can lead to impulsive actions. Ghosting without communication is generally considered rude and can be hurtful. Even if the relationship is over, ending it with no warning and cutting off all contact might be seen as inconsiderate, especially when the other person's well-being (financial, educational) is at stake. \n\nThe parents' arguments are valid. The author is making a decision that could have significant consequences for her future. While cheating is unforgivable in many contexts, the method of breaking things off might be where the author is in the wrong. They could have communicated the breakup more responsibly, perhaps allowing her time to adjust financially or emotionally. \n\nSo, even though the infidelity is a valid reason to end the relationship, the abrupt and cold approach, especially given her dependency, might make the author the asshole here. The answer is A.\n"
