I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend cheated on him. That's a major issue in any relationship. Cheating is generally considered a betrayal, and it's a dealbreaker for many people. The author was in a long-term relationship\u20147 years, which is a significant amount of time. They even discussed marriage and kids. So, the trust here was pretty foundational. The fact that she cheated with an ex might add another layer of emotional pain, maybe because of past connections or history.\n\nNow, the author is angry. He's been supporting her financially through her medical education, which is a big commitment. The betrayal after all that investment would be hurtful. His response was to change the locks, leave her things outside, and ghost her without a detailed explanation. He acknowledges that it's not the \"asshole\" move to leave her, but he's concerned about the method he used. \n\nThe parents are involved now, arguing that this is too harsh, especially considering her financial dependence. They're worried she might have to drop out of her medical program. The question here is whether his actions were too extreme given the circumstances.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. The author has every right to feel wronged and to walk away. However, the way he handled it might be problematic. Ghosting without a conversation could be seen as harsh, especially when she's financially dependent on him. By cutting her off access to their shared home and not providing support, he might be leaving her in a vulnerable situation. \n\nFinancial dependence complicates things. Even if she's at fault for cheating, the author's responsibility to support her during this transition is a point to consider. Ending the relationship abruptly without a plan for her financial stability could be seen as irresponsible, even if he's justified in breaking up. \n\nAlso, the parents' concerns about her dropping out are valid. Medical school is a long commitment, and being cut off suddenly could have severe consequences. The author might be acting out of anger, which is understandable, but maybe he should have taken a more measured approach\u2014like having a conversation, maybe giving her a chance to explain, and finding a way to separate their financial ties without leaving her stranded.\n\nIn some perspectives, while cheating is a huge betrayal, the way you end a relationship matters too. Ghosting and cutting someone off entirely without any support, especially when they're dependent on you, can be seen as inconsiderate. It's not just about being right or wrong in the breakup, but how the breakup is handled. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. He's right to end the relationship due to cheating, but the abrupt and financially devastating way he did it might be where he goes wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the method used, even if the reason for breaking up is justified.\n"
