I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated. First, infidelity is a serious issue that can break trust. The author found out through her phone, which might be a privacy concern, but maybe that's a separate issue.\n\nHe's angry and decides to leave without warning. He changes the locks and removes her stuff. That's abrupt. She's financially dependent on him, so this action could leave her in a tough spot. The parents are upset because she might have to drop out of her medical degree. \n\nThe main points: cheating is a reason to break up, but the way he did it was sudden and left her in a vulnerable position. He didn't communicate properly, just ghosted. Even though cheating is a dealbreaker for many, the execution here might be problematic. He's supporting his anger over her actions, but cutting her off completely without any communication could be seen as harsh, especially given her financial dependency. \n\nSo, while the cheating justifies the breakup, the method he used could be seen as inconsiderate. He didn't consider her well-being beyond his own anger. The parents are worried about her future, which adds another layer. The author might not be an asshole for breaking up, but the way he did it might make him the asshole in terms of handling it poorly.\n"
