I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-term relationship where the author discovered their girlfriend cheated and then left her without warning, taking away her belongings and changing the locks. The girlfriend is financially dependent on him and the author is now getting pressure from both families.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for 7 years, planning marriage and kids. She quit her job to pursue a medical degree, which the author supported financially. The cheating incident happened, and instead of a direct confrontation, the author acted immediately by changing locks and moving her stuff out. The author is angry and feels betrayed. The families are pressuring him to reconsider because she might have to drop out of her education.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were abrupt and did not involve a discussion with the girlfriend. Cheating is typically a major breach of trust, and ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, the method of doing so\u2014ghosting and removing her belongings without a conversation\u2014could be problematic, especially since she's financially dependent. This could leave her in a difficult position, potentially affecting her education and living situation.\n\nThe author claims they are not in the wrong, focusing on the cheating as the valid reason. However, the way they ended the relationship might be seen as harsh and lacking empathy, especially considering the financial dependency. It's possible that a more responsible approach would involve a conversation, providing support during the transition, or allowing her time to adjust financially.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend cheated, which is a significant betrayal. The author's anger is understandable. The question is whether the abruptness of the breakup is justified. The author's actions might be seen as cutting off support without consideration for her circumstances, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, there are two sides here: the validity of the reason for breaking up (cheating) versus the method used (abrupt, no communication). The author is not wrong for ending the relationship due to cheating, but the method could be questioned. The pressure from both families suggests that the author's actions have broader consequences, and perhaps a more thoughtful approach would have been better to avoid putting her in a difficult position.\n\nIn many cases, even if someone deserves a breakup, the way it's handled matters. Ghosting and removing someone's belongings without a conversation might be considered insensitive, especially when they are financially dependent. The author might be in the right to end the relationship but in the wrong for not handling it with more care, considering the financial implications for the other person.\n"
