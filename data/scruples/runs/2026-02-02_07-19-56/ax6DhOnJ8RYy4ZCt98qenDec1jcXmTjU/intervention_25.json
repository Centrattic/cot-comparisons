I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-term relationship where the partner cheated. The author discovered the infidelity and, instead of confronting the issue directly, left abruptly, changed the locks, and packed up the girlfriend's stuff without warning. The girlfriend is financially dependent on him, and now their families are upset, arguing that her dropping out of school is a consequence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Cheating is a major betrayal, so the author's anger and decision to end the relationship are understandable. However, the method of ending it\u2014ghosting, changing locks without prior communication\u2014could be problematic. Even if the relationship is over, there are practical considerations, especially when someone is financially dependent. The sudden withdrawal could leave the girlfriend in a vulnerable position, possibly affecting her education and financial stability.\n\nThe question is about whether the author acted wrongly. While cheating is a valid reason to break up, the way it was handled. The author might argue that the emotional distress made them act impulsively. However, the impact on the girlfriend's life (having to drop out of school due to sudden loss of support) is significant. Ethically, even in cases of betrayal, there's an argument for handling the situation with some level of consideration for the other person's circumstances, especially when they are financially dependent. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified in their anger and not want to engage further. But in terms of responsibility, cutting off suddenly without any communication or consideration for her situation could be seen as inconsiderate. The key points are: the suddenness, lack of communication beyond the text, and the practical consequences for her. \n\nIn many relationships, especially long-term ones, there's an expectation of support, and ending it abruptly without addressing the financial aspect could be seen as neglecting that responsibility. Even if the relationship is over, the author's actions might have caused unnecessary hardship. Therefore, while the cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship, the method might be where the author is in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
