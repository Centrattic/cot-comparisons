I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who left their girlfriend without warning after discovering she cheated is in the wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a 7-year relationship, planning marriage and kids. The girlfriend quit her job to pursue a medical degree, becoming financially dependent on him. He found out she cheated with an ex. Instead of confronting her, he got a locksmith to change the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her. Now, both families are contacting him, arguing he should take her back because she might drop out of school.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether his actions were wrong. Cheating is generally considered a betrayal, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the way he handled it is questionable. Ghosting without communication can be hurtful and abrupt. But there's also the fact that she was financially dependent on him, which complicates things. If she drops out of school, he might feel responsible since he supported her education. However, her cheating was a breach of trust, which could justify his decision to leave. \n\nHe might be in the right for ending the relationship due to infidelity, but the method of leaving without warning could be problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the reason for leaving versus the method. Cheating is a justified reason, but ghosting and cutting off contact entirely might be seen as harsh, especially without allowing her to explain or address the situation. However, considering her financial dependence, he might have valid concerns about her dropping out. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while cheating is a deal-breaker for many, the abrupt departure without communication could be seen as insensitive. However, the person's anger and the betrayal might justify his immediate actions. The key points are the validity of the reason (cheating) and the method of separation. Since the user himself believes he's not an asshole, but is unsure about the approach, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance in the method.\n"
