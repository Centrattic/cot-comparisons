I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated on him. The situation is that they've been together for 7 years, and he's been financially supporting her as she pursued a medical degree. When he found out about the infidelity, he got angry and decided to cut her off completely by changing the locks, packing her stuff, and not wanting to see her again. His parents and hers are upset, saying it's too harsh and she might have to drop out of school.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal, so his anger is understandable. But how he handled it might be the issue here. Ghosting without any communication can be seen as cruel, especially since she's financially dependent on him. He's cutting her off completely, which could have serious consequences for her education and livelihood. Even if he's hurt, abruptly ending the relationship like this might not be considerate of her situation.\n\nFinancial dependence adds another layer. If she's relying on him for rent, food, tuition, suddenly cutting her off is not just emotional but practical. It's possible that he's aware of this, but still chose to act out of anger. Even if he's justified in ending the relationship, the method might be too harsh. He could have at least considered a more compassionate approach, like giving her time to adjust or helping her transition.\n\nAlso, the fact that both families are involved suggests that there's a social expectation to handle this differently. While he may not be an asshole for ending things, the way he did it could be seen as inconsiderate. The key point here is whether the actions taken were proportionate to the betrayal. Cheating is a valid reason to break up, but the execution can affect how others perceive the situation.\n\nSo, while his decision to end the relationship isn't wrong, the way he did it\u2014ghosting, cutting her off abruptly, and not considering her financial state\u2014might make him the asshole in terms of how he handled the aftermath. The answer would likely be A, but I need to check if there's a cultural or situational nuance I'm missing. Maybe in some contexts, cutting ties after cheating is expected, but given the financial dependence, it's a gray area. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just if he's justified. The abruptness and lack of communication are key factors here.\n"
