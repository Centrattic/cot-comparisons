I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who left their girlfriend after discovering she cheated is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 7 years, talked about marriage and kids. The GF quit her job to pursue a medical degree, which the guy supported financially, including rent, food, tuition. Then he found out she cheated with an ex. He got angry, changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her. Now, both families are upset, saying it's too hasty and she might have to drop out of school.\n\nSo, the key points here are the betrayal (cheating) and the way he ended the relationship. Cheating is a major issue in relationships, and it's understandable that he would be hurt and angry. However, the method he used to end things\u2014ghosting without explanation, changing locks, packing her stuff\u2014seems abrupt and could be seen as harsh. \n\nFinancial dependency complicates things. She's relying on him for her education and living expenses. By cutting her off suddenly, he's leaving her in a vulnerable position, which might affect her ability to complete her degree. The families argue that this is too severe after seven years, and maybe there's a point about considering practical consequences.\n\nBut on the other hand, cheating is a fundamental breach of trust. If he truly can't reconcile and move past it, ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong. The question is about the approach. Ghosting without communication is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, given the betrayal, his anger and desire to cut ties might be justified emotionally. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, while cheating is inexcusable, the way he ended the relationship could be problematic. Sudden removal from the home and financial support without discussion might be seen as cutting her off without considering the consequences. There's a balance between taking a stand and being considerate of the other person's circumstances. Maybe a more responsible approach would involve having a difficult conversation about the cheating, discussing future steps, and planning a transition that allows her to continue her education without immediate eviction. \n\nBut he might feel too hurt to communicate. The dilemma is between his right to leave due to cheating and her potential hardship. The answer depends on whether the method of ending the relationship was fair. Since he admitted he's not an asshole for leaving, but the method is in question, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong for the way he handled it, not necessarily for leaving.\n"
