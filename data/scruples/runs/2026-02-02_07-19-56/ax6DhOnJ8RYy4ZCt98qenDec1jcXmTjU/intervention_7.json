I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person left their girlfriend after finding out she cheated. She was financially dependent on him. He took her stuff out, changed the locks, and ghosted her. His parents and hers are upset, saying he shouldn't have thrown away seven years and that she might have to drop out of school.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that it's a deal-breaker. So the decision to end the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. But the way he did it seems harsh. Ghosting without any communication is a common point of contention. Even if you're angry, cutting off contact completely without any warning can be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she's dependent on him financially.\n\nHe changed the locks while she was at class. That means she came home to an empty house, which is pretty abrupt. Taking her things out and telling her brother to come get the rest\u2014she might not have time to retrieve her stuff, which could be problematic if she needs it for school or other necessities. Also, she's in a medical program; dropping out isn't a small thing. He might have added unnecessary stress on her, which could impact her education.\n\nHe mentions she cheated with an ex who's \"going nowhere in life,\" but that's not his decision to judge. His anger is understandable, but acting out of anger might lead to rash decisions. The key issue is the method. Ending a relationship because of cheating is valid, but the abruptness and lack of consideration for her situation (financial dependency, education) could make his actions seem harsh.\n\nPeople often say that even in breakups, some level of communication or consideration is necessary. Ghosting and cutting her off immediately without any discussion or transition might be seen as inconsiderate. His parents' concerns about her dropping out might be valid, especially if she can't afford the sudden financial shift. He might be contributing to a larger problem by not providing a way for her to adjust.\n\nSo while the cheating is her fault, the way he handled the breakup could make him responsible for exacerbating her situation. Therefore, he might be in the wrong not for ending the relationship but for how he did it. The answer is A because the method was inconsiderate and abrupt, potentially causing additional harm beyond the cheating itself.\n"
