I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend who cheated on him without warning, especially since she's financially dependent on him. The situation involves a 7-year relationship, plans for marriage and kids, and he found out about her cheating. He got angry, changed the locks, packed her stuff, and left it outside, telling her he doesn't want to see her again. Now his parents and her parents are upset, saying she might have to drop out of her medical degree.\n\nHmm, first, the cheating part. Infidelity is a big deal in relationships. Most people would consider it a deal-breaker. So the author's anger is understandable. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and cutting her off without any communication. Since she's financially dependent on him, this might have serious consequences for her. Even if he's angry, he might have a responsibility to her, especially if they had talked about marriage and future plans. \n\nHe changed the locks while she was at class, which could leave her without a place to live suddenly. Piling her stuff outside might make it harder for her to retrieve things, especially if she's in an emotional state. The parents are concerned about her dropping out of school because she can't afford it anymore. That's a valid concern. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong. If he was going to break up with her, he should have communicated it properly, even if he's angry. Ghosting and cutting off support abruptly could be seen as inconsiderate, especially given her financial situation. Maybe he should have given her time to adjust or find help. But on the other hand, the betrayal might have justified his actions. However, the method is questionable. \n\nSo, answer A or B? AITA (Am I the Asshole) is a subreddit where people ask if they're the asshole. The author isn't denying that he's upset, but he's asking if cutting her off completely and abruptly is wrong. The parents' arguments are about the consequences for her. Even if he's justified in ending the relationship, the way he did it could be seen as wrong. So the answer is A, he's in the wrong for the harsh method.\n"
