I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who left his financially dependent girlfriend after finding out she cheated. He changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her. The parents are upset because she might have to drop out of her medical degree.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major issue in relationships. The guy found out his girlfriend cheated, which is a betrayal. It's understandable that he's angry. The question is about whether he handled it wrong by cutting off contact abruptly without warning. \n\nThe user mentions that he's not an asshole for leaving her, but the main issue is the way he did it. Ghosting and cutting her off without support could be problematic, especially since she's financially dependent. She's in a medical program, so if she has to drop out, that's a huge loss. \n\nHe arranged for her to get her stuff through her brother, but he's not willing to communicate. The parents are worried about her future. Legally and ethically, when someone is financially dependent on you, cutting off support suddenly can lead to serious consequences, like her having to leave her studies. \n\nBut on the other hand, being cheated on is a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the way he ended it\u2014without communication and cutting her off completely\u2014might be seen as harsh. Even if he's angry, handling it in a way that leaves her in a vulnerable position could be considered irresponsible. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe the answer is A (Yes). Because while cheating is unforgivable, how he ended the relationship might have been unnecessarily cruel, especially considering her financial dependence and future. He could have handled it more responsibly, like giving her time to adjust or helping her transition, even after the betrayal. Ghosting and cutting off all contact without a plan might be seen as inconsiderate towards her well-being.\n"
