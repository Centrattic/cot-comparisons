I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after leaving his girlfriend who cheated on him without warning. The author mentions they've been together for 7+ years, she's financially dependent on him, and he found out about the cheating through her phone. He changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her. His parents and hers are upset, saying she might have to drop out of school.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. It's understandable that he's angry. But the way he handled it is the issue here. He didn't confront her first, didn't give her a chance to explain, and cut her off completely without warning. She's financially dependent, so being kicked out suddenly could leave her in a bad position, even if she did wrong. The author's actions seem impulsive and possibly cruel, especially considering her circumstances. He's being asked if he's being an asshole, and while the cheating is her fault, his method of ending the relationship might be seen as unfair. He should have at least had a conversation to address the cheating before cutting her off, especially given their long-term commitment and her financial situation. So, the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
