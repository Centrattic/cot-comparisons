I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend without warning after discovering she cheated, especially since she's financially dependent on him.\n\nFirst, cheating is generally considered a serious breach of trust. So, the girlfriend definitely did something wrong here. The author found out through her phone, which might be a bit of an invasion of privacy, but the main issue is the infidelity. \n\nNow, the author's reaction: he changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her. He didn't give her a chance to explain or talk things out. That's a big problem. Even though he was angry, cutting off communication entirely and removing her from their home without warning could leave her in a vulnerable position, especially since she's financially dependent on him. She might be forced to drop out of school if she can't afford to continue without his support. \n\nThe parents on both sides are upset because they see the 7-year relationship as significant and are concerned about the consequences for her education. The author's approach seems impulsive and not considerate of her immediate needs. While he has every right to end the relationship because of cheating, the way he did it\u2014without communication and leaving her stranded\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nFinancial dependency adds another layer. He was supporting her through college, so abruptly cutting off that support might have severe repercussions for her. Even if he's angry, providing some time for her to adjust or offering assistance could have been more responsible. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while cheating is a deal-breaker, the method of ending the relationship matters. Ghosting and removing her belongings without notice could be seen as harsh and lacking empathy. The author's anger is understandable, but his actions didn't account for her situation, leading to potential harm beyond the relationship itself. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend cheated, the author's approach might be inconsiderate and irresponsible given her dependency. Therefore, he could be in the wrong in how he handled the situation, even if the decision to leave isn't.\n"
