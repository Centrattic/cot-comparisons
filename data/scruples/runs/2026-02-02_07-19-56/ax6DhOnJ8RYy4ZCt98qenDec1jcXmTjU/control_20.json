I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting their girlfriend after she cheated. The situation is pretty intense. The couple has been together seven years, talked about marriage and kids. The girlfriend quit her job to go to medical school, which the author supported financially. Then he finds out she cheated with an ex. Instead of confronting her, he changes the locks, packs her stuff, and leaves without warning. Now both families are upset, and the author is questioning if he was too harsh.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal, so the author's anger is understandable. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting, changing locks, not giving her a chance to explain\u2014could be problematic. She's dependent on him financially, so kicking her out might leave her in a tough spot, even if he's justified in feeling hurt. The author says he's not in the wrong, but the method of breaking up is what's in question.\n\nThe families are worried about her dropping out of school. The author's approach might be seen as cutting off support without considering the consequences, which could be seen as harsh. Even if she cheated, the abruptness and lack of communication might make him seem inconsiderate, especially given her financial dependence. But on the other hand, she betrayed him, so he has the right to end the relationship. The question is whether the method was wrong. So the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because while the betrayal is valid, the way he ended it was abrupt and didn't account for her situation. But it's a bit nuanced. Some might say he's justified in breaking up but should have handled it more thoughtfully. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might be A because of the lack of communication and the financial aspect.\n"
