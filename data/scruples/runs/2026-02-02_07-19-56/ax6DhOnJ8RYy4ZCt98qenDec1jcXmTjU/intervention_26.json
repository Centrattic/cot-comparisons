I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author left their girlfriend after discovering she cheated. They had been together for 7 years, talked about marriage and kids, and the girlfriend left her job to go to medical school, which the author supported financially. The author found out about the cheating, got angry, changed the locks, packed her stuff, and ghosted her without a proper conversation. Now both sets of parents are upset, saying the author is being too harsh.\n\nFirst, cheating is a big deal. Most people would agree that cheating is a breach of trust and can be a valid reason to end a relationship. So the author's decision to leave isn't inherently wrong. The question here is about the method of leaving\u2014ghosting and abruptly cutting off contact and her living situation without warning her first.\n\nThe girlfriend is financially dependent, which adds complexity. She's in a medical program, so if she's forced to drop out, that's a huge loss. The author might not have considered her immediate needs or given her a chance to explain, even though cheating is a serious issue. However, the author was angry and acted impulsively. Maybe they should have had a conversation first to address the situation, even if they were going to break up. Ghosting and removing her from the home without notice could be seen as harsh and thoughtless, especially given her financial dependency and the potential consequences for her education. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels wronged and justified in ending the relationship. They might believe that after the betrayal, they don't owe her support. But the way they handled it might have caused unnecessary harm. The parents' concern is valid because her dropping out of school would be a significant setback. The author's actions might be seen as not considering the practical implications for her, even if the emotional betrayal was the catalyst.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. While cheating is a valid reason to end the relationship, the method of doing so\u2014without communication or consideration for her circumstances\u2014might make them at least partially at fault. The key here is the lack of communication and the abruptness, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the decision to end the relationship was justified. The author should have handled the breakup more thoughtfully, perhaps allowing her to retrieve her belongings at her own pace or discussing the situation first. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the way they handled the situation, even if the reason for ending the relationship is understandable.\n"
