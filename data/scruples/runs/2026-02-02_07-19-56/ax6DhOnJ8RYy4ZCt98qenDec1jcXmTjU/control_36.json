I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who left their girlfriend without warning after finding out she cheated is in the wrong. The situation is complex because the girlfriend is financially dependent on him, and he cut her off abruptly.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that it's a valid reason to end a relationship. So from that standpoint, he's not wrong for leaving. But the way he did it is questionable. Ghosting, changing the locks without notice, and not allowing her to retrieve her belongings could be seen as harsh, especially since she's financially dependent on him. \n\nHe mentions that he's angry, which makes sense, but his actions might have been impulsive. By cutting her off completely, he's leaving her in a vulnerable position. She might not have the means to sustain herself now, and his parents are concerned she might have to drop out of her medical program. That's a serious consequence. \n\nEven though cheating justifies the breakup, the method of ending the relationship is important. Handling it without communication or providing support could make him look like the asshole because he's not considering her well-being. Maybe he should have given her a chance to explain, or at least allowed a more gradual transition to help her adjust financially. \n\nSo, while his anger is understandable, the abrupt and harsh manner of the breakup, especially considering her dependency, likely makes him at least partially wrong in the eyes of others. The answer is A.\n"
