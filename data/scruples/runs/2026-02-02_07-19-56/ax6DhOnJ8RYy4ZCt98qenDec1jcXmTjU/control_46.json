I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who left their girlfriend after she cheated is in the wrong, considering how they did it. The situation involves a 7-year relationship where the girlfriend was financially dependent, and the guy found out she cheated. He got angry and decided to cut her off completely, changing locks, packing her stuff, and cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, the cheating is a major betrayal. Normally, that's a valid reason to end a relationship. But the way he handled it is questionable. Ghosting without warning, especially in a situation where she's financially dependent, could be seen as harsh. He didn't give her a chance to explain or face her actions directly. Also, removing her belongings and changing locks without her knowledge might be legally iffy. He's prioritizing his anger over her well-being, which could leave her in a vulnerable position, possibly leading to her dropping out of medical school as her family fears.\n\nHis parents and hers are worried about the consequences. While he's justified in being upset, cutting her off abruptly without considering her financial and educational stability might be where he's in the wrong. Even though cheating is a dealbreaker, the method of ending things could be seen as inconsiderate and potentially harmful. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because of how he handled the situation, despite the valid reason for breaking up.\n"
