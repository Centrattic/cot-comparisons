I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their girlfriend of seven years cheated on them. The girlfriend was financially dependent, and the author left her without warning by changing the locks, taking her stuff out, and cutting off contact. The author is angry because they felt they put a lot into the relationship and were supposed to get married and have kids. Now their families are pressuring them to take her back, but the author isn't sure if their reaction was appropriate.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal, so the author's anger is understandable. However, the way they handled it might be the issue. Ghosting without warning, especially when someone is financially dependent, can leave them in a really vulnerable situation. The author changed the locks without giving her a chance to retrieve her belongings, which seems harsh. They also didn't engage in a conversation, which might have been necessary for closure or to discuss the financial implications. \n\nFinancial dependence complicates things because suddenly cutting off support could force her into a difficult position, like dropping out of school as the parents mentioned. Even though cheating is a valid reason to break up, the method here might be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be acting out of anger, which can cloud judgment. They didn't consider the practical consequences for her, which could be seen as selfish or thoughtless. \n\nOn the other hand, the cheating was a deal-breaker for the author. They have a right to end the relationship, but the manner in which they did it could be problematic. The key here is whether the author's actions were necessary or if a more measured approach would have been better. The families' input might be biased, but their concern about her financial situation is valid. The author might need to take responsibility for the way they handled the breakup, even if the decision to leave was justified. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while understandable given the betrayal, were perhaps too abrupt and inconsiderate of the other person's circumstances. That leans towards the author being in the wrong in terms of how they executed the breakup, even if the decision itself wasn't entirely their fault.\n"
