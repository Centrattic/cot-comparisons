I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ended their 7-year relationship after finding out their girlfriend cheated. The girlfriend was financially dependent on them, and the author left without warning, changed the locks, and packed her stuff. Now they're getting pressure from both families to reconcile.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author discovered cheating, which is a major betrayal. However, the way they handled the breakup is in question. They didn't give a warning, didn't communicate directly, and took actions that left the girlfriend in a difficult financial situation. The girlfriend was in medical school and had quit her job, so being cut off financially could affect her education and livelihood.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable, but the response might be seen as harsh. Ghosting and sudden removal of support without considering her circumstances could be viewed as inconsiderate. Even though the cheating is the girlfriend's fault, the author's method of ending the relationship could be problematic. They didn't allow her time to adjust financially or emotionally. The families are concerned about her dropping out, which adds another layer of consequence.\n\nIn relationships, when one partner is financially dependent, the breakup can have serious repercussions. The author might be justified in ending the relationship due to the infidelity, but the abruptness and lack of support afterward could make them seem harsh. The question is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the context. While the cheating is the girlfriend's wrongdoing, the author's response might be seen as exacerbating the situation without due consideration. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the way they handled the aftermath, even if the reason for breaking up is justified.\n"
