I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated on him. The girlfriend had quit her job to pursue a medical degree, and he's been supporting her financially. The key points here are the cheating and the sudden, no-warning exit.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that it's a deal-breaker, so the author isn't wrong for ending the relationship. But the way he did it is important. He changed the locks while she was at class, packed her stuff outside, and didn't communicate directly. The parents are involved, arguing that she'll have to drop out if he kicks her out.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable given the infidelity and the financial support he's given. However, the sudden action without prior discussion might be problematic. Ghosting after such a long relationship could be seen as abrupt, especially if she's dependent on him financially and academically. The parents' concerns are about her dropping out and the impact of his actions on her education, which he might need to consider if he's morally responsible for her well-being.\n\nBut the user says he's not an asshole for leaving her, just wants to know if the method was wrong. The wrongness here might depend on cultural or personal views. Some might say that even after cheating, you should handle the breakup with compassion, especially when someone's future is at stake. Others might argue that the betrayal justifies an immediate exit to avoid further hurt. The fact that he sent a text but didn't want to speak to her again is a middle ground, but taking physical actions like changing locks and removing her belongings could be seen as harsh without prior notice. It's a balance between self-respect and the impact on her life. So maybe the answer is A, but I need to check if ending the relationship is justified and if the method is acceptable. Since the user is firm about not being an asshole for leaving, the focus is on the method. The answer might be A because the way he handled it is abrupt and could have been more considerate, even if the reason is valid.\n"
