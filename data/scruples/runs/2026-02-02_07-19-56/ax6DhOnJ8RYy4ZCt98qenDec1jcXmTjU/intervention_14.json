I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-term relationship where the author found out their girlfriend cheated. The author left her without warning, changed the locks, and packed her stuff out, leading to her being financially dependent on them. Both families are upset, and the author is now questioning if they handled it right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issue: cheating. Cheating is a major betrayal, and it's generally seen as a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the way the author handled it might be problematic. Ghosting without communication, especially when the partner is financially dependent, could lead to serious consequences for her, like not being able to continue her education. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014changing locks and packing her belongings without notice\u2014could be seen as harsh. Even though the cheating is a reason to break up, the abruptness and lack of support might be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's financial dependency adds another layer; leaving her in such a position might be irresponsible, even if the author is angry. \n\nThe author's parents and the girlfriend's parents are concerned about her dropping out. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the practical implications of their actions. While cheating is a deal-breaker for many, the method of ending the relationship could be seen as uncaring, especially when it affects the other person's well-being and future.\n\nHowever, the author's anger is understandable. The situation is complex. On one hand, the betrayal is significant. On the other, the way the author handled it could have been more considerate. The key point is whether cutting off all contact and making it difficult for the financially dependent partner was justified. \n\nIn terms of societal views, while cheating is unforgivable to some, the response's extremity might tip the scales. The author might be seen as not taking responsibility for the consequences of their actions, even if the initial reason is valid. So, considering all factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the abrupt and potentially harmful way they ended the relationship despite knowing the financial dependency.\n"
