I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting their girlfriend after she cheated. They had a long-term relationship, planned for marriage and kids, and she was financially dependent on him. He found out about the cheating, got angry, changed the locks, packed her stuff, and cut her off without a warning.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. Most people would agree that it's a valid reason to end the relationship. So the decision to leave isn't the issue here. The question is about the method\u2014ghosting and cutting her off abruptly. She's financially dependent, so this action could have serious consequences for her, like being unable to continue her education. \n\nHe's angry, which is understandable, but how he handled it might be problematic. By changing the locks and removing her stuff without explanation, he's making it hard for her to retrieve her belongings. The parents are concerned because she might have to drop out of school. The key here is whether his actions were too harsh given the circumstances. \n\nOn one hand, he's justified in ending the relationship due to infidelity. On the other hand, his approach could be seen as lacking compassion, especially considering her financial dependency. Even though she cheated, cutting her off completely without any communication might be seen as inconsiderate. The parents' arguments about her education and the abruptness of his actions might hold some weight. \n\nSo, the main issue is the method rather than the decision to leave. The author's anger led to a harsh response, which might not be fair to her situation. Therefore, while he's not in the wrong for ending the relationship, the way he handled it could be seen as inconsiderate, making him the asshole in terms of the approach.\n"
