I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend after discovering she cheated. The situation is complicated because she was financially dependent on him, and he ghosted her without warning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The key issue here is cheating, which is a major betrayal in most relationships. The author was angry and decided to leave, but the way he did it\u2014changing the locks, packing her stuff, and not communicating directly\u2014might be problematic. \n\nHe mentions that she's financially dependent, which adds a layer of responsibility. By cutting off all contact abruptly, he might be putting her in a difficult position, especially since she's in medical school. However, the betrayal by her cheating could justify his need to leave, even if the method was harsh.\n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. Instead of a direct conversation, he used a text message and involved her brother. That lack of face-to-face communication might be seen as insensitive, even if he was hurt and angry. The parents are upset because they fear the consequences for her education and financial situation.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a valid reason to end a relationship. On the other hand, the manner in which he ended it\u2014without warning, cutting her off completely, and not allowing her to explain\u2014could be seen as harsh. The financial dependency might make it harder for her to cope, but that's also a result of the relationship dynamics they were in.\n\nI think the author isn't the asshole because cheating is a major transgression. However, the way he handled the breakup could be improved. Ghosting and not allowing her to explain might be seen as cruel, but it doesn't negate the betrayal. The answer would be B (No), but with the caveat that the method of ending the relationship could be more considerate."
