I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the main points: The person (let's call him John) left his girlfriend after she cheated. They've been together 7 years, talked about marriage and kids. She quit her job to pursue a medical degree and became financially dependent on him. He found out she cheated via her phone, got angry, changed the locks, took her stuff out, and ghosted her. Now, both their families are pressuring him to reconsider because she can't afford school anymore and might have to drop out. He's questioning if he was wrong for leaving like that.\n\nSo, the key issues here are: cheating, the method of leaving, financial dependency, and family pressure.\n\nCheating is a dealbreaker for many people. If John felt violated and decided to end the relationship, that's understandable. But the way he did it\u2014without warning, changing the locks while she was away, removing her things, and ghosting\u2014could be problematic. Cheating is a serious betrayal, but the reaction might have been abrupt and harsh. Especially since she's financially dependent on him. By cutting her off abruptly, he's leaving her in a vulnerable position. Even though she cheated, she might not have immediate means to support herself or continue her education. \n\nThe argument from the families is that she could drop out of school, which would be a significant loss. But from John's perspective, he's done supporting someone who betrayed him. The question is whether it's fair to leave someone in such a vulnerable state, even if they wronged him. \n\nHe says he's not in the wrong because he's not an asshole for leaving, but he's concerned about the method. The way he left might be seen as cruel, especially considering her financial situation. Even if she cheated, cutting her off without warning and making her homeless could be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, while the cheating justifies the breakup, the method might not be the right approach. He should have handled it more compassionately, maybe given her time to find elsewhere, or discussed the situation so she could have a plan. But the user's own opinion is that he's in the wrong, but they want validation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a mix. The reason (cheating) is valid, but the execution (abrupt, without support) might be the issue. So the answer would depend on whether the method of leaving is as important as the reason. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong) because of the way he handled it, despite the reason.\n"
