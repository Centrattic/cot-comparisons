I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.\n\n-------------------------\n\nMy gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.\n\nLast week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.\n\nAnyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.\n\nSo I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.\n\nAnyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving and ghosting his girlfriend after she cheated on him. The situation involves a seven-year relationship where the author was financially supporting her through her medical studies. He found out about the cheating, got angry, changed the locks, packed her things, and left her a text without further communication. His parents and hers are now pressuring him to reconsider because she might have to drop out of school, which he's supporting.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major breach of trust. Generally, people have the right to end a relationship if they're betrayed. So the decision to leave isn't inherently wrong. However, the way he handled it is questionable. Ghosting\u2014cutting off all communication without any discussion\u2014can be hurtful and unfair. Especially since she's financially dependent on him, abruptly cutting her off without a plan could leave her in a vulnerable position. \n\nHe changed the locks without her presence and packed her stuff, which is a sudden and harsh action. Even if he's angry, taking such steps without a conversation might be seen as inconsiderate of her situation. The parents are concerned about her education and financial stability because he's been supporting her. By leaving her in this way, he might be putting her in a difficult spot, but he's also justified in ending the relationship due to her infidelity.\n\nThe key points here are the betrayal and the response. While the author isn't wrong for ending the relationship, the method he used\u2014ghosting and abrupt removal from his home\u2014might be seen as harsh. The question is whether the means of ending the relationship make him the asshole. In many cases, people might argue that even after a betrayal, some level of communication and consideration is necessary, especially when there are financial dependencies involved.\n\nSo, he's not in the wrong for breaking up, but the way he did it could be considered inconsiderate. The answer hinges on whether the method of ending the relationship is seen as justified. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong in general, the answer would be that he's not (B), but the approach could be criticized. However, the question is binary, so the main factor is the betrayal. The answer is likely B, but there's nuance.\n"
