He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. \n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and even showed R-rated movies. The friend, who the author has known for a short time, got offended by a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend took this to the principal, leading to the teacher's suspension.\n\nThe author is upset because they liked the teacher and found the friend's reaction over the top. The friend is now disliked by others. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friendship.\n\nSo, considering the teacher's behavior, even if it's meant as a joke, making a comment like that about suicide is pretty serious. Suicide is a sensitive topic, and even if the teacher intended it as a joke, such a remark can be harmful, especially in a position of authority. The friend might have a valid reason to feel hurt or threatened, especially if they have mental health issues or a history of being sensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher's approach was to use humor, which might be inappropriate in some contexts. The friend's reaction led to the suspension, which affected both the teacher and the friend's social standing. The author is upset because they lost a friend but also lost access to a class they enjoyed.\n\nThe key points here are the teacher's responsibility to maintain a safe environment and the friend's right to feel safe. Even if the teacher meant it as a joke, the comment could be seen as crossing a line. The friend acting to address what she perceived as a harmful comment might be justified, especially if she felt threatened. However, the author's decision to end the friendship because of this raises the question of whether they prioritized the teacher's humor over their friend's well-being.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action of cutting off the friend might be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings and mental health. The author might not have considered the friend's perspective, especially if the friend has a history of being triggered by such comments. However, the teacher's behavior also needs to be assessed. If the teacher's jokes were a pattern and not addressed by the school, that's a different issue. But in this case, the friend's action led to consequences for the teacher. \n\nGiven that the author is focusing on the loss of the teacher and the friend's social repercussions, but not addressing the friend's possible valid reasons for feeling hurt, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding the friend's perspective. Ending a friendship over this could be seen as not supporting a friend when they needed it, especially if the friend was standing up for herself in a situation that could have been harmful. Therefore, the author might be at fault for prioritizing the teacher's behavior over their friend's emotional response.\n"
