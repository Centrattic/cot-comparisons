He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style story is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The teacher, T, was known for making dark, inappropriate jokes and showing R-rated movies. He's popular among students. The friend, who the author met recently, is described as someone who gets easily offended. The teacher made a joke about suicide to the friend, which was taken seriously. The friend reported it, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and ended the friendship. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the teacher's behavior, the friend's action, and the author's response. \n\nThe teacher made a joke that could be hurtful. Even if it was meant as a joke, if it's about suicide, that's a serious topic. The friend took it seriously and reported it, leading to suspension. The question is whether the friend overreacted. If the teacher's joke was inappropriate, then the friend's action might be justified. However, if the teacher has a history of such humor and the students are used to it, maybe the friend's reaction is out of context. \n\nBut even if the joke was part of the teacher's usual style, making a suicide comment is crossing a line. Teachers have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, and such jokes could be harmful, especially if the student is vulnerable. The friend might have felt targeted or unsafe. \n\nThe author is ending the friendship because they think the friend overreacted. But they don't know the friend's mental health history. The friend could have been triggered by the comment. The author is quick to cut ties without understanding the friend's perspective. \n\nSo, the author's action of ending the friendship might be too harsh. They should consider that the friend had a different experience with the teacher. The teacher's suspension could be a result of a legitimate concern, even if it's a joke. The author is prioritizing their own relationship with the teacher over the friend, without fully understanding the situation. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's possible valid reasons and for cutting off the friendship without seeking to understand. So the answer would be A.\n"
