He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is at fault for ending a friendship because their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. He was popular among students. The friend, who's the one causing the issue, got offended by a joke where T said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" and then reported him, leading to a suspension. The author ends the friendship over that.\n\nSo the main points are: The teacher was making jokes, the friend took it seriously, reported the teacher, got him suspended. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and the friend is now disliked. They're wondering if they're in the wrong for cutting off the friend.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The teacher's comment was a joke, not meant to be taken seriously. The friend, however, reacted strongly, possibly due to personal sensitivities. The author is upset that the friend caused the teacher to lose his job (suspended for a month). But the friend might have felt that the joke was harmful or hurtful, maybe due to their own mental health issues. The author didn't know the friend's history, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ending a friendship over someone else's actions can be seen as harsh. But the friend's action had real consequences. The author might feel that the friend overreacted, but they might not consider the friend's perspective. On the other hand, the teacher's suspension is a serious matter, and the friend's action led to that. But if the teacher was just joking, maybe the friend escalated it unnecessarily.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had enough information to judge the friend. They mention not knowing the friend's history, so they might not understand why the friend reacted that way. Ending the friendship without understanding could be seen as hasty. However, the friend did take a serious action that affected others. But the teacher's suspension might have been an overreaction by the school as well, depending on the context.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: The teacher made a joke that could be offensive. The friend took offense and reported it. The school decided to suspend the teacher. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and the friend caused this. The author ends the friendship. \n\nIs the author wrong? If the friend's action was justified because the teacher's comment was harmful, then the author is wrong to be upset. But if the teacher was just joking and the friend overreacted, then the author is right. But without knowing the friend's history, the author can't fully assess. Ending the friendship might be cutting off someone without fully understanding their side. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not trying to understand the friend's perspective first. Alternatively, if the friend's action was indeed over the line, then the author isn't wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is at fault. The friend's action led to a teacher being suspended, which is significant. The author is upset because they liked the teacher. However, the friend might have felt it was necessary. Without knowing the friend's mental health, it's hard to judge. The author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as prioritizing their preference for the teacher over the friend's well-being. But if the teacher was in the wrong, then the friend was right to report. However, if the teacher was just joking and the friend misinterpreted it, then the friend is at fault. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for ending the friendship if they felt the friend acted inappropriately. But they might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's possible reasons. The answer hinges on whether the friend's action was justified. Since we don't know the friend's history, but the teacher's comment was a joke, perhaps the friend overreacted. But even then, taking a joke as a serious comment could be a valid reaction for someone sensitive. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong if they believed the friend overreacted, but they could be in the wrong for not understanding the friend's perspective. Since the author admits they don't know the friend's history, their judgment might be hasty. Therefore, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong because they ended the friendship without full understanding.\n"
