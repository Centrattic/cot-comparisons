He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a friend who got a teacher suspended by reporting a joke that was taken the wrong way. The writer ended the friendship because of that.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and showing R-rated movies. He was popular among students. The friend in question is someone who gets easily offended. The teacher made a joke about considering suicide, which the friend took seriously and reported, leading to the suspension. The writer is upset because they liked the teacher and now the friend is disliked by others.\n\nThe main question is whether the writer is in the wrong for ending the friendship. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher's comment was a joke, but saying something like \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" is pretty serious. Even if it's meant as a joke, it's a sensitive topic. If the teacher said that in a class, especially to a student who might be vulnerable, it's possible that the teacher crossed a line. The friend might have felt targeted or harassed, which could be a valid reason to report it. The school's responsibility is to ensure a safe environment for students, so the friend might have done the right thing by reporting the comment.\n\nHowever, the writer is upset because the teacher was a favorite and the friend is now disliked. Ending a friendship over this could be seen as cutting off someone who tried to protect themselves from a potentially harmful situation. The writer might be prioritizing the teacher's behavior over the friend's well-being, which could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's reaction led to the teacher being suspended, which affected everyone who liked the teacher. The writer might feel that the friend overreacted, especially if the teacher had a history of making jokes. But whether the joke was appropriate is another angle. Even if the teacher thought it was a joke, certain topics like suicide are not appropriate to joke about in a classroom setting. The friend might not have known if the teacher was genuinely being cruel or just joking, so reporting it could be a responsible action.\n\nThe writer's decision to end the friendship might be based on not understanding the friend's perspective. The friend might have mental health issues that made the comment more harmful. The writer doesn't know the friend's history, which complicates things. Ending the friendship without fully understanding why the friend acted the way they did could be seen as hasty.\n\nBut then again, the writer has the right to end a friendship if they feel it's necessary, especially if they value the teacher more. However, in this case, the friend was trying to address a potential issue that affected her personally. The writer might not have considered the friend's point of view enough.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer hinges on whether the friend acted appropriately and whether the writer overreacted. If the teacher's comment was indeed inappropriate, then the friend did the right thing, and the writer is in the wrong for cutting off a friend who tried to seek help. However, if the teacher's comment was a harmless joke, then the friend overreacted, and the writer's action is justified. The problem is that it's hard to determine the context of the joke without more information. The key point is that the teacher's behavior might have been unprofessional, and the friend's action could be a valid response. Therefore, the writer is in the wrong for ending the friendship without considering the friend's perspective and the potential seriousness of the teacher's comment.\n"
