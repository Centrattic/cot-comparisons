He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a friend got a teacher suspended by reporting a joke that was taken the wrong way. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and doing R-rated movies, and the friend, who gets easily offended, took offense to a comment like \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The teacher wasn't being serious, but the friend and her mom escalated it, leading to the suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and now ended the friendship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend might have felt genuinely hurt or unsafe by the teacher's comment, even if it was meant as a joke. People's reactions can vary, especially if they have a history of mental health issues. But the author is mad because the teacher was suspended, and they ended the friendship over it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for ending the friendship? Well, friendships are about mutual respect. If the friend's actions led to a teacher losing their job, maybe the author felt betrayed. However, the friend might have felt that the teacher's comment was harmful. But the way it was handled\u2014reporting it immediately\u2014could be seen as overreacting if it was a joke. But again, intentions don't always matter in how people perceive things.\n\nThe author didn't know the friend's mental state or background. The friend could have valid reasons for being sensitive. But the author chose to end the friendship, which might be cutting off without understanding. On the other hand, the friend's actions caused a month-long suspension, which is a big consequence. The author might feel that the friend was too quick to escalate things without considering the context or the teacher's intentions.\n\nBut is ending the friendship justified? It's a personal choice, but maybe the author could have tried to talk to the friend first instead of cutting ties. However, if the author felt that the friend betrayed the teacher, who they liked, it's a valid emotional response. The question is whether the author's reaction (ending the friendship) is justified. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their feelings towards the teacher, but they might also be missing the friend's perspective. The key is whether the author considered the friend's possible reasons before cutting off. Since the author didn't know the friend's history, maybe they should have had a conversation. But in the end, the author is allowed to feel upset about the teacher's suspension. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to end a friendship if they feel betrayed or upset by the friend's actions, even if the friend had their own reasons. However, some might argue that the author's reaction was too harsh. But given the information, the author's choice to end the friendship is their prerogative, even if it's a personal decision.\n"
