He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the friend got a teacher suspended for a month by reporting him after he made a joke. The teacher was known for dark humor and R-rated movies. The friend got offended, ran to the principal, and now the teacher's suspended.\n\nThe author is upset because they liked the teacher and think the joke wasn't serious. They ended the friendship. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend might have felt genuinely hurt or triggered by the joke. If the teacher said \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" even as a joke, that's a serious statement. If the friend took it seriously, especially if they have mental health issues, their reaction could be justified. The teacher's approach of making dark jokes might not be appropriate, but the friend's response led to his suspension.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher's suspension could have been unfair if it was just a joke. The author might feel betrayed that their friend didn't consider the teacher's intent. But the friend might have been in a vulnerable position and felt it was necessary to report the comment.\n\nThe author ended the friendship, which could be seen as a harsh reaction. If the friend didn't know the teacher's history of humor, maybe they overreacted, but the author is now cutting ties, which might be too extreme. However, the author might feel the friend's action disrupted their class and teacher. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. If the teacher's behavior was inappropriate, the friend might have a point. But if the joke was in line with his usual style and the friend misunderstood, then the friend might have overreacted. The author's decision to end the friendship is a personal choice, but does that make them in the wrong? It depends on whether the friend's action was justified. \n\nIf the teacher's joke was genuinely harmful, then the friend's action was right, and the author is wrong to end the friendship. If the joke was a typical joke and the friend took it wrong, maybe the author is justified. But since the teacher was suspended, it's possible the school saw it as inappropriate. However, the author's lack of understanding of the friend's perspective might be the issue. \n\nIn the end, the author's response was to end the friendship without knowing the friend's full story. That could be a hasty decision. If the friend had mental health issues, the joke could have been especially damaging. The author might not have all the facts but acted on their own judgment. So maybe the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend without considering possible underlying issues.\n"
