He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship because their friend got a teacher suspended. The situation involves a teacher who made a joke that the student took seriously, leading to suspension.\n\nFirst, the teacher was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, so the context matters. The friend in question is described as getting easily offended. The joke \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" was likely meant as a dark humor comment, but the student reacted strongly, leading to the teacher's suspension.\n\nThe author is upset because they liked the teacher and felt the friend overreacted. They ended the friendship over this. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the friend might have felt genuinely hurt or triggered by the joke, especially if they have mental health issues. Reporting the comment could be their way of seeking help. On the other hand, the teacher's behavior might be inappropriate, even if it's humor. Schools have policies against certain types of comments, so the suspension might be warranted.\n\nThe author is ending the friendship because they think the friend overstepped. But is it right to end a friendship over someone else's actions? The author's decision could be seen as holding the friend responsible for the teacher's suspension, which might not be fair. However, if the teacher's behavior was part of a pattern of inappropriate jokes, the friend's reaction could be justified.\n\nThe key points: Was the teacher's comment truly inappropriate? Did the friend have a history of being sensitive? The author doesn't know the friend's mental health background. Ending a friendship over this might be hasty without understanding the full context. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and the potential seriousness of the teacher's remarks. Alternatively, the friend might have taken the joke too seriously. But the author's reaction (ending the friendship) could be seen as extreme, especially if they didn't have a long history. So, maybe A is the answer here. But I'm a bit torn because sometimes people have boundaries about how others act. Hmm.\n"
