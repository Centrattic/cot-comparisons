He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The situation is that the teacher made a joke that was taken seriously, leading to suspension. The friend is described as someone who gets easily offended.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher was known for dark humor and R-rated movies. He might have thought the joke was in line with his usual style. But saying \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" is pretty harsh, even as a joke. That could be hurtful, regardless of intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's reaction led to the teacher being suspended. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and the class. They ended the friendship, which is a big step. The key points here are intent vs. impact. The teacher might not have meant to be malicious, but the impact on the student was significant. The friend might have felt targeted or vulnerable, leading her to involve the principal and her mom.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is a bit tricky. They didn't cause the situation, but they're cutting off a friend because of how the friend reacted. However, the friend's actions did lead to a teacher losing their job for a month. The author might feel that their friend overreacted, but they don't know the friend's history or mental state. Maybe the friend had a history of being triggered by such comments, which the author isn't aware of.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. Ending a friendship is a serious decision, especially over something that could be seen as a misunderstanding. But the friend's actions had real consequences for the teacher. However, the friend's mental health and feelings are also important. The author didn't confront the friend first, which might be a point against them. They just ended the friendship without discussing it, possibly without understanding the full context.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions could be seen as hasty. They didn't know the friend's background, so they might not have all the information. Ending a friendship for a single incident, especially without communication, could be considered impulsive. On the other hand, the friend's actions had significant repercussions, which might justify some frustration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't commit any wrongdoing in the sense that they have the right to end a friendship if they feel it's affecting their well-being. But the way they handled it\u2014without seeking to understand the friend's perspective\u2014might be problematic. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the friendship, but the situation is complex. However, some might argue that they should have approached it differently. The key is that the author is not wrong for prioritizing their own feelings, especially given the friend's history of being easily offended. But the abruptness and lack of communication could be a factor. Hmm, this is a tough call. Maybe the answer is B, but there's nuance.\n"
