He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong for ending a friendship because their friend got a teacher suspended. The situation is that the teacher, who was known for making dark jokes and being popular with students, made a joke about considering suicide to the friend. The friend took it seriously, reported him, and the teacher got suspended. The author is upset about losing the teacher's class, so they ended the friendship. Now the question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher was known for joking, but what he said could be seen as crossing a line, even if intended as a joke. The student might have mental health issues or a low threshold for such comments. However, the teacher's actions might have been inappropriate, even if they were meant as a joke. On the other hand, the friend's reaction led to the suspension of a teacher who others liked. The author is upset that their friend took that action, leading to a loss of their class and suspension of a teacher they liked.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it right to end a friendship over this? The friend might have felt targeted or hurt, especially if they have a history of being sensitive or mental health struggles. The teacher's joke, while maybe meant as a joke, could be harmful. However, the friend's response might have been overly reactive, but maybe justified if they felt unsafe or triggered. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend, which could be seen as being loyal to the teacher they liked over supporting a friend who was clearly affected by the incident.\n\nBut the author didn't know the friend's full story. The friend's mental health history isn't known, so the author might not be in a position to judge. Ending a friendship because someone else's actions (the friend's) led to a suspension of someone the author liked might be considered inconsiderate. The author is prioritizing their own experience over the friend's well-being, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if the teacher's joke was inappropriate regardless of intent, then the friend was right to report it. But the author is upset because their friend caused the suspension. But the author's anger is directed at the friend, not the teacher. That seems harsh. The friend might have felt they had no other recourse. Without knowing the context of the friend's mental state, the author's judgment could be hasty. So the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without understanding the full situation.\n\nBut then again, the author could have tried to mediate or understand. Ending a friendship is a big step. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). But wait, the teacher's actions could be questionable. However, the friend's overreaction might be valid if they felt unsafe. The author is punishing the friend for speaking out. So the author is in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
