He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The situation involves a teacher who made a joke that the friend took seriously, leading to his suspension.\n\nFirst, the teacher in question, T, was known for making dark jokes and not holding back. The friend in question is described as someone who gets easily offended. The teacher made a joke asking the friend if she had considered killing herself, which the friend took seriously and reported. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and blame the friend for the suspension, leading them to end the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the teacher's comment a serious threat or a joke? The friend interpreted it as serious, but the teacher claims it was a joke. The friend's reaction led to the suspension. The author is angry at the friend for causing this outcome.\n\nThe author is now questioning if they're in the wrong for ending the friendship. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the friend might have overreacted if the teacher was joking. But on the other hand, making a joke about suicide is inappropriate and potentially harmful, regardless of intent. If the teacher did say that as a joke in class, it's unprofessional and could be a breach of conduct. Schools have policies against such remarks, so the suspension might be justified. However, if the friend didn't know the teacher's history or context, she might have acted out of fear or past trauma.\n\nThe author is cutting off the friend because they believe the friend went too far. However, the friend might have a valid reason if she felt genuinely threatened. The author isn't considering possible underlying issues the friend might have. Ending a friendship over this could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. \n\nBut the teacher's behavior was also questionable. If the teacher was making jokes like that regularly, the friend's reporting could be a positive action. The author is angry at the friend instead of addressing the teacher's behavior. That might show a lack of empathy towards the friend's perspective.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's potential valid reasons for reporting the teacher. Ending the friendship without understanding the full context could be harsh. The author is prioritizing their preference for the teacher over the friend's experience, which isn't fair if the friend acted out of concern for her well-being.\n"
