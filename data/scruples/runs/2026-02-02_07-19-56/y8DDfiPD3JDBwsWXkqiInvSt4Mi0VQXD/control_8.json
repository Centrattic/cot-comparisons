He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship because their friend got a teacher suspended. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and inappropriate remarks. He was popular with students and used a more relaxed approach in his AP Human Geography class, which had mostly seniors. The friend, who is in another class with T (US History), apparently got offended by a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend took it seriously, ran to the principal, and with her mom's support, led to the teacher being suspended for a month. The author liked the teacher and felt the friend overreacted, so they ended the friendship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's reaction and the author's response. The teacher's behavior could be problematic. Making a joke about suicide, even if meant as a joke, is a serious issue. However, if the teacher was known for dark humor, maybe the friend overreacted? But on the other hand, if the joke was actually hurtful or crossed a line, then the friend might have a valid reason to report it. \n\nThe author is upset because they liked the teacher and found the friend's action extreme. But is ending the friendship justified? The author doesn't know the friend's mental health or background. The friend is now disliked by others, which might be a result of her action. \n\nLegally, if the teacher was creating a hostile environment, the school might have a responsibility to act. But if the teacher's humor was a known part of his teaching style and the friend took it the wrong way, maybe the friend's reaction was over the top. However, a joke about suicide is a red flag. Even if the teacher didn't mean it seriously, it's a sensitive topic. The school's response (suspended for a month) shows they took it seriously. \n\nThe author's reaction: cutting off a new friend over this. Is that too harsh? The friend might have acted impulsively, but the author's response is to end the friendship without knowing the full context of the friend's situation. Maybe they should have talked to the friend first, tried to understand her perspective, and then decided. Ending the friendship immediately could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, the author's fault is not being understanding and cutting off a friend without knowing all the details. The friend might have had a reason to feel threatened or triggered, but the author assumes she's just oversensitive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship without considering the friend's possible valid reasons and without communication."
