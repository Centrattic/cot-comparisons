He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship after the teacher got suspended.\n\nFirst, the situation: The teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. He was popular with students. The friend, who's been a friend for a few months, got offended by a joke where the teacher said \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" She took it to the principal, her mom supported her, and he was suspended. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and the class was fun. They ended the friendship because of this, and now the friend is disliked. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the teacher's joke could have been inappropriate. Even if he meant it as a joke, saying something like that to a student could be harmful, especially if the student is sensitive. The friend might have a right to feel hurt or taken that seriously. On the other hand, if the teacher was known for dark humor and the students were used to it, maybe the friend overreacted. But the author is ending the friendship because of this, which is a big step.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ending a friendship is a personal choice. If the author felt that the friend's actions were causing harm (by getting the teacher suspended when the teacher was well-liked and the joke seemed in line with his usual style), maybe they're right to be upset. But is it their place to take sides in a situation where they don't know the full story of the friend's mental health or past? The author admitted they don't know the friend's history, so maybe they're making a judgment without all the facts. Also, the friend might have legitimate reasons for being triggered.\n\nHowever, the author is ending the friendship entirely because of this. That's a drastic measure. Even if they're upset, cutting off a friend over this might be too much. The friend might have acted in a way that others disagree with, but is that a reason to end the friendship? It depends on the relationship. The author is taking a side in a conflict they weren't part of. They might be assuming the teacher was in the right, which could be valid, but if the friend was genuinely hurt, the author's reaction could be seen as dismissing her feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong by cutting off the friend without understanding the full context, especially since they don't know the friend's history. But if the author feels the teacher was unfairly targeted, maybe they have a point. But ending a friendship is a big deal. The key here is the author's decision to end the friendship, not the initial action of the friend. The friend's action led to the teacher's suspension, but the author's response is the issue here.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they ended the friendship without fully understanding the situation and possibly without considering the friend's perspective. So the answer would be A.\n"
