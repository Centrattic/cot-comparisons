He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a teacher, T, who was suspended after making a joke that offended the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author liked the teacher a lot and thought the teacher's jokes were part of his humor. The friend, on the other hand, took offense to a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend reported this, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author ended the friendship because they believed the friend overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are: the teacher's intent (he meant it as a joke), the friend's reaction (took it seriously and went to the principal), and the author's decision to end the friendship because they supported the teacher.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they value the teacher's class and humor, and they see the friend as overly sensitive. They might feel that the friend's actions were disproportionate and that the teacher's suspension was unjust because it was a joke.\n\nOn the other side, the friend might have felt genuinely hurt or triggered by the teacher's comment, especially if she has mental health issues or a history of being sensitive. Her mother supported her, so maybe there's a valid concern about the teacher's conduct, even if it was a joke. The teacher's behavior could be seen as crossing a line, especially in an educational setting where such jokes might not be appropriate, regardless of intent.\n\nThe author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as cutting off a friend based on their actions, which might be hurtful. But if the author felt that the friend was being unreasonably sensitive and causing a problem they supported, maybe they think the friend is the one in the wrong.\n\nHowever, the teacher was suspended, which indicates the school took the friend's complaint seriously. So, even if the joke was meant in a light-hearted way, there's a possibility that the teacher's comment was inappropriate. The author might not have considered the friend's perspective or her potential mental health struggles, which the author admits to not knowing much about.\n\nIn terms of friendship, if the author values a supportive relationship and the friend's actions led to a conflict that the author couldn't reconcile, maybe ending the friendship is a way to protect their own feelings. But if the friend's actions were based on a legitimate need to feel safe, then the author might be dismissing her feelings without understanding.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for ending the friendship. If the author didn't consider the friend's perspective and mental health, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the friend overreacted and the author felt their support for the teacher was important, then maybe not.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the friend's action was reasonable. Since the teacher was suspended, the school deemed it a valid issue. The author might have been too quick to judge the friend without knowing her full story. Ending the friendship seems harsh if the friend had legitimate reasons for her reaction. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not trying to understand before cutting off the friendship.\n"
