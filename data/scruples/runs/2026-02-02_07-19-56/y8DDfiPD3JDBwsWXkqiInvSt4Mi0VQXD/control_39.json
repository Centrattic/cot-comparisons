He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend getting a teacher suspended by taking a joke the wrong way. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and was popular. The friend, who gets easily offended, took a joke about suicide seriously and reported the teacher, leading to his suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and ended the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend might have been justified if the teacher actually made a harmful comment, but the teacher claimed it was a joke. However, saying \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" can be a really hurtful statement, even if intended as a joke. If the friend felt threatened or targeted, they might have acted out of self-defense. But the teacher's behavior could also be a pattern of inappropriate remarks, which the school might have reason to address.\n\nOn the other hand, the author ended the friendship because they were upset about losing the teacher. That seems harsh. The friend might have overreacted, but the author's response of cutting off the friendship seems extreme. The author didn't consider the friend's perspective or possible mental health issues. They didn't try to communicate or understand why the friend reacted that way. Ending a friendship over someone else's mistake without understanding the full context could be hasty.\n\nAlso, the teacher was suspended for a month, which is a significant consequence. If the friend's actions led to that, maybe there's a deeper issue. But the author didn't check if the friend had valid reasons, like a history of being bullied or mental health struggles. The author just assumed the friend was wrong and punished them by ending the friendship. That seems unfair. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being empathetic and for overreacting to the situation without getting the full story.\n"
