He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a teacher getting suspended because a student took a joke the wrong way. The author ends the friendship with their friend who caused this, right?\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. The friend, who the author just met, took one of those jokes seriously and reported him. The teacher then got suspended for a month. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and his class, and they're cutting off the friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship. Let's break it down. The friend's actions led to the suspension. But was the friend in the right to report the teacher? If the teacher wasn't being serious, but the friend felt genuinely hurt or threatened, maybe there's nuance here. However, from the author's perspective, the friend overreacted, leading to the suspension of a well-liked teacher. The author ends the friendship because of this, which is a big move.\n\nNow, considering the author's stance: they ended the friendship without knowing the friend's background. Maybe the friend has mental health issues or a history of being sensitive. The author doesn't know that, so they just cut off the friend. Is that fair? It's possible the friend didn't intend to ruin the teacher's career but still overreacted. But ending a friendship over someone else's mistake might be harsh.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher might have crossed a line, even if joking. If the joke was in poor taste, the friend might have a point in reporting it. On the other hand, if it was clearly a joke and the friend took it the wrong way, then the friend's reaction was excessive. The author is punishing the friend for the teacher's mistake, which might not be fair. The friend might be struggling with something, and the author isn't considering that. The author's action (ending the friendship) is a personal consequence for the friend's actions towards a third party, which could be seen as the author taking sides without full context.\n\nBut then again, if the teacher was treated harshly for a joke, maybe the friend was at fault. However, the author is ending a friendship based on that, which is a significant response. The author might be in the wrong because they're cutting off someone who might have had valid reasons, even if they reacted poorly. Without knowing the friend's history, the author is making a judgment, which could be unfair.\n\nHmm. So, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong. Ending a friendship over this might be too harsh without knowing the full story of the friend's mental state or the teacher's actual intentions. The author is holding the friend responsible for a suspension that might not have been entirely justified, and the friendship is being terminated based on that. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
