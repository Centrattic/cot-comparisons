He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a teacher who was suspended after making an inappropriate joke that the author's friend took seriously. The author is now cutting off the friend because they think the friend overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The teacher, T, is described as someone who makes dark jokes and shows R-rated movies, which suggests that he's used to a certain level of humor. The friend in question is someone who gets easily offended. The teacher made a joke asking if she had considered killing herself, which the friend took seriously and reported, leading to his suspension. The author is upset that the friend caused this suspension and ended the friendship.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the friend overreacted, and the teacher wasn't being serious. But the problem here is that the teacher's joke was inappropriate, even if he didn't mean it. Making a joke about suicide, while not intending harm, can still be harmful and potentially offensive. The teacher's actions crossed a line into what could be considered a serious breach of professional conduct. \n\nFrom the friend's perspective, they felt hurt or threatened by the joke, which might indicate that they have legitimate emotional issues or a history of mental health challenges. The friend's reaction led to the teacher's suspension, which the author is upset about. But the author doesn't know the friend's history, so maybe the friend's reaction was justified based on their personal experiences.\n\nThe author is ending the friendship because they believe the friend was wrong to report the teacher. However, the teacher's behavior was questionable. Even if the joke was a mistake, the friend's action was part of a school's reporting system, which is in place to address such issues. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and for prioritizing their feelings about the teacher over the friend's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, if the teacher's joke was clearly in line with his usual behavior and the friend is prone to taking things the wrong way, the author might feel justified in ending the friendship. But the key point here is that the teacher's joke was inappropriate regardless of intent. The friend's action, while possibly overzealous, was a reaction to a teacher crossing a line. The author's responsibility here is to consider both sides: the friend's feelings and the teacher's misconduct. Since the author doesn't know the friend's history, it's possible that the friend's reaction was a legitimate response to a teacher who consistently made inappropriate remarks.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the teacher's inappropriate behavior and for cutting off the friend without understanding their perspective. The teacher's joke was a serious issue, and the friend's action, though leading to the suspension, was a response to a teacher who repeatedly made dark, potentially harmful comments. The author's friendship ended because they prioritized their own enjoyment of the teacher's class over the friend's well-being, which could be seen as insensitive.\n"
