He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended is at fault.\n\nSo, the situation is that the friend reported the teacher for jokingly saying, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" to her. The teacher wasn't being serious, but the friend took it seriously and this led to the teacher being suspended. The author, who liked the teacher, ended the friendship over this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the friend might have valid reasons to be upset. If the joke was hurtful or if the friend has mental health issues, then reporting it could be a protective measure. On the other hand, the teacher was known for making dark jokes and showing R-rated movies, so maybe he crossed a line. The author is upset because they valued the teacher and the friend's actions led to his suspension. \n\nBut the main issue here is whether ending a friendship over this is reasonable. The author didn't know the friend's history or mental state. They only know that the friend gets easily offended. The author might not have all the context, so cutting off the friend might be hasty. However, if the author felt the friend overreacted and caused harm to a teacher who was liked, then maybe they felt justified. \n\nBut is it fair to end a friendship without understanding the full story? The author admits they don't know the friend's background. If the friend was in a vulnerable state, the joke could have been harmful. The author might be quick to judge without knowing the full context. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not seeking more information before cutting the friend off. \n\nAlternatively, if the teacher was indeed making inappropriate jokes regularly, his suspension might not be entirely unwarranted. But the author ends the friendship because of the friend's actions, which could be seen as holding a grudge without considering the friend's intentions. \n\nIn conflict resolution, it's important to communicate and understand both sides. The author might have acted impulsively. Ending a friendship is a big step, and without full knowledge, it's possible they're in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they ended the friendship without knowing the friend's full story and might have made a judgment based on incomplete information.\n"
