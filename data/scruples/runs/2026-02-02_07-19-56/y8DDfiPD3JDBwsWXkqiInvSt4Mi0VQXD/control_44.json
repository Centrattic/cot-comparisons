He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. So first, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. The friend got offended by a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" even though it was meant as a joke. The friend ran to the principal, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and found the friend's reaction over the top. Now, the author ended the friendship and is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the teacher's comment is problematic. Making a joke about suicide, even if intended as a joke, can be hurtful. It's a sensitive topic, and such remarks can be triggering. The friend might have a history of mental health issues, which isn't mentioned here. Without knowing that context, the friend's reaction could be seen as disproportionate, but maybe not entirely wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher was suspended for a month, which seems like a significant consequence. The author is upset because they valued the teacher's class and feel the friend went too far. But ending a friendship over this seems harsh. The author didn't consider the friend's perspective, maybe didn't communicate. The friend might have felt genuinely hurt or unsafe, leading to her reaction. The author's response of cutting off the friend without understanding her reasons could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nSo the question is: Is ending the friendship unjustified? The author's reasoning is based on their own experience with the teacher, but they don't know the friend's background. The friend's action led to a suspension, but the author is punishing her for that. However, the teacher's behavior was also questionable. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and cutting ties without discussion. Alternatively, the friend overreacted, so the author isn't wrong. But given the lack of context about the friend's mental health, it's possible she had valid reasons. The author's decision to end the friendship without knowing more might be hasty. Therefore, the answer could be AITA for the author, meaning they are in the wrong.\n"
