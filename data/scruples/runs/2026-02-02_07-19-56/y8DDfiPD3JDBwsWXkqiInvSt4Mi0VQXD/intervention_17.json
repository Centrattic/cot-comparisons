He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the friend got a teacher suspended because the teacher made a joke that the friend took seriously. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, and this was part of his usual style. The friend ran to the principal and the teacher got suspended. The author is upset about this and ended the friendship. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher's actions: he was making jokes, which is part of his teaching style. He's been doing this before, and the students generally liked him. The joke he made was \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" which is a serious topic. The friend took it as a threat, even though the teacher wasn't serious. The friend's reaction led to the teacher's suspension, which the author is upset about because they liked the teacher.\n\nNow, the author's perspective: they ended the friendship because they think the friend overreacted. They didn't know the friend's history with mental health or anything else, just that she gets offended easily. The author is now cutting off the friend because of this incident.\n\nThe question is whether ending the friendship was wrong. On one hand, the friend might have had a valid reason to feel threatened, especially if she has a history of mental health issues. But the author doesn't know that. On the other hand, the teacher's actions were part of his usual style, and the friend's reaction caused a suspension. The author is upset about the teacher being gone and is punishing the friend for it.\n\nI think the key points here are the teacher's intent versus the friend's reaction. If the teacher wasn't being serious, but the friend took it as a threat, that's a sensitive situation. However, the friend's response was to go to the principal and get the teacher suspended, which might not have been the best approach. But the author is ending a friendship based on that action, without understanding the friend's possible mental health context. That seems a bit harsh. The author is punishing the friend for something they didn't know about, and the friend might be in a vulnerable spot. However, the teacher was making jokes that could be hurtful, even if not meant to be. It's a tough call. If the author is cutting off the friend without knowing their history, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the teacher was just being a jerk and the friend overreacted, then the author might be justified. But I think the author hasn't considered the friend's potential vulnerabilities, so maybe they are in the wrong.\n"
