He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making jokes, even dark ones, and students liked him. The author's friend, who's the one who reported the teacher, got offended when T made a joke about considering suicide. The friend took it seriously, went to the principal, and the teacher was suspended. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and the class environment. They ended the friendship because of this. Now, they're wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the teacher's intent versus the friend's reaction. The teacher was joking, but the joke was about a sensitive topic. The friend took it seriously, which led to the suspension. The author is mad at the friend for ruining their class and the teacher's situation. \n\nBut wait, is the teacher's joke inappropriate? Even if it was a joke, saying \"Have you considered killing yourself?\" could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's directed at a student. Teachers should be cautious about what they say, but also, students have different sensitivities. The friend might have a history of mental health issues that made the joke more harmful. The author doesn't know the friend's background, which complicates things.\n\nThe author ended the friendship because they were upset with the friend's actions. But is that fair? The friend might have felt that the teacher's comment was harmful, even if it was a joke. The author is prioritizing their own feelings about losing a fun class over the friend's actions. However, the friend might have acted out of concern for their own well-being or the teacher's potential to say more harmful things.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher's suspension might have been an overreaction if it was just a joke. On the other hand, if the friend felt genuinely targeted or if the teacher made a habit of making inappropriate jokes, the friend might have been justified in taking action. Since the author doesn't know the friend's full context, it's hard to judge. But the author is ending the friendship without understanding the friend's perspective. That seems hasty. Ending a friendship because someone took a joke seriously might be inconsiderate. The friend might have had valid reasons, and the author's reaction could be dismissive of that.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong. They didn't try to understand the friend's side, and their friendship was ended based on their own anger towards the situation. Therefore, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure. If the teacher's joke was clearly a non-issue, then the friend's action was overstepping. But if the joke was genuinely inappropriate, the friend might have a point. Since the teacher was suspended, the school saw it as a serious issue. The author is upset about losing their class, but the friend's action led to a significant consequence. The author's reaction seems to be based on their own loss rather than considering the friend's motivation. So, it's possible the author is in the wrong.\n"
