He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a teacher getting suspended because a student took a joke the wrong way. The friend reported the teacher, leading to a suspension, and the narrator ended the friendship because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher made a joke, which he obviously didn't mean seriously. But the student took offense and escalated it, resulting in the teacher losing a month of work. The narrator liked the teacher a lot and is upset with the friend for causing that. Now, the question is, is ending the friendship justified?\n\nOn one hand, the teacher wasn't being malicious. Dark humor is common, but there's a line. If the joke crossed that line and made the student feel unsafe, then maybe the student had a right to report it. However, if the teacher's intention was clearly a joke and the student overreacted, then maybe the friend overstepped. \n\nBut the narrator ended the friendship without knowing the full context of their friend's mental health or background. The friend might have had reasons to be triggered, like past mental health issues. The narrator didn't consider that and just cut off the friendship because they liked the teacher. That seems hasty. \n\nAlso, the narrator didn't try to understand their friend's perspective. They just acted based on their own feelings towards the teacher. Ending a friendship over this without communication might be the wrong move. The friend might have felt justified, and the teacher might have been negligent in not being careful with his comments. \n\nSo, the narrator is being judgmental without all the facts. They assumed the friend was wrong without knowing her history. That's probably why the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they ended the friendship without understanding the full situation of their friend and the teacher's actions.\n"
