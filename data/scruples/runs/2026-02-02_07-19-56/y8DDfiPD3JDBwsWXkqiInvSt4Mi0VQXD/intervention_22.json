He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The teacher, T, is described as making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which students liked. The friend, who the author just started hanging out with, got offended when the teacher made a joke about suicide. She went to the principal, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and ended the friendship over this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher's behavior, the friend's reaction, and the author's decision to end the friendship. The author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the teacher was making inappropriate jokes, which could be harmful, especially if someone is vulnerable. The friend might have a valid reason to feel upset and seek help. On the other hand, the teacher wasn't being serious, and the friend's action led to the suspension, which affected many students who liked the teacher.\n\nThe author ended the friendship without knowing the friend's background. Maybe the friend has mental health issues and needed to report the behavior. The author might be in the wrong for cutting ties without understanding the friend's perspective. But then again, the friend's action caused harm to others' education. \n\nIt's a tough call. If the teacher's jokes were indeed inappropriate and the friend acted out of concern, maybe the author should have considered that. However, ending a friendship abruptly without knowing the full story could be hasty. The author might have overreacted, assuming the teacher was in the right when the jokes were inappropriate. \n\nBut the friend's action led to a suspension, which disrupted the class. The author values the teacher's class highly, so their anger is understandable. However, the friend might have felt justified in reporting the teacher. The author's reaction could be seen as not standing by a friend when they were in a conflict, especially if the friend had valid reasons.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding the friend's perspective and ending the friendship without considering the potential seriousness of the teacher's remarks. Alternatively, if the teacher's behavior was inappropriate, the friend's action is justified, and the author's loyalty might be misplaced. However, the author's lack of knowledge about the friend's background complicates things. Given that, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friendship without fully understanding the situation.\n"
