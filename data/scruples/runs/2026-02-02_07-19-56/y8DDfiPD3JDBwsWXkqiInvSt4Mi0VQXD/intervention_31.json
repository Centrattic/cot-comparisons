He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who got a teacher suspended by reporting a joke the teacher made. The author is upset about losing the teacher and ended the friendship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher, T, made a joke that was taken seriously. The friend reported the teacher, leading to a suspension. The author is now cutting ties with the friend because of this.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher was known for making dark or inappropriate jokes, which might be part of his teaching style. If the joke was clearly meant in a humorous way and not malicious, then the friend's reaction might be over the top. The friend might have had a sensitive reaction, but maybe there was a misunderstanding. The teacher could have crossed a line even if he thought it was a joke. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have a valid reason to feel hurt or threatened, especially if they have a history of mental health issues. The teacher's statement could be perceived as harmful, even if not intended. The friend's action led to the teacher's suspension, which affects many students who liked him. The author is upset because they valued the teacher's class and feel the friend didn't consider that.\n\nThe author ended the friendship, which is a significant action. The question is whether that's justified. The author mentions they don't know the friend's history or mental state. Ending a friendship over this might be too harsh, especially without understanding the friend's perspective. However, the friend's action did have real consequences, so maybe the author is justified in being upset.\n\nBut is it right to cut someone off entirely over this? The friend might not have intended to hurt the author, but their actions did. It's possible the author is in the wrong if they didn't give the friend a chance to explain or if the friend's reaction was proportionate. However, if the friend acted recklessly without considering the impact, the author might have a point. \n\nI think the key points are: Did the teacher genuinely overstep, even as a joke? Was the friend justified in reporting it? And how does that affect the author's decision to end the friendship. If the friend acted inconsiderately, maybe the author isn't wrong. But if the teacher's joke was harmful and the friend was in the right to report it, then the author is in the wrong for cutting the friend off. \n\nGiven that the teacher was suspended, the school likely saw the statement as inappropriate. So maybe the friend's action was appropriate, and the author is wrong to end the friendship. The author's anger might stem from personal loss rather than considering the friend's possible valid reasons. So the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
