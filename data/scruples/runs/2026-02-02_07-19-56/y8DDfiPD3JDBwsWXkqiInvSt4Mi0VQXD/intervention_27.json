He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The situation is that the teacher made a joke that the friend took seriously, leading to his suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and the friend is now disliked.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The teacher is known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which most students liked. The friend, who the author mentions gets easily offended, took a joke about suicide seriously and reported it, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author then ends the friendship over this, feeling the teacher was wrongfully suspended.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. Let me consider both sides. The friend's action, while maybe overreacting, was likely out of genuine concern for her mental health. Teachers shouldn't make jokes about suicide, even if meant as a joke, because it's a sensitive topic. The friend might have a history of being vulnerable, which the author didn't know. On the other hand, the teacher was suspended, which could be a consequence of the friend's actions, but the teacher's behavior was already problematic.\n\nThe author's reaction is to end the friendship. Ending a relationship because someone took a joke seriously and reported it might be cutting off without understanding the friend's perspective. The author didn't consider the friend's mental state or the potential harm of the joke. The teacher's suspension is a consequence that affects the entire class, but the friend's action was a response to a personal trigger.\n\nSo, the author's judgment here is based on their preference for the teacher over their friend. Without knowing the friend's background, the author assumes the teacher was just joking and the friend overreacted. However, the friend might have a valid reason for being triggered. The author is dismissing the friend's feelings and not considering the possibility that the friend was in a vulnerable state. Therefore, the author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as inconsiderate and not taking the friend's well-being into account.\n"
