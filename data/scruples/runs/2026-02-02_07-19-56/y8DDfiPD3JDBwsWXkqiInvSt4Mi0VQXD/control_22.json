He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe situation is that the author's friend got a teacher suspended for a month. The teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, and was popular with students. The friend, who the author met in junior year, is described as someone who gets offended easily. The friend was in T's US History class. The incident happened when T said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" as a joke. The friend took offense, went to the principal, and the teacher got suspended. The author now ended the friendship, and the friend is disliked by their grade. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The teacher made a joke that was taken seriously, leading to suspension. The friend reported the teacher, possibly overreacted. The author is upset because the teacher was liked and the class was enjoyable. The author ended the friendship because of this.\n\nNow, considering the friend's perspective: if the teacher made a comment that could be seen as triggering or hurtful, even as a joke, the friend might have felt unsafe or targeted. Especially if the friend has mental health issues or a history of being sensitive, the joke could have been harmful. Even if the teacher intended it as a joke, the impact on the student is real. The friend's response led to the suspension, which might be seen as a necessary consequence if the teacher's behavior was inappropriate.\n\nOn the author's side, they ended the friendship because they liked the teacher and thought the friend overreacted. But the teacher's actions, even as jokes, could be problematic. The teacher's behavior might have crossed boundaries, especially if it involved threatening comments. The author is punishing the friend for the consequences of the teacher's actions, which could be seen as unfair if the friend was genuinely harmed by the joke.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider the friend's perspective and the potential trauma from the joke. However, if the friend's reaction was disproportionate and the teacher was just being playful, the author's anger makes sense. But without knowing the friend's mental health history, the author's judgment might be hasty.\n\nAnother angle: the author ended the friendship without understanding the full context. If the friend had a valid reason (e.g., was struggling with suicidal thoughts), then the teacher's comment was serious. But the story doesn't mention the friend's mental state. The author is taking a side against the friend based on the outcome of the suspension, not the actual events. It's possible the friend's action was necessary if the teacher's behavior was harmful, even if it was meant as a joke.\n\nIn educational settings, teachers should maintain appropriate boundaries. Making jokes about self-harm could be a violation of school policies. If the friend reported this and the school took action, maybe it's a case of the friend doing the right thing. The author, however, is cutting off the friend for causing the suspension, which might be dismissing the friend's experience.\n\nBut the author might not know the whole story. Without knowing if the friend was in a vulnerable position, the author could be making a judgment based on limited information. Ending a friendship over this might be too harsh. The teacher's suspension could be a result of the school's policies, not just the friend's reaction. However, the author is upset because they lost a teacher they liked, and that's leading to anger towards the friend.\n\nBalancing these perspectives: The author's reaction could be seen as prioritizing the teacher's well-being and the class enjoyment over the friend's potential mental health. But if the friend's action was necessary to address harmful behavior, the author is wrong to abandon the friend. On the other hand, if the friend overreacted to a harmless joke, the author's stance is understandable.\n\nThe key here is whether the teacher's comment was genuinely harmful. If it was a joke taken the wrong way, the friend's reaction might be excessive. However, comments about self-harm, even as jokes, can be deeply hurtful and should be taken seriously. The school's suspension of the teacher indicates that they found the comment unacceptable. So, maybe the friend did the right thing, and the author is wrong to end the friendship.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they are punishing the friend for taking a stand against inappropriate behavior, even though it led to the teacher's suspension. The friend's action was within her right to report a comment that could be harmful, and the author's response is cutting off a friend without fully understanding the context.\n"
