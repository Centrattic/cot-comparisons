He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The situation involves a teacher who made a joke that was taken seriously, leading to suspension. The friend who reported the teacher is now being distanced by the author.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The teacher, T, was known for making dark and inappropriate jokes, including showing R-rated movies. The friend in question is someone who gets easily offended. The incident happened when the teacher made a joke asking the friend if she had considered killing herself, which was meant as a joke. The friend and her mother took it seriously enough to report it, leading to the teacher being suspended. The author, who liked the teacher and the class, is now upset and ended the friendship because of this.\n\nNow, considering the possible wrongdoings. The author is ending a friendship over this. The question is whether they are in the wrong. On one hand, the teacher's behavior could be problematic. Even if made as a joke, saying something like \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" is extremely sensitive and could be perceived as threatening or harmful, especially in a position of authority. Teachers have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, so even if intended as a joke, such remarks can cross a line. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's reaction led to the teacher's suspension. The author is upset that the friend took it seriously, which made the author lose a teacher they liked. The author's decision to end the friendship might be seen as a choice to side with the teacher over the friend. But is that fair? The author might feel betrayed because their friend caused the teacher's suspension, but they might not have considered the context of the friend's mental health or history. The author admits they don't know the friend's background, which could be important. If the friend has a history of mental health issues and was triggered by the comment, her reaction might be justified. However, the author isn't in a position to know that unless the friend shared it.\n\nThe teacher's behavior is questionable. Even if the joke was meant in a playful way, making a comment about suicide is extremely inappropriate and could be seen as a breach of professional conduct. Schools have policies about what teachers can and cannot say. If the teacher was making such jokes regularly, that's a problem. The friend's action might have been the straw that broke the camel's back, but the teacher's behavior was likely ongoing.\n\nThe author's reaction is cutting off a friend. Friendships require understanding and empathy. The author might be acting out of anger towards the friend for causing the suspension, but they might not be considering the friend's perspective. However, if the friend's action was disproportionate and the author feels strongly about supporting the teacher, ending the friendship could be seen as their choice. However, it's important to consider that the teacher's behavior might have been harmful, and the friend's action was a way to protect herself.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might be in the wrong if the teacher's actions were indeed inappropriate and the friend was just trying to protect herself. But if the teacher's joke was a one-time thing and the friend overreacted, then maybe the author's decision is justified. However, the teacher's ongoing behavior (dark jokes, R-rated movies) suggests a pattern that might be harmful, especially in an educational setting. The friend's action, while causing the suspension, could be seen as necessary for her own well-being.\n\nBut the question is about the author ending the friendship. The author is prioritizing their own feelings about losing a teacher over the friend's well-being. The friend might have felt unsafe, and the author is distancing themselves because of that. That could be considered selfish. However, the author might feel that the friend's action ruined something positive for them. It's a nuanced situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and the potential harm of the teacher's jokes. However, if the teacher's suspension was unnecessary, the author's reaction could be understandable. But given the teacher's history, it's more likely that the friend's action was justified, making the author's decision to end the friendship the wrong choice.\n"
