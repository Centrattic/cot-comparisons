He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and showing R-rated movies. The friend reported T for saying \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" as a joke, leading to T's suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and the friend is now disliked, so they ended the friendship.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The teacher's comment about suicide is a serious issue. Even if it was a joke, making such a statement could be harmful, especially if the student took it seriously. The friend might have felt threatened or hurt, leading her to report it. On the other hand, the teacher's intention was to be humorous, but the line was crossed. \n\nThe author cut off the friendship because they were angry about T being suspended. That seems harsh. The friend might have had valid reasons for feeling offended. The author didn't consider the friend's perspective, maybe didn't know her mental health history. Ending the friendship without understanding both sides could be seen as unfair. However, the teacher did get suspended, implying the school found the remark inappropriate. The author's reaction is based on disliking the consequences, not the action itself. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they ended the friendship without knowing the full story. They might have been too quick to judge their friend based on their own preferences for the teacher. The friend's actions led to a suspension, which is serious, but the author's response could be seen as cutting off someone without considering their intentions or mental state. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate with the friend and made a judgment based on their own feelings towards the teacher, not addressing the complex situation properly.\n"
