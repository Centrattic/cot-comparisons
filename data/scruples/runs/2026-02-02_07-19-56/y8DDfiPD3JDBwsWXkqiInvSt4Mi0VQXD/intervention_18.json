He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend got a teacher suspended for a month by taking a joke seriously. The teacher said something like \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" as a joke, but the friend took it as serious bullying and reported it. The author ended the friendship because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher made a joke that was inappropriate, even if it was meant as a joke. Saying something like that, even in a class full of students, could be hurtful. But the teacher had a reputation for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, so maybe the students were used to it. However, that doesn't excuse saying something that could be perceived as threatening, especially if it's about suicide. \n\nOn the friend's side, she might have a history of being sensitive to certain remarks. If she has mental health issues or a history of being triggered by such comments, her reaction might be justified. But the problem is that the author doesn't know her history. The friend ran to the principal and her mom supported her, leading to the teacher's suspension. \n\nThe author ended the friendship because they liked the teacher and felt the friend overreacted. The author might feel betrayed that the friend went to such lengths. But is cutting off a friend over this acceptable? Well, the friend's actions had real consequences: the teacher lost a month of work. The teacher might have been in the wrong for making that joke, but the friend escalated it to the point of suspension without knowing the full context. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend could have approached the teacher first to address the joke instead of immediately reporting it. If the teacher had a pattern of making such jokes, that's different, but the author mentions that the class was treated more informally. \n\nThe author is now avoiding the friend, possibly because they believe the friend overreacted. But maybe the author should have tried to understand the friend's perspective first. The author also mentions that the friend is now disliked by the majority of their grade, which might be a result of the incident. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend's action was a legitimate response to a harmful joke, then the author cutting off the friendship might be dismissing a serious issue. However, if the teacher's comment was a one-off joke in a context where students were used to similar humor, the friend's reaction might be overzealous. The author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as prioritizing the teacher's job over the friend's mental health, especially if the friend needed to speak up about something that affected her. \n\nBut without knowing the friend's mental health history, the author is making an assumption that the friend overreacted. The author might not have all the information. Still, ending a friendship is a significant action. It could be that the author is too quick to judge without understanding the friend's motivations. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for cutting ties without considering the friend's perspective and the potential seriousness of the teacher's comment.\n"
