He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ending a friendship because the friend got a teacher suspended.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, is described as making dark jokes and R-rated movies. The friend, who's the one causing the problem, got offended by a joke where the teacher said \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" and then reported him. The author ends the friendship because they liked the teacher and think the friend overreacted.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the teacher's intent and the friend's reaction. The teacher wasn't being serious, but the joke about suicide is pretty serious. Even if it's a joke, saying something like that could be hurtful. The friend might have a history of being sensitive, but the user doesn't know her mental state. \n\nHowever, the author ended the friendship because they were upset about the teacher being suspended. It's possible that the friend was acting out of concern for her well-being or safety. Even if the teacher meant it as a joke, making a comment about suicide is not appropriate. The friend might have had a legitimate reason to feel threatened or hurt, especially if she has a history of mental health issues. \n\nThe author is cutting off the friend without knowing her full story. That seems harsh. Ending a friendship because someone reported a teacher for a potentially harmful joke, without considering the friend's perspective, could be seen as unfair. The author might not have all the facts about why the friend reacted that way. \n\nSo, even though the teacher was well-liked and the class was fun, the author's decision to end the friendship could be inconsiderate. The friend might have done the right thing in reporting the teacher to protect herself or others. The author is quick to blame the friend without understanding her situation fully. That makes me think the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
