He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend got a teacher suspended by reporting a joke that the teacher made. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which were well-received by students. The friend, who tends to get easily offended, took offense to a joke where the teacher asked her if she'd considered killing herself. The friend then told the principal and her mom, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and the class, so they ended the friendship. Now, they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The teacher made a joke that was inappropriate, even if he meant it as a joke. Saying \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" to a student could be seen as triggering or harmful, especially if the student is vulnerable. However, the teacher's history of dark humor and the context of the class (with older students) might matter. If the teacher usually makes such jokes and the students are used to it, maybe the friend overreacted. But on the other hand, if the joke was taken out of context or if the student has mental health issues, then the teacher's comment could be genuinely hurtful.\n\nThe friend's actions led to the teacher being suspended. The author is upset because they valued the teacher's class. Ending a friendship over this might be a strong reaction. But the author might feel that the friend betrayed the teacher's trust or went too far. However, the friend might have felt that the joke was a serious issue, especially if she was affected by it. The author doesn't know the friend's mental state, which complicates things. \n\nThe author might be prioritizing their relationship with the teacher over their friend, but friends should support each other. However, if the teacher's actions are harmful, even if they meant it as a joke, the friend might have a valid reason to report it. The author is cutting ties because they don't like that the friend reported the teacher, but if the teacher's behavior was indeed inappropriate, then the friend is doing the right thing. The author could be in the wrong for not considering the severity of the teacher's actions and the friend's perspective.\n\nAlternatively, if the teacher has a history of dark humor that the students are accustomed to, maybe the joke wasn't intended to harm, and the friend overreacted. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong for ending the friendship because they supported the teacher they liked. But this is a tricky balance between supporting a friend and addressing potential harm from a teacher.\n\nI think the key points are whether the teacher's joke was genuinely harmful and if the friend had a valid reason to report it. If the teacher's behavior was abusive or crossed a line, then the friend was right to act, and the author is wrong for cutting the friend off. If the teacher's joke was within a context of accepted humor and the friend overreacted, then the author's action might be understandable. But since the author doesn't know the friend's mental health history, they might be making a judgment without full information. The author's reaction seems harsh regardless, but the rightness depends on the context of the joke and the friend's intent.\n"
