He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark, inappropriate jokes and showed R-rated movies. He was popular among students. The friend, who's the one who reported the teacher, is described as someone who gets easily offended. The incident happened in the friend's class, where the teacher made a joke about considering suicide, which wasn't taken as a joke by the friend. The teacher was suspended, and the author ended the friendship over this.\n\nSo, the author is upset because they liked the teacher and his class. They ended the friendship, and now the friend is disliked by others. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the teacher's joke might have been inappropriate, even if intended as a joke. Making a comment about suicide, even in a joking manner, could be hurtful. The friend might have felt targeted or genuinely offended. On the other hand, the teacher's history of boundary-pushing behavior (dark jokes, R-rated movies) suggests a pattern that might be problematic. The friend's reaction led to the suspension, which affected the author's experience.\n\nThe author ended the friendship because they valued the teacher. But ending a friendship over someone else's actions might be hasty, especially without understanding the full context. The author admits they don't know the friend's mental state or history, which could be a factor in how the friend reacted. The author might be prioritizing the teacher over the friend without fully considering if the friend had a valid reason.\n\nIn terms of friendship, loyalty is important, but so is empathy. If the author didn't confront the friend or try to understand their perspective before ending things, that could be a mistake. The author might be acting out of anger without considering the friend's possible justification. The friend might have had a legitimate reason to feel hurt or threatened by the teacher's comment, even if it was meant as a joke.\n\nSo, while the teacher's suspension is a consequence the author dislikes, the decision to end the friendship could stem from prioritizing their own feelings over the friend's. The author might not have the full story and is making a judgment based on their own perception. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without understanding the situation better.\n"
