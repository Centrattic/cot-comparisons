He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and showing R-rated movies. He was popular with students. The friend in question, who is described as getting easily offended, took offense to a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend reported this to the principal, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author, who liked the teacher, ended the friendship, feeling that the friend overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher's behavior was questionable (jokes about suicide), the friend took it seriously, and the author ended the friendship because they didn't agree with the friend's actions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher made a joke that could be seen as harmful, especially around sensitive topics like suicide. Even if it was a joke, making such a comment could be triggering. The friend might have felt hurt or threatened and decided to report it. The school has a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, so if the teacher's actions were inappropriate, the friend's reaction might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset that their friend caused the teacher's suspension. They might feel that the friend overreacted, not knowing the friend's personal history or mental health. The author ends the friendship because they disagree with the friend's decision, which could indicate a lack of empathy towards the friend's perspective.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author didn't have a lot of context about the friend's mental health or past experiences. The friend could have a history of mental health issues that made the joke particularly harmful. The teacher's joke, while maybe intended as a joke, can have serious consequences. The author is prioritizing their own feelings about the teacher over the friend's well-being, which might not be fair.\n\nAlso, ending a friendship because someone reported a serious concern seems harsh. The teacher was suspended for a month, which could be a necessary action to prevent a harmful environment. The author might not be considering that the friend acted out of a place of fear or trauma. Without more context, it's hard to say, but the author's decision to cut off the friendship might be seen as dismissive of the friend's actions and the potential seriousness of the teacher's comment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not fully understand the friend's actions, cutting off a friend without trying to understand their perspective and the potential severity of the teacher's joke could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's position could be in the wrong because they didn't take the time to empathize and understand the situation fully before ending the friendship.\n"
