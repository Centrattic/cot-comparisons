He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend got a teacher suspended by reporting a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The teacher wasn't being serious, but the friend took it seriously and escalated it to the principal, leading to his suspension.\n\nThe author is upset because they really liked the teacher and his class. They ended the friendship over this. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher made a joke that could be seen as inappropriate or offensive, even if he didn't mean it seriously. However, the friend's reaction led to the teacher's suspension, which might have been a harsh consequence. The author is upset that their friend caused this, but maybe the friend felt that the teacher's comment was harmful or made them feel unsafe. \n\nOn the other hand, the author ended a friendship over this. Ending a friendship is a big deal. The author might feel that the friend overreacted, but they didn't consider the friend's perspective. The friend might have mental health issues or have been triggered by the comment, making it a serious issue. Without knowing the friend's background, the author made a judgment call to end the friendship, which could be seen as being inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the teacher was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which might have been a pattern. The friend might have had enough and decided to take action, which could be justified if the teacher was creating a hostile environment. The author, however, valued the teacher's humor and the class being easy, so their reaction is based on losing someone they like. \n\nBut ending a friendship over someone reporting a teacher's inappropriate comment, even if it leads to suspension, might be too harsh. The author didn't consider the friend's mental state or the possibility that the friend genuinely felt harmed. The friend might have had a valid reason, even if the teacher intended it as a joke. The author's decision to cut off the friend without understanding their side could make them at fault.\n\nAlternatively, if the teacher's comment was a one-time joke and the friend overreacted, then the author might have a point. But the story mentions that the teacher made dark jokes regularly, so this might be part of a pattern. The friend might have been within their rights to report it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if a friend gets another friend suspended, it's understandable to be upset, but ending a friendship over that might be extreme unless there was malicious intent. The friend reported the teacher possibly because they felt unsafe, not to get them suspended. The author ending the friendship without knowing the full story could be seen as hasty. \n\nSo considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong because they ended the friendship without understanding the friend's perspective and the potential seriousness of the teacher's comment. The answer should be A.\n"
