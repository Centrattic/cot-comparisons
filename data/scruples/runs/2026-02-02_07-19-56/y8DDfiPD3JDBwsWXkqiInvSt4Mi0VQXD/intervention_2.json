He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend got the teacher suspended. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, is described as funny and liked by students. He makes dark jokes and inappropriate remarks, and even showed R-rated movies. The friend, who is relatively new to the author, is the type to get easily offended. The friend is in a different class with T (US History), while the author is in AP Human Geography with him. The teacher's class with the author is full of seniors, so he jokes around more there. \n\nThe incident: The teacher made a joke asking the friend if she's ever considered killing herself. He wasn't serious, but the friend ran to the principal, her mom supported her, and the teacher got suspended. The author is upset because they liked the teacher, and now the friend is disliked by many. The author ended the friendship. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLet me think. On one hand, the teacher was making jokes that students found acceptable, part of his humor. The friend took it seriously and reported it, leading to suspension. The author is upset because they valued the teacher and the friendship was new. Ending a friendship over this might be harsh, but maybe they felt betrayed. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have had valid reasons\u2014maybe she's dealing with mental health issues where a joke like that could be triggering. If the teacher was known for dark humor, but the line was crossed, the friend's reaction could be justified. The author didn't know the friend's history, so maybe they acted without full context. \n\nThe author is in the wrong if they judged the friend without understanding her perspective, especially if the friend had a reason to be sensitive. However, if the teacher's actions were clearly within his usual humor and the friend overreacted, the author's decision might be seen as understandable. \n\nBut the friend reported it, which led to a suspension. The school might take such reports seriously, regardless of intent. The author is ending a new friendship over this, which could be seen as cutting ties without considering the friend's possible trauma or the school's policies. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they ended the friendship without knowing the friend's full story. It's possible the friend had a valid reason, and the author acted impulsively. But it's also possible the teacher's remark was a clear line crossed. However, the key here is the friend's reaction caused a month-long suspension of a teacher who was popular and not in the wrong. The author might be punishing the friend for the consequences of her actions, even if the friend's actions were justified. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they ended the friendship without understanding the friend's perspective and the teacher's suspension might have been a result of a complex situation. The author might not have had enough information to judge.\n"
