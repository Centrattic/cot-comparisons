He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher in question, T, is described as someone who makes dark jokes and shows R-rated movies. He's popular with students. The friend in question is someone the user hasn't known long\u2014started talking in the second quarter of junior year. The friend is portrayed as easily offended. The teacher said something like, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" as a joke, which the friend took seriously, ran out, and the principal got involved, leading to the teacher's suspension.\n\nThe user is upset because they liked the teacher's class, found it fun and easy. Now they're angry at the friend and have ended the friendship. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the friend might have felt genuinely hurt or threatened by the teacher's comment. Threatening suicide is a serious matter, even if it's a joke. If someone says something like that, even in jest, it's not okay. The friend's reaction could be justified if they felt the teacher was being harmful. So maybe the friend had a valid reason to report it, especially if the teacher's comment crossed a line into something inappropriate or hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher has a history of making dark jokes and being unconventional. The user might be defending the teacher because they enjoyed the class atmosphere. But ending a friendship over this might be a harsh reaction. The user didn't take the time to understand the friend's perspective, maybe. The friend's mental health history isn't known to the user. If the friend has a history of being vulnerable, that context is missing here. The user's friend could have had a legitimate reason to feel unsafe or targeted.\n\nBut the user didn't consider that. They just ended the friendship because they were angry about losing the teacher. That seems self-centered. The user's anger might be misplaced. The friend's actions, while leading to the suspension, might be a response to something that was actually inappropriate. The user is cutting off the friend without knowing the full story, which makes them the antagonist here. The user didn't try to communicate with the friend to understand their side before ending the friendship. That's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that the friend is now disliked by others, but that doesn't justify their actions. Everyone makes decisions based on their own values. The user could have been more empathetic. Even if the teacher was a good teacher, the friend's reaction might have been a response to something that was indeed harmful. The user is prioritizing their own feelings over their friend's actions, which might not be fair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is in the wrong because they ended the friendship without understanding the context, possibly dismissing the friend's valid concerns. The friend might have overreacted, but the user's response was too extreme. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
