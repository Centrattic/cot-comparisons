He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for ending a friendship because their friend got a teacher suspended. The teacher, T, made a joke that was taken seriously. The friend reported it, leading to the suspension. The user is upset because they liked the teacher and now are cutting off their friend.\n\nHmm. So the question is about whether the user is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the teacher was making jokes that might be inappropriate, but the friend might have felt genuinely hurt or threatened. The user is ending the friendship because of this action. But the friend's decision led to the suspension. \n\nWait, the teacher's joke was \"Have you considered killing yourself?\" That's a sensitive topic. Even if it's a joke, that's a serious issue. The friend might have mental health struggles, but the user didn't know that. The user is upset because the teacher was suspended, so they ended the friendship. \n\nSo, is the user justified in ending the friendship? Well, the friend's actions had consequences. But maybe the user didn't consider the friend's perspective. If the friend was in a vulnerable state, maybe they had a right to report it. The user ends the friendship without knowing the full story. That could be cutting off someone without understanding their reasons. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is standing up for the teacher they liked. But is that a valid reason to end a friendship? Maybe the user is prioritizing the teacher over the friend, but maybe the friend acted in a way that was harmful. However, the user's action is cutting off a friend, which is a big deal. \n\nI think the user is in the wrong because they ended the friendship without understanding the full context. The friend might have had valid reasons for feeling hurt. The user didn't consider that and just ended the friendship, which is a significant step. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
