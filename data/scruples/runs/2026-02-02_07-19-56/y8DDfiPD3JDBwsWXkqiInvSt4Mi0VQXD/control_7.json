He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and showed R-rated movies, which students liked. The friend, who gets easily offended, took offense to a joke the teacher made about suicide. The joke was clearly meant in a humorous way, but the friend reported it, leading to the teacher's suspension.\n\nThe author is upset because they enjoyed the teacher's class and think the friend overreacted. They ended the friendship because of this. Now, the question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher's behavior might have been inappropriate, especially with the suicide joke. Even if it was a joke, making such a comment could be harmful, especially to someone with mental health issues. The friend might have valid reasons to be upset, especially if they're in a vulnerable state. However, the author is frustrated because the teacher was popular and the friend's action led to suspension, which disrupted the class.\n\nBut the author ended the friendship without knowing the friend's background. Maybe the friend has a history of mental health struggles that the author isn't aware of. The friend could have been genuinely hurt and felt that the joke was crossing a line. On the other hand, the author might feel that the friend didn't consider the teacher's intent and overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are the teacher's intent vs. impact, the friend's possible mental health, and the author's decision to end the friendship without full context. The author is making a judgment based on their own perspective without considering the friend's possible reasons. Ending a friendship over this might be hasty if the friend had valid concerns. However, the teacher's suspension affected others, like the author, who enjoyed the class.\n\nBut the author is also acting on their own frustration without understanding the friend's situation. It's possible that the friend did the right thing by reporting the comment, even if it was a joke. The author's main issue is valuing the teacher's humor over the friend's well-being. However, the friend's action had consequences, and the author is now distancing themselves because of that.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong for ending the friendship if they felt the friend overreacted, but they might also be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective. The teacher's suspension could be a result of the friend standing up for herself, which might be a valid action if the joke was harmful. The author's reaction seems harsh, especially without knowing the friend's background. So, perhaps the author is at fault for cutting off the friend without trying to understand their side or the teacher's actual behavior's impact.\n"
