He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe teacher, T, was known for dark humor and inappropriate jokes, which the students generally found funny. The friend in question is someone who gets offended easily. The incident happened when T made a joke asking the friend if she had considered killing herself. The teacher wasn't being serious, but the friend took it the wrong way and reported him, leading to his suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and now are cutting off their friend. \n\nFirst, I should consider the friend's actions. If the joke was genuinely hurtful to her, even if it was meant as a joke, she might have felt threatened or disrespected. Mental health is important here. If the friend has a history of being sensitive or mental health issues, her reaction could be more understandable. However, the author doesn't know her history, which complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher was known for making dark jokes, so maybe the students were used to that. The friend's decision to involve the principal and her mother might have been an overreaction, especially if the teacher had a pattern of such behavior. But if the joke was particularly cruel or crossed a line, even if it was a joke, the friend might have felt it was necessary to take action.\n\nThe author ends the friendship because they support the teacher and are angry at the friend for causing his suspension. But is it fair to end the friendship just because they disagree with the friend's actions? The author might be prioritizing the teacher's job over their friend's well-being. However, the friend's actions did lead to the suspension, which could be seen as unfair to the teacher if the joke wasn't malicious.\n\nThe key points are: the teacher's pattern of behavior, the nature of the joke, the friend's sensitivity, and the consequences. The author is upset because they liked the teacher, but the friend might have felt she had no choice. Without knowing the friend's mental state or the context of the joke, it's hard to say. The author might be in the wrong for cutting off a friend without fully understanding her perspective. Alternatively, the friend might be at fault for overreacting. But the author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as harsh if the friend was acting in self-defense, even if it led to the teacher's suspension.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the author is the one making a judgment call here. If the friend's actions were justified, the author is wrong to cut her off. If the friend overreacted, maybe the author is in the right. But without knowing the full context of the joke and the friend's history, it's hard. However, the friend did take the issue to the principal, which might be appropriate if she felt uncomfortable. The author's anger might stem from loyalty to the teacher rather than considering their friend's experience. So, the author could be in the wrong for not understanding their friend's perspective and cutting her off.\n"
