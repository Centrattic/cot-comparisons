He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: their friend reported the teacher for a joke that led to the teacher's suspension. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and showing R-rated movies. The friend in question is the one who took offense and caused the suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and thought the friend overreacted.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was right to end the friendship. The teacher's comment, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" was a joke, but it's a sensitive topic. Even if it's meant in jest, making such a comment could be hurtful. The friend took it seriously and reported it, leading to the suspension.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher's behavior might have been inappropriate. Making jokes about self-harm in a classroom setting could be problematic, especially if a student takes it the wrong way. The friend might have felt threatened or upset, and reporting it could be a way to address that. However, the teacher's intent was a joke, and the context matters\u2014since he's known for making dark humor, maybe the student was overly sensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author ended the friendship because they were upset about the teacher's suspension. They might feel that the friend overstepped by getting the teacher suspended for a joke. But is it fair to end a friendship over that? Friendships require mutual respect. If the friend acted in bad faith or without considering the teacher's intent, maybe the author's reaction is harsh. However, if the teacher's comment was indeed inappropriate, the friend might have been justified in reporting it.\n\nThe author doesn't know the friend's history with mental health issues. The friend might have a history where such comments are more hurtful. Without that context, it's hard to judge. The author made an assumption that the joke was harmless, leading them to be upset with the friend. But the friend's action led to the teacher's suspension, which the author dislikes.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: the friend might have overreacted if the teacher's intent was a joke, but the teacher's behavior could have been unprofessional. The author ending the friendship because they disagree with the friend's action might be hasty. Ending a friendship is a big step, and it's important to consider if the friend's actions were reckless or if they had valid reasons. Since the author doesn't know the friend's background, they might not have the full picture. The author could be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without understanding their perspective or the potential consequences of the teacher's actions.\n"
