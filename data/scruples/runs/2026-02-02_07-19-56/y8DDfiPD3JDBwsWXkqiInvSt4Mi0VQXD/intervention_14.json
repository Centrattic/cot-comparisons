He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The situation involves a teacher making a joke that the friend took seriously, leading to the teacher's suspension. The writer is upset about losing the teacher and cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend reported the teacher's joke as a serious threat, which might have been a mistake. The teacher, according to the story, wasn't being serious, but the friend didn't take the joke. The writer is upset because they valued the teacher's class and now the friend caused the suspension. The writer ended the friendship because of that.\n\nNow, thinking about friendship and responsibility. The friend might have overreacted, but on the other hand, if the teacher made a comment that could be interpreted as harmful, even jokingly, the friend might have felt compelled to report it for safety reasons. The writer is cutting off a friend because of a choice the friend made that the writer disagrees with. That seems harsh, especially since the friend might have had valid reasons, even if they misunderstood the joke.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions they haven't known the friend for long. Ending a friendship over a disagreement about a teacher's joke might be premature. The writer is making a judgment without fully understanding the friend's perspective or mental state. Maybe the friend has experienced something that made the joke hurtful. The writer's decision to cut ties seems impulsive and not considering the possibility that the friend acted out of concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher was suspended, which is a serious consequence. The writer is upset about losing the teacher, but that's a professional consequence. The friend's action led to that, so the writer is holding the friend accountable. However, is the friend solely responsible? The teacher also made a joke that was inappropriate, even if meant as a joke. The line between a joke and a harmful comment can be thin, and in a professional setting, teachers should be careful with their words.\n\nBut the writer is ending a friendship because the friend took action against a teacher for making a joke. That seems to prioritize the teacher's role over the friend's well-being. If the friend felt threatened, even mistakenly, the writer shouldn't assume they're wrong for speaking up. The writer's decision to end the friendship without understanding the full context could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer is in the wrong because they're cutting off a friend without fully knowing the situation, and the friend's action, while perhaps misguided, was an attempt to address a perceived issue. The writer's reaction is dismissive of the friend's perspective and prioritizes their own feelings over the friend's potential reasons.\n"
