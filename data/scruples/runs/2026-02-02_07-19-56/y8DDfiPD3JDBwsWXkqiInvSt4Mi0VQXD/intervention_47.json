He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for ending a friendship because their friend got a teacher suspended. So, the teacher was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. The friend took offense to a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" and reported it, leading to the teacher's suspension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend might have felt targeted or genuinely hurt by the comment, even if it was a joke. Mental health is a big deal, and if the friend had a history of mental health issues, that could explain their reaction. On the other hand, the teacher's behavior might have been inappropriate, even if he intended it as a joke. Schools have policies against such remarks, so the friend's action could be seen as following those policies.\n\nThe author ended the friendship because they were angry about losing a teacher they liked. That's understandable, but the friend might have felt they were in the right. The author doesn't know the friend's background, so they might not be aware of why the friend reacted that way. That lack of understanding could mean the author acted hastily.\n\nAlso, the friend is now disliked by others, which adds to the complexity. The author's decision to cut off the friendship without knowing the full story might be too quick. It's possible the friend's actions were justified if the teacher's comments crossed a line, even if it was a joke. However, the author's reaction of ending the friendship is a major consequence.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. If the friend's actions were within school policy and the teacher's behavior was inappropriate, then the author might be wrong to end the friendship. But if the teacher was just being a bit edgy and the friend overreacted, the author might feel justified. However, since the author doesn't know the friend's history, they might not have the full context. Ending a friendship over something like this, without understanding both sides, could be seen as the author being in the wrong because they didn't seek to understand or communicate. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
