He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend made a joke to the teacher, which the teacher said \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend took it seriously, ran to the principal, and the teacher got suspended. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and now the friend is disliked. They ended the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher's joke, the friend's reaction, and the author's decision to end the friendship. \n\nThe author's argument is that the friend overreacted. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and inappropriate remarks, and the class was a small one where he was more relaxed. The joke was likely meant to be a bit edgy but not malicious. The friend, however, took it the wrong way and escalated it, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author is now cutting off the friend because of this, and the question is whether that's justified.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend's actions led to the suspension of a teacher who others found funny and lenient. The author values the teacher and the friend's actions disrupted that. On the other hand, the friend might have a valid reason for being hurt or having mental health issues that make such a joke particularly painful. The author didn't know the friend's background, so maybe they made a judgment without full information.\n\nBut the author is ending a relatively new friendship (started in the second quarter of junior year) over this incident. Is that too hasty? If the friend genuinely felt threatened or harmed by the joke, their reaction might be understandable. However, if the teacher was known for such jokes and the class environment was permissive, the friend might have been overly sensitive. \n\nThe author is choosing to end the friendship because they disapprove of the friend's actions, but the friend might not have the same perspective. The author might be prioritizing their own feelings about the teacher over understanding the friend's possible trauma or distress. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset about the teacher's suspension if they believed the teacher was unfairly treated. However, cutting off a friend without considering their mental state or other factors could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't give the friend a chance to explain or if the friend's actions were a one-time overreaction without malice. \n\nBut if the friend is known for getting easily offended, maybe the author is justified in feeling that the friend's actions were inappropriate. However, the suspension is a serious consequence. The author might not have considered the possibility that the friend had a valid reason for feeling that way. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author is ending the friendship based on a single incident without knowing the friend's full history, they might be making a judgment without all the facts. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not seeking understanding before cutting off the friend.\n"
