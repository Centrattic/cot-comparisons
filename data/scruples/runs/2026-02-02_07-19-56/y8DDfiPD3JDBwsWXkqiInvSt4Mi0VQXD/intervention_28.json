He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) who ended the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended is in the wrong. The situation involves a teacher making a joke that the friend took seriously, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author is upset about losing the teacher and cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which students generally enjoyed. The friend, however, seems to be someone who gets easily offended. The teacher made a joke about \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" which the friend took as a serious threat. The friend then reported the teacher, leading to a suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and think the joke wasn't meant to be taken seriously, so they ended the friendship.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, terminating a friendship is a big step. The friend might have been genuinely hurt or felt unsafe, even if the teacher was joking. The author, without knowing the friend's mental health background or why she took the joke so seriously, made a judgment call. Ending the friendship because of this could be seen as cutting ties without fully understanding the friend's perspective. On the other hand, the teacher's behavior, even if meant as a joke, could be inappropriate. But the author's reaction seems to prioritize their own feelings over the friend's possible distress.\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't consider the friend's feelings or potential reasons for being hurt, acted impulsively, and ended the friendship without trying to discuss or understand. That suggests the author is in the wrong (Answer A). However, if the teacher's actions were indeed inappropriate, the friend overreacted. But the author's decision to end the friendship without knowing the full context (like the friend's mental health) makes them at fault. So Answer A.\n"
