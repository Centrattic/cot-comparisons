He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a friend got a teacher suspended for a month by reporting him after he made a joke. The author liked the teacher and ended the friendship because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which some might find inappropriate, but he was well-liked. The friend in question is described as someone who gets easily offended. The incident happened when the teacher made a joke about suicide, which the friend took seriously and reported, leading to the teacher's suspension.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the teacher was a good, funny person who was doing his job with some humor, and the friend overreacted. The author ended the friendship because of this, which is a big step. But maybe they felt the friend was being overly sensitive, especially since the teacher wasn't being serious. However, the friend's action had real consequences\u2014losing the teacher's job for a month. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's response might be based on her own sensitivities or past experiences. The author admits they don't know the friend's mental health history. If the teacher's joke was genuinely hurtful, even if intended as a joke, it could be problematic. The friend might have felt threatened or triggered, and reporting it could be her way of seeking help or protection. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The teacher meant it as a joke, but the impact on the friend was significant enough to report. The author is upset that the friendship ended because they valued the teacher, but they didn't consider the friend's perspective enough. Ending a friendship over someone seeking help, even if the situation is complex, might be cutting them off without understanding their motivations. \n\nAlso, the author is quick to judge the friend's reaction without knowing her background. The friend's actions might have been valid for her own well-being. The author's response was to end the friendship, which is a harsh reaction. They could have talked to the friend to understand her side before cutting ties. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides might have some accountability. The teacher should avoid making jokes that could be hurtful, and the friend might have overreacted. But the author's decision to end the friendship without fully understanding the friend's reasons could be the main issue here. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not seeking to understand and for ending the friendship so abruptly.\n"
