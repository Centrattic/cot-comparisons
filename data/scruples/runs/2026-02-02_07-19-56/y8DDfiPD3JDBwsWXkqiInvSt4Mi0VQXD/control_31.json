He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The situation involves a teacher who made a joke that the friend took seriously and reported, leading to the teacher's suspension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and showing R-rated movies, which the students generally liked. The friend is described as someone who gets easily offended. The teacher said \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" as a joke, which the friend took as a serious threat. The friend and her mother reported this, leading to the suspension. The author then ended the friendship, feeling that the friend overreacted.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The teacher's actions could be problematic. Even if it was a joke, saying something like that, especially if the teacher knows the student has a history of mental health issues, could be seen as crossing a line. However, the friend's reaction might have been an overreaction if the teacher intended it as a joke and there was no prior context of the friend being vulnerable.\n\nBut the user is the one who ended the friendship. The question is whether they're wrong for doing so. The teacher's suspension was a result of the friend's actions. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and felt the friend was at fault. However, the friend might have felt targeted or unsafe, leading her to report the incident. The author didn't know the friend's history, so maybe they didn't consider her perspective. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for their favorite teacher. On the other hand, ending a friendship because someone reported a teacher's potentially harmful behavior might be harsh. The friend might have acted out of fear or past trauma, which the author wasn't aware of. The author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely felt the friend overreacted, but if the teacher's joke was inappropriate regardless of intent, the friend's action could be justified. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut in terms of social expectations, maintaining a friendship over such a serious issue might be difficult. The author's decision could be seen as valid if they believe the friend's action was disproportionate. However, they might not be in the wrong for ending the friendship but also need to consider the friend's perspective. The answer would depend on whether the teacher's comment was a clear violation or a misunderstood joke. If it's the latter, the author might be in the right to end the friendship. But if the teacher's behavior was indeed inappropriate, then the friend's action is justified, and the author is wrong to cut ties.\n"
