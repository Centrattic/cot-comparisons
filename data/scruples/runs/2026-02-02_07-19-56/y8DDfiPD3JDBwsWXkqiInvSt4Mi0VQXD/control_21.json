He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (TA) is in the wrong for ending the friendship with their friend because she got a teacher suspended. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. The friend in question got offended by a joke where T said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The teacher wasn't being serious, but the friend took it seriously and reported him, leading to his suspension.\n\nThe author is upset because they liked the teacher for being funny and lenient, and now they're mad at the friend for causing this. They ended the friendship over it. The question is whether the author was wrong to do so.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher's joke could be seen as inappropriate, especially if it was taken out of context. Even if he meant it as a joke, saying something like that to a student is potentially harmful and could be a serious issue. The friend might have felt targeted or unsafe, which is a valid reason to report it. The school's response to suspend the teacher might be necessary to address the behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend might have overreacted. If the teacher had a history of making jokes like that and the students were used to it, the friend's reaction seems disproportionate. The friend's actions led to a suspension, which had a significant impact on the teacher and the students who liked him.\n\nThe author ends the friendship because they feel the friend unnecessarily caused harm to someone they both liked. But is it fair to cut off the friend entirely? The author doesn't know the friend's mental state or past experiences that might make them more sensitive. However, the author is choosing to side with the teacher, who may have crossed a line, over their friend.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the teacher's joke was inappropriate, but the friend's response might have been the only way to address it. The author's anger at the friend for taking a stand could be misplaced. The author's action of cutting off the friendship seems harsh, especially without understanding the full context of the friend's perspective. So, the author might be in the wrong for ending the friendship over this, as they're prioritizing the teacher's well-being over their friend's, without considering the potential seriousness of the teacher's behavior.\n"
