He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The author's friend made a joke that led to the teacher being suspended, and the author ended the friendship because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. The friend, who the author only started talking to in the second quarter of junior year, got offended by a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend ran to the principal, and the teacher was suspended for a month. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and ended the friendship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The teacher's behavior could be questionable. Jokes about sensitive topics like suicide, even if meant as a joke, can be harmful. If the teacher made such a comment in a classroom setting, that's a serious issue. However, the friend's reaction led to the teacher being suspended. The author is upset because they valued the teacher's class and think the friend overreacted.\n\nBut the author ended the friendship based on their own judgment without knowing the friend's background. The friend might have a valid reason for being sensitive, maybe mental health issues or past trauma. The author didn't consider that and cut ties without understanding. The question is whether ending the friendship was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher's joke was inappropriate and could cross a line, even if meant as a joke. On the other hand, the friend's action led to the suspension, which disrupted the class and the teacher's job. The author is upset about the loss of the teacher but doesn't know the friend's history.\n\nSo, the author's decision to end the friendship might be hasty. They didn't take the time to understand the friend's perspective or the teacher's actions fully. Ending a friendship over this without knowing all the facts could be seen as the author's fault. They prioritized their own feelings over the friend's potential reasons, which might not be fair.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's possible valid reasons and ended the friendship based on incomplete information.\n"
