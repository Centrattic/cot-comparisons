He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the friend got a teacher suspended by reporting a joke the teacher made. The author ends the friendship because of that. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The teacher, T, is known for making dark or inappropriate jokes and even showed R-rated movies. The friend in question was someone who got easily offended. The teacher made a joke asking if she considered killing herself, which she took seriously and reported. The mother supported her, leading to the suspension. The author is upset because he liked the teacher and the class became a mess without him. He cut off the friend and is now wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, what are the moral aspects here? On one hand, the teacher's comment was a joke, but making such a serious statement, even as a joke, could be inappropriate. However, the friend took it seriously and reported it, leading to a suspension. The author is upset because the friend caused the teacher to lose his job for a month. But the friend might have felt threatened or genuinely hurt, especially if she's someone who gets easily offended. \n\nThe author's reasoning for ending the friendship is that he valued the teacher's presence and the light-hearted class. However, cutting off a friend because she stood up for herself, even if the situation is complex, might be seen as harsh. The author didn't consider the friend's perspective and didn't try to understand her motivations. Maybe she had a history of mental health issues or trauma that made her react that way. The author made a judgment without knowing her background, which could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher might have crossed a line by making such a joke, even if it was meant to be humorous. But the friend's reaction led to a suspension, which affects the teacher's career. The author is now choosing his loyalty to the teacher over the friend, which could be seen as prioritizing someone's job over a friend's well-being. \n\nSo, the author's action is to end the friendship because he dislikes the outcome (teacher suspended) and blames the friend. But is that justified? It's possible the friend felt she had no choice but to report it, especially if she felt unsafe. The author might not have considered her feelings or the potential seriousness of the teacher's comment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without understanding the full context or her reasons. \n\nAlternatively, if the teacher's comment was clearly a joke and the friend overreacted, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But given that the teacher has a history of making inappropriate jokes and the friend is someone who gets easily offended, the situation is more nuanced. The author didn't take the time to understand her perspective, leading to an abrupt end to the friendship. That seems hasty and possibly unfair. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because he ended the friendship without fully understanding the friend's actions and motivations. He prioritized his own feelings about the teacher over his friend's well-being and the complexity of the situation.\n"
