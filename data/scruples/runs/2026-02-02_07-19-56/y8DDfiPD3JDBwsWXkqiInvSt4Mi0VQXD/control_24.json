He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the teacher in question, T, is described as funny and popular, making dark jokes and even showing R-rated movies. The friend, who the author hasn't known long, got offended by a joke where T asked her if she'd considered killing herself. The friend took it seriously, went to the principal, and with her mom's support, the teacher was suspended. The author is upset about losing the teacher and cut off the friend, leading to the question of whether they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher's actions\u2014was the joke appropriate? The friend's reaction\u2014was it justified? And the author's response\u2014ending the friendship.\n\nFirst, about the teacher. Making jokes, especially dark ones, can be problematic. Even if the teacher intended it as a joke, saying \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" to a student is extremely inappropriate. Suicide is a serious issue, and joking about it, regardless of intent, could be hurtful. Even if the teacher is well-liked, that doesn't excuse crossing professional boundaries. Teachers have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, and such a joke could be seen as crossing that line.\n\nThen there's the friend's reaction. The author mentions that the friend is easily offended. But in this case, the friend took a joke seriously and reported it. If the teacher made that comment in a context where it wasn't clearly a joke, or if the friend felt threatened, her reaction might be understandable. However, if the teacher regularly makes inappropriate jokes and the friend is known to be sensitive, maybe she overreacted. But given that the teacher was suspended, the school administration must have found some validity to the friend's complaint.\n\nNow, the author ended the friendship. They feel the teacher was unfairly suspended and are angry at the friend for causing that. The author's reasoning is that the teacher was joking and that the friend overreacted. However, the author's decision to cut off the friend entirely seems harsh. The friendship was recent, so maybe the author didn't fully understand the friend's perspective or background. The friend might have had good reason to take it seriously, especially if she's dealing with personal issues. The author's response is to end the friendship without considering the friend's mental health or the teacher's professional conduct.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might be in the wrong because they're prioritizing the teacher's behavior over the friend's well-being. If the teacher's joke was indeed a violation of professional standards, then the friend was right to report it. The author's anger at the friend for doing so could indicate a lack of empathy. Ending a friendship over this might be a disproportionate response, especially without trying to understand the friend's side.\n\nBut another angle: if the teacher was known for making inappropriate jokes and the friend's action led to unjust consequences, maybe the author's anger is justified. However, the teacher's suspension suggests that the school took the friend's complaint seriously, which might imply that the teacher's behavior was indeed problematic. In that case, the friend's action was appropriate, and the author's anger at the friend is misplaced.\n\nAlso, considering the author's own class context\u2014AP Human Geography with mostly seniors, where the teacher is more lenient\u2014maybe the teacher's behavior was more relaxed. But even so, making a joke about suicide is crossing a line. The author's defense that the teacher was \"just joking\" might not hold up given the severity of the comment.\n\nIn conclusion, the teacher's behavior was inappropriate, and the friend had a valid reason to report it. The author's decision to end the friendship without understanding the situation fully makes them at fault. They should have communicated with the friend, tried to understand her perspective, and perhaps discussed the teacher's actions more compassionately instead of cutting ties.\n"
