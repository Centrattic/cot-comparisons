He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. So, the situation is that their friend reported the teacher for making a joke about suicide, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author liked the teacher and is upset with the friend for causing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which some might find inappropriate. But he was well-liked and treated his class in a more relaxed way. The friend, who got offended by a joke, reported him, leading to suspension. The author is angry and cut off the friendship.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main points to consider are: the teacher's actions, the friend's reaction, and the author's response.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher made a joke that wasn't appropriate. Even if it's a joke, saying \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" could be hurtful. But the teacher might have thought it was a light-hearted comment, especially if he's known for that kind of humor. However, such a comment can be triggering for someone with mental health issues.\n\nThe friend's action of reporting the teacher led to suspension. If the friend genuinely felt hurt or targeted, maybe she had a valid reason. But if the friend is someone who gets easily offended, maybe she overreacted. The author doesn't know the friend's mental health history, which complicates things.\n\nThe author ended the friendship because of this. Is that wrong? The author's feelings towards the teacher and the situation might be valid. But cutting off a friend over this action might be a harsh reaction. However, if the author feels betrayed or angry, ending the friendship isn't necessarily wrong. Friendships are personal, and people can make choices based on their values.\n\nBut the key here is the teacher's suspension. If the teacher was suspended because of a joke that wasn't meant to be harmful, maybe the friend overreacted. But if the joke was crossing a line, even if it's a joke, then the friend's action could be justified. The author is upset because they liked the teacher, but they're not the one who experienced the joke. The friend's experience might be valid.\n\nHowever, the author ended the friendship without knowing the full context of the friend's mental health. They mention the friend gets offended easily, but that doesn't mean she's wrong in this case. The author's decision to cut off the friend might be seen as prioritizing the teacher over the friend's well-being, which could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not black and white. But considering the friend's action led to someone's suspension, maybe the author is in the wrong for cutting off a friend without understanding both sides. However, the friend's action might be seen as overreaching. The author might feel justified in their anger. But ending a friendship is a big step. It's possible the author didn't overstep by making a judgment based on their limited perspective.\n\nBut the friend's mental health isn't known. If the teacher's joke was genuinely harmful and the friend had a history of needing support, then the friend's action was appropriate. The author didn't know that, though. So maybe the author's decision to end the friendship is a personal choice but not inherently in the wrong. Alternatively, they might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective fully.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction is proportionate. The friend's action caused consequences, but the author's response of ending the friendship might be too harsh. However, if the author felt strongly about defending the teacher, they might not be in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. Given the information, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to prioritize their values and feelings about the teacher. But another angle is that the author is in the wrong for not understanding the friend's actions better. Hmm.\n"
