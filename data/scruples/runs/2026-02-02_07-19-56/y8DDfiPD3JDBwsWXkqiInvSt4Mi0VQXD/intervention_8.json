He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended by reporting a joke the teacher made.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and showing R-rated movies. The friend, who was in another class with T, got offended by a joke where T said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" and reported him, leading to a suspension. The author, who liked T, ended the friendship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The teacher's behavior might have been inappropriate, but he was known for making such jokes. The friend took offense and escalated the situation, resulting in the teacher's suspension. The author is upset because they valued the teacher's class and felt the friend overreacted.\n\nIs the author wrong for cutting off the friend? Well, ending a friendship over this is a personal choice. However, the friend's action had real consequences. If the teacher's joke was genuinely inappropriate or crossed a line, the friend might have a valid reason for reporting it. But if it was just a joke and the friend took it the wrong way, the author might see it as an overreaction.\n\nBut the key points here are the friend's mental state and the context of the teacher's behavior. If the teacher regularly made such jokes, maybe the school should have addressed it before. The friend's action could have been a response to being triggered, which is a valid concern. However, the author is now cutting off the friend without fully understanding the friend's perspective or mental health history, which the author admits they don't know.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might be wrong for ending the friendship without considering the friend's intentions. The friend might have felt that the joke was harmful, especially if they have personal issues with self-harm. The author's reaction could be seen as prioritizing the teacher's job over the friend's well-being. On the other hand, the friend's action led to the suspension of a teacher who many students liked, which could be seen as an overreach.\n\nBalancing both sides, the author's decision is a personal one, but cutting off the friend without understanding the full context might be hasty. The answer hinges on whether the friend's action was justified. If the joke was a serious breach, the friend did the right thing. If it was just a joke, then the friend overreacted. But the author's lack of knowledge about the friend's history makes their decision to end the friendship without trying to understand the friend's side problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not seeking more information and for cutting off the friendship solely based on their own feelings about the teacher.\n"
