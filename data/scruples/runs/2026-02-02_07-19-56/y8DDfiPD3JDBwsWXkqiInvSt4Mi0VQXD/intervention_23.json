He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship because their friend got a teacher suspended. \n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which students liked. The friend, who the author just started talking to in the second quarter of junior year, got offended when the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" as a joke. The friend went to the principal, leading to the teacher's suspension.\n\nThe author is upset because they liked the teacher and think the joke wasn't meant seriously. They ended the friendship over this. The user thinks the author is wrong because maybe the friend was justified if she was being bullied or targeted. But maybe the teacher's behavior was inappropriate, so the friend acted in self-defense. On the other hand, the friend's reaction caused serious consequences for the teacher, possibly over a non-serious joke. \n\nThe key points: The teacher's actions might have crossed a line, even if intended as a joke. The friend might have a history of being sensitive, but we don't know her background. The author ended the friendship because they valued the teacher, while the friend reported the teacher. \n\nIs ending a friendship over this a reasonable response? It's a personal choice, but if the friend's action was overreacting to a joke, maybe the author's reaction is too harsh. However, if the teacher was actually making harmful comments and the friend took action to protect herself, the author might be wrong to end the friendship. \n\nBut the teacher was suspended for a month, which is a serious consequence. The friend's action led to that. If the teacher was in the wrong, the friend is in the right. If the joke was harmless and the friend overreacted, then the friend is in the wrong. The author is ending the friendship because the friend took action that the author disagrees with. \n\nSince the teacher was suspended, maybe there's more to the story. Schools have policies about student safety. If the teacher made a threatening joke, even as a joke, it's a violation. But if it was just a joke and the friend took it seriously, then the friend's reaction might be excessive. \n\nThe author is choosing to end the friendship because they support the teacher and don't want to lose it over what they see as a non-issue. However, the friend might have felt targeted, and the author is cutting ties without understanding the friend's perspective. \n\nSo, depending on whether the teacher was in the wrong or the friend overreacted. If the teacher was in the wrong, the friend is justified, and the author is wrong to end the friendship. If the friend overreacted, the author's choice might be okay. But without knowing the context of the joke and the friend's mental health, it's hard. The author didn't try to understand the friend's side, just cut off. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and the potential seriousness of the teacher's comment.\n"
