He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended for a month. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The teacher, T, was known for making dark and inappropriate jokes, even showed R-rated movies. The friend got offended by a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" and reported it, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author ended the friendship because they thought the friend overreacted and the teacher was innocent. Now, they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's action of cutting off the friendship is justified. From my perspective, the friend's actions might have been a valid response if the teacher's joke was indeed inappropriate or harmful. But the author is upset that the friend caused the suspension, especially since they liked the teacher. The author might not have considered the friend's mental state or past experiences that could make such a joke really hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author had a close friendship and chose to end it without knowing the friend's history. Maybe the friend felt the joke was a serious violation, and the author dismissed their feelings. That's a common issue in friendships when one person's reaction is misunderstood. The teacher's behavior, while tolerated by others, might still be problematic if it crosses boundaries for some students. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's action led to the teacher's suspension, which could be a big deal. The author might feel betrayed because they valued the teacher. But the friend could have been acting on their own valid reasons. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and ending the relationship abruptly. \n\nI think it's important to assess whether the teacher's joke was actually harmful. Saying \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" is a serious thing to say, even as a joke. If the friend felt targeted or if the teacher made other remarks that were part of a pattern, then the friend's reaction might be justified. The author should have tried to understand the friend's side rather than cutting off contact. Ending a friendship over a disagreement about a teacher's conduct without knowing the friend's background seems hasty. The right answer here is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
