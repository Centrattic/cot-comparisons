He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. \n\nFirst, the situation: The teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and even showing R-rated movies. He was well-liked by students. The friend, who is easily offended, took offense to a joke where T said \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend reported him, leading to a suspension. The author, who liked the teacher, ended the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here are the actions of the friend and the teacher. Teachers have boundaries; even in a fun class, making a joke about suicide is crossing a line. It's not just a joke\u2014it's a serious comment that could be seen as harmful or threatening. Even if T meant it as a joke, the context and delivery matter. The friend's reaction led to the teacher being suspended, which could be seen as an overreaction by the friend, but maybe not entirely unreasonable given the nature of the comment.\n\nThe author is upset because they liked the teacher and the friend caused a suspension. But the friend might have felt that the teacher's comment was genuinely harmful. However, the friend's history isn't known\u2014maybe they have mental health issues, which the author didn't consider. The author ended the friendship without understanding the friend's perspective, possibly lacking empathy.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's action led to a teacher losing their job, which could be unfair if the joke was in bad taste but not malicious. On the other hand, if the joke was inappropriate and the friend felt targeted, their reaction could be justified. But the author is ending the friendship over this, which seems harsh. They didn't consider the friend's possible reasons or mental state, just reacted based on their own feelings about the teacher.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without trying to understand their side. It's possible the friend acted wrongly, but the author's immediate end of the friendship without dialogue could be the bigger issue. The question is whether ending a friendship over someone else's actions (even if they're a friend) is justified. Here, the author prioritized their feelings about the teacher over the friendship, which might not be fair, especially without knowing the full context of the friend's actions.\n"
