He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the teacher in question, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. He was popular with students. The friend in question is someone who gets easily offended. The incident happened when the teacher made a joke asking the friend if she had considered killing herself. The friend took it seriously, went to the principal, and the teacher was suspended for a month. The author was upset about this because they liked the teacher, and now they've ended the friendship with the friend. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about the teacher's intent versus the friend's reaction. The teacher was known for making jokes, and the friend took a joke seriously. The friend's mother supported her, leading to the suspension. The author is upset because they valued the teacher's class, while the friend might have been in a vulnerable position. \n\nNow, considering the author's actions, they ended the friendship. The question is whether that's justified. On one hand, the teacher was being inappropriate, even if it was a joke. Making a comment like that, even in jest, can be harmful. The friend might have felt targeted or hurt, especially if she's someone who gets easily offended. On the other hand, the teacher's behavior was part of their teaching style, and the friend's reaction led to professional consequences for the teacher. \n\nThe author is cutting ties because they think the friend overreacted, but maybe they should consider the friend's perspective. If the teacher made a joke that's hurtful, even if not intended, the friend has the right to feel uncomfortable. However, the author might not know the friend's personal history or mental health, which could influence her reaction. \n\nIs it the author's fault for ending the friendship? Well, the friend did take a joke to heart and caused the suspension. But the author is choosing to end the friendship based on that action. The author might be prioritizing the teacher's job over the friend who was the victim here. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because the teacher's comment was inappropriate regardless of intent. The friend acted to address what she found offensive, which led to the suspension. The teacher's behavior could be considered unprofessional, especially if it made a student feel threatened or uncomfortable. The author's anger towards the friend for standing up for herself might be misplaced. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
