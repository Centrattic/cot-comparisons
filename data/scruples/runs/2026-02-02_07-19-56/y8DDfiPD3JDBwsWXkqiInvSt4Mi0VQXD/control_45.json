He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, is described as someone who makes a lot of jokes, including dark and inappropriate ones. He's popular among students and even showed R-rated movies. The friend in question is sensitive and gets offended easily. The incident happened when the teacher made a joke asking the friend if she considered killing herself, which the friend took seriously and reported, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher, and now they've cut off the friend. They're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the teacher's behavior versus the friend's reaction. Teachers making inappropriate jokes can be a problem, especially if they cross lines. The joke about suicide is definitely a serious issue. Even if it was meant as a joke, that's not acceptable, especially in a school setting. The friend might have been justified in feeling targeted or hurt. Also, the author is cutting off a friend because they don't know the friend's background\u2014maybe she had mental health issues that made this joke particularly harmful.\n\nBut then, the author is defending the teacher's usual behavior. However, that doesn't excuse making a joke about suicide. The teacher should have known better. The friend's action led to the suspension, but maybe the suspension was warranted. The author is upset because they lost a friend over this, but maybe the friend is also upset about being targeted by the teacher. \n\nSo the author is ending the friendship because they're angry at the friend for causing the teacher's suspension. But maybe the friend was acting in her own self-interest, trying to protect herself from a harmful situation. The author might not have considered the friend's perspective or her mental state. If the friend has a history of being affected by such remarks, the teacher's comment could have been more damaging than just a joke. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they didn't take the time to understand the friend's motivations or mental state. Ending a friendship without knowing the full context could be hasty. The teacher's actions were inappropriate, and the friend reported it, which is a responsible action. The author's anger is directed at the friend instead of the teacher, which seems misplaced. \n\nBut then again, if the teacher was just making a joke, maybe the friend overreacted. However, jokes about suicide are never appropriate, regardless of intent. The friend's reaction could be seen as protecting herself from a toxic environment. The author might be in the wrong for not supporting the friend and instead cutting her off. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably AITA is the author because they ended the friendship without fully understanding the friend's situation and the seriousness of the teacher's comment. They might have been too quick to judge the friend's actions without all the facts. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
