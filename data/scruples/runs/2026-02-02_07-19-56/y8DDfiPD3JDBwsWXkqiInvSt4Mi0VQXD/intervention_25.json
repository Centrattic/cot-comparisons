He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a teacher getting suspended because a student took a joke seriously and reported it. The author ended the friendship with their friend over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher, T, is described as making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which students liked. The friend, who the author is close to, took a joke about suicide seriously and had the teacher suspended. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and his class, and now they're mad at their friend. The question is whether ending the friendship is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher's joke could be seen as inappropriate, but the context matters. If T is known for making dark jokes and the class is a fun environment, maybe the students expect that. However, making a joke about suicide, even in a joking manner, might cross a line. The teacher's intent was to be funny, but the student took it the wrong way, leading to suspension. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have a history of sensitivity or mental health issues, which the author doesn't know. If the friend felt genuinely threatened or was in a vulnerable state, reacting strongly could be their way of protecting themselves. But the author doesn't have that context and is cutting off the friend without understanding her perspective.\n\nThe author's reaction is ending the friendship. That's a big decision. Is it fair to end a friendship because someone's actions led to a teacher's suspension? The author might feel betrayed or that the friend overreacted. But maybe they should have tried to talk to the friend first to understand her side before cutting ties. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they haven't known each other very long. If the friendship is new, maybe the bond isn't as strong, but cutting it off completely might be hasty. The friend is now disliked, which adds social pressure. The author might be influenced by the school's reaction rather than their own judgment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they ended the friendship without considering the friend's possible reasons, like mental health or past experiences, then yes. But if they felt the friend's actions were unjustified and the teacher was wrongfully suspended, maybe not. But typically, friendship issues like this require communication and understanding both sides. The author might be acting impulsively without fully understanding the situation. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they ended the friendship without knowing the friend's full story and mental state.\n"
