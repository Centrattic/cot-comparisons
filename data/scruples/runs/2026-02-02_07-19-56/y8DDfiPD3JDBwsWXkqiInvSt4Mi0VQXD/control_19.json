He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and inappropriate remarks. He was popular with students. The friend in question is someone who gets easily offended. She reported the teacher after he made a joke asking if she'd considered killing herself. The teacher was suspended, and the author is upset because they liked the teacher, and now they cut off the friendship.\n\nSo, the main points are: the teacher's joke was taken seriously, leading to suspension. The author is angry at the friend for that. Now, the question is whether the author is wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The friend might have felt genuinely hurt or threatened by the joke, even if it was intended as a joke. People with different sensitivities might react differently. The teacher's behavior could be seen as crossing a line, even if it's common for him. On the other hand, the author values the friendship but chose to end it because of this incident. \n\nIs it fair to end a friendship over someone else's actions? The author didn't do anything wrong themselves; they're just upset about the friend's actions. But was the friend in the right? If the friend felt unsafe or targeted, reporting it might be justified. However, the teacher was suspended, so the school took it seriously. \n\nThe author might be prioritizing their preference for a lenient teacher over their friend's well-being. But they didn't know the friend's mental health history. However, the friend is now disliked by others, which complicates things. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be wrong for cutting off the friend without understanding her perspective. The friend could have a valid reason for reporting the teacher if she felt harmed. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissing the friend's feelings. \n\nBut if the teacher's actions were within the bounds of humor and the friend overreacted, then the author's anger is understandable. However, the line between joke and harm can be blurry. Schools have policies against harmful speech, so maybe the friend was right to report it. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong for ending the friendship without fully understanding the context of the friend's actions. It's possible that the friend had a legitimate reason to feel threatened, and the author's response was to cut off the friendship rather than communicate or seek understanding. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
