He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and showed R-rated movies. The friend, who the author is close to, got offended by a joke where T said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend took it seriously, went to the principal, and the teacher was suspended. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and the class was fun. They ended the friendship because of this.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The friend might have overreacted, but if the teacher made a joke about suicide, that's a serious issue. Even if it was meant as a joke, if someone is struggling with mental health, that could be a trigger. The author might not have known the friend's history, so they didn't realize the joke was harmful. However, the author is cutting off a friend without knowing the full context. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher's behavior could be inappropriate regardless of the class being upperclassmen. Making jokes about suicide is a red line. If the teacher did say that, the friend's reaction might be justified if they felt unsafe. The author's anger is directed at the friend, but maybe the real issue is the teacher's actions.\n\nBut the problem here is the author is taking sides without knowing the full story. They didn't talk to their friend to understand her perspective. Ending a friendship over this without understanding if the friend was in a vulnerable situation could be hasty. However, the author might feel that the teacher's suspension was unfair, especially since he was popular and other students didn't object.\n\nI think the key points are: the teacher's joke was inappropriate, the friend took it seriously, leading to suspension. The author didn't consider the friend's possible mental state and reacted by ending the friendship. The author might have acted without knowing the full context. So, the author could be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without understanding her side. But the friend's actions might have been justified if the teacher was indeed making a harmful joke. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't reach out to the friend to discuss it, they might be overreacting. Ending a friendship over someone else's actions without knowing the full story could be seen as unfair. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't give their friend a chance to explain and made a snap judgment. Alternatively, if the teacher's behavior was inappropriate, maybe the author is right to be upset with the friend. This is tricky.\n\nWait, the teacher's joke about suicide is a serious issue. Even if the friend overreacted, the joke itself is problematic. But the friend's reaction led to the suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and cutting her off. But without knowing if the teacher actually said that, the author is making a judgment. The story says the friend ran out, went to the principal, and the mother supported her. So the school took action, which might indicate the school saw it as a serious issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for siding with the teacher without knowing the full story. So answer A.\n"
