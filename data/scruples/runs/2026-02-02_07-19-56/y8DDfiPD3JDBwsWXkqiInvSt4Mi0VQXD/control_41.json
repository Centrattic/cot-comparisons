He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe teacher in question, T, is described as making dark jokes and inappropriate remarks, even showing R-rated movies. The students liked him a lot. The friend in question is someone the author hasn't known for long, started talking in the second quarter of junior year. The friend is said to get offended easily. The teacher made a joke asking the friend if she's ever considered killing herself, which the friend took seriously, ran to the principal, and with her mother's support, led to the teacher's suspension.\n\nThe author is upset because they liked the teacher's class\u2014it was fun, easy, and allowed freedom. The friend is now disliked by the majority of the grade. The author ended the friendship, and the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the teacher made a joke that was inappropriate. Even if it was meant as a joke, saying \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" could be very hurtful, especially if the student is sensitive. However, the teacher's history of making dark jokes suggests that maybe the line between humor and harm was crossed. The friend's reaction led to the suspension. \n\nThe author is mad at the friend for causing the suspension, which affected them negatively because they liked the teacher. But is ending a friendship over this justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that the friend overreacted, especially if the teacher's behavior has been consistently inappropriate. If the teacher was making jokes like that regularly, maybe the friend was just the catalyst for consequences that were long overdue. On the other hand, the teacher's comment could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of the context. The friend might have a history of mental health issues that make such a comment more harmful, but the author doesn't know that. \n\nThe author's main issue is the loss of a teacher they liked and the friend's sudden action causing that. Ending the friendship because of this could be seen as prioritizing the teacher's role over the friend's perspective. However, if the author feels that the friend acted without considering the teacher's intent or the broader context, they might feel wronged. \n\nBut in a healthy friendship, open communication is key. The author might have reacted impulsively without understanding the friend's side. If the friend has a valid reason (like past trauma or mental health struggles), then the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without seeking to understand. However, the author might have their own valid feelings about the teacher's suspension affecting their learning environment.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. The suspension is a serious consequence. If the friend's action led to a teacher losing their job for a month, that's significant. But if the teacher's behavior was already problematic, perhaps the suspension was inevitable, and the friend just pushed the trigger. The author might not be the one to judge the friend without knowing all the details. Ending a friendship over this, though, seems harsh. The author should consider whether their anger is misplaced, especially if the teacher's actions were indeed inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the teacher is at fault for making such a joke. But the friend's reaction led to the suspension. The author is now upset with the friend for that. However, if the author values the friendship, cutting it off without knowing the full story (like the friend's mental health history) might not be the right move. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for ending the friendship without fully understanding the context. They could have tried to talk to the friend first. Alternatively, if the author feels the friend was unnecessarily causing harm to the teacher without just cause, then maybe not. But given the information, the author might be overreacting. So the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they ended the friendship based on incomplete information and a possible lack of communication.\n"
