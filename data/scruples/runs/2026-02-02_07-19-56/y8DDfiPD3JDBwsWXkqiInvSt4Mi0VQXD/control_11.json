He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. The situation involves a teacher who made a joke that the friend took seriously, leading to the teacher's suspension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies, which the students found funny. The friend, who the author describes as easily offended, took a joke as serious and reported it, resulting in the suspension. The author then cut off the friendship because they were upset about the teacher's suspension.\n\nSo, the key points here: the teacher's behavior was a pattern of inappropriate jokes, the friend's reaction was based on taking a joke seriously, and the author ended the friendship because they felt the teacher was unfairly suspended.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. Friendships are personal, and people have different boundaries. However, ending a friendship because someone reported a potentially problematic statement from a teacher might be seen as not taking the friend's perspective into account. The author didn't know the friend's mental health history, which could be a factor in why she reacted that way.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher's suspension might have been an overreaction if it was just a joke. On the other hand, the friend might have had valid reasons, especially if she was in a vulnerable mental state. The author's reaction seems to prioritize the teacher's well-being and the class experience over the friend's actions, without fully understanding the friend's side.\n\nBut the author's decision to end the friendship without knowing the friend's history might be hasty. They didn't attempt to communicate or understand the friend's perspective, which could be a mistake. However, the teacher was suspended for a month, which is a significant consequence. The author's anger towards the friend for causing that might be justified if they felt the friend overreacted, but it's also possible the friend felt threatened and acted in her own self-defense.\n\nThe line between a joke and a harmful comment can be blurry, and schools have policies to protect students. If the teacher made a joke that could be interpreted as threatening, especially to a student who might be sensitive, the school might take it seriously. The author's friend might not have been in the wrong for reporting it, even if the teacher intended it as a joke.\n\nSo, in terms of the friendship, the author is making a judgment without full information. Ending a friendship over this could be seen as cutting off the friend without considering her mental health or the school's response. The author might be in the wrong for not trying to understand the situation more before cutting ties. However, the teacher's suspension is a school decision, and the author's anger towards the friend is personal. It's a complex situation where both sides might have valid points, but the author's decision to end the friendship without knowing the full story could be seen as hasty.\n"
