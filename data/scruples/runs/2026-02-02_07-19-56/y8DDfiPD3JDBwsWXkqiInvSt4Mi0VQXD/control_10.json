He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The teacher, T, is known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. The friend in this case got offended by a joke where T asked her \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend took it seriously, went to the principal, and the teacher was suspended. The author was friends with this person and is now cutting off the friendship because they don't like what happened to the teacher. They felt the teacher was well-liked and just joking around, so they're upset the friend took it that far.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the teacher made a joke that could be seen as inappropriate, even if it was meant as a joke. The friend might have felt targeted or hurt, especially if they have a history of being sensitive or if they're dealing with mental health issues. The friend might have a right to report a teacher who made a comment that could be perceived as harmful, even if the teacher intended it as a joke.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher was known for making these kinds of jokes and the students were used to it. The author is upset that the friend took the joke so seriously and caused the suspension. The teacher's suspension might have been a result of a misunderstanding, and the author feels that the friend overreacted.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author doesn't know the friend's mental state. If the friend has a history of being sensitive or has mental health issues, maybe the teacher should have been more cautious. However, the teacher's comment could be seen as crossing a line, even if it was a joke. Schools have policies against making such comments to students, regardless of intent. The principal might have taken action because the comment could be seen as a safety issue or a violation of school policy.\n\nSo, if the friend reported the teacher because she felt uncomfortable or unsafe, it's a valid action. The author is cutting off a friend without understanding her perspective. The author is assuming the teacher didn't mean harm, but the friend felt targeted. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's feelings and for valuing the teacher's humor over the friend's well-being.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is now disliked by others, which could be a consequence of her reporting the teacher. But the author is choosing to end the friendship because of that, which might be unfair. The friend might have acted out of self-defense or genuine distress, and the author is punishing her for standing up for herself.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they're cutting off the friend without fully understanding her actions and the context. The friend could have valid reasons for reporting the teacher, even if the teacher intended it as a joke. The author's reaction seems to prioritize the teacher's well-being over the friend's, without considering the friend's perspective.\n"
