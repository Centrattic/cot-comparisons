He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and inappropriate remarks. He showed R-rated movies, which might be a bit of a stretch but maybe not illegal. The friend in question gets offended easily. The incident happened when the teacher made a joke asking the friend if she had ever considered killing herself. The teacher wasn't being serious, but the friend took it seriously, ran to the principal, and her mom backed her up, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author ends the friendship because they liked the teacher and think the friend overreacted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that the friend overreacted to a joke. But is that a valid reason to end a friendship? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher made a joke that could be hurtful. Even if it's a joke, saying something like \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" is not appropriate, especially in a classroom setting. It could be seen as harmful, even if the intent was to be funny. The friend might have felt targeted or uncomfortable. The teacher's behavior, while maybe meant as a joke, could be crossing a line. The friend's reaction led to the teacher being suspended, which affects the entire class.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels the teacher was unfairly targeted. The teacher had a reputation for making dark jokes and was well-liked. The friend's action might have been out of character for the teacher's usual behavior. The author is upset because they liked the teacher's class and now have a sub. They end the friendship because they disagree with how the friend handled the situation.\n\nIs ending the friendship justified? The author didn't know the friend's history. Maybe the friend has mental health issues that make such jokes more hurtful. Without knowing that, the author assumes the friend overreacted. But if the teacher said that joke to a student who might be vulnerable, it's a serious issue. The friend might have been protecting herself or others by reporting it.\n\nThe author's decision to cut off the friend could be seen as dismissive of the friend's experience. Even if the author thinks the friend overreacted, the friend's reaction is based on her own perspective. The author's action might not consider the friend's mental state or the potential harm of the teacher's joke. Ending a friendship over a disagreement in judgment, especially without understanding the full context, could be seen as harsh.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and for ending the friendship based on their own values without knowing the friend's full story. The friend's action led to consequences, but the author's response might be too severe. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
