He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and R-rated movies. The friend, who's described as getting easily offended, took offense to a joke where T said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend reported this to the principal, leading to the teacher's suspension. The author is upset because they liked the teacher and now they haven't spoken to the friend in a month. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the teacher's comment: even if it was a joke, saying something like that could be harmful. It's a sensitive topic, and even if not intended, it's a serious issue. The friend might have felt targeted or hurt, which is why she reacted. But then, reporting it to the principal led to suspension. The school probably has policies against such remarks, so maybe the teacher was out of line. \n\nOn the other hand, the author ended the friendship because they were angry at the friend. The friend might have a valid reason for being upset, especially if she has mental health issues or a history of being sensitive. The author doesn't know her background, so maybe they didn't consider her perspective. Ending a friendship over this seems harsh. The author could have tried to understand the friend's side before cutting ties. \n\nBut the friend's action did have consequences. The teacher's suspension affected the class. The author might feel the friend overreacted. However, the key here is whether the friend's action was justified. If the teacher's joke was genuinely hurtful and violated school policies, then the friend's report was appropriate. If the joke was taken out of context, maybe not. The author is in a tough spot, but ending a friendship immediately might not be the right approach. \n\nThe author needs to consider if the friend's action was a mistake or a necessary report. If the friend acted out of fear or hurt, the author should empathize. If the teacher was in the wrong, the friend took the right step. But the author's reaction was to cut off the friend without knowing her history. That seems hasty. The author should probably reflect on their own feelings and try to communicate with the friend instead of just ending things. \n\nSo, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they ended the friendship without understanding the full context of why the friend took that action. They may not have considered the friend's mental state or the appropriateness of the teacher's comments. The author's anger might be misplaced if the friend had a valid reason for reporting the teacher.\n"
