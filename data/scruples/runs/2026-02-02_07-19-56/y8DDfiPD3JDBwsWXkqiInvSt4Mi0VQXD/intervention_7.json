He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. So, I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the teacher, T, was known for making dark jokes and showed R-rated movies. The friend, who the author met recently, took offense to a joke where the teacher said, \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" The friend took it seriously, reported it, and the teacher got suspended for a month. The author is upset because they liked the teacher's class and feel the friend overreacted. They ended the friendship and are now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the teacher's behavior and the friend's reaction. The teacher's jokes were part of his style, but making a comment about suicide, even as a joke, crosses a line. Suicide is a serious topic, and making such a joke can be harmful, especially in a position of authority. The friend might have mental health issues, but that's not specified here. The author doesn't know the friend's background, which is a factor.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's reaction led to the teacher being suspended. The author felt the teacher was unfairly targeted and ended the friendship. But is ending the friendship justified? The author is prioritizing their own feelings about the teacher over the friendship. The friend might be struggling with something, and the author is cutting ties without understanding the full context. The teacher's actions were unprofessional, but the friend's response led to consequences. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They're upset that a friend caused the suspension of someone they liked. But the teacher's behavior was inappropriate, and the friend's reaction, while possibly over the top, might be rooted in real issues. The author is cutting off the friend without knowing their mental health history. That seems unkind. The author could have addressed the situation differently, like talking to the friend first. Ending the friendship because of something done in self-defense, even if misinterpreted, might be harsh. So, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't consider the friend's perspective and ended the relationship abruptly.\n"
