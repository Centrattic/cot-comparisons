He's a hilarious teacher who isn't afraid to make dark jokes, \"inappropriate\" remarks, and even showed a few R-Rated movies near the end of the year. Basically, he was well liked by pretty much all the students at the school.\nNow, my friend. We haven't known each other for too long; we started talking and stuff around the start of the second quarter in junior year (current school year). Now, she's the type to get offended at seemingly unimportant things, remarks, etc. So you see where I'm going with this. (Note - I have T for AP Human Geography, there are only 12 kids in the class and all but one, another friend, are seniors. My other friend, the girl, has him for US History.) Since my class was full of upperclassmen, he treated it more as a fun class, and cracked more jokes and went off topic more than his other classes. \nOne day, I come into T's class greeted by a substitute. Sub explains that he will be covering for the next month, as T is currently suspended. From what I pieced together, what happened was that T was joking around, as usual, and at some point, T said something along the lines of \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" To friend. Of course, he wasn't being serious and obviously meant it as a joke. Friend ran out, went to the principal, and apparently her mother came in and backed her up. One thing led to another, and so T was suspended for a month. I had really liked T and his class; he was hilarious, his class was easy, and he let us do what we wanted. So I got mad at my friend, and we haven't talked for the past month. She is also disliked by the majority of my grade now. I don't know her history - how she is mentally, what her other friends are like, etc. AITA for breaking off our friendship over this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend got a teacher suspended. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nSo, the friend in question, let's call her Friend A, got their mutual teacher, T, suspended. The teacher made a joke saying \"Have you ever considered killing yourself?\" to Friend A. The author, who is the person writing the question, is upset because they liked the teacher and now the friendship is over. They're wondering if they're in the wrong (AITA) for breaking off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The teacher made a joke that was clearly inappropriate, especially with students. Saying something like that, even as a joke, could be very hurtful. Depending on the context, that might be considered a serious issue, especially if the student felt targeted or was affected by it. However, the teacher's intent was to joke, which complicates things. But the line between a joke and harassment can be thin, and if a student feels uncomfortable or threatened, schools often take that seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because they lost their friend over this. They mention that Friend A tends to get offended easily. However, the joke in question is pretty serious. Even if the teacher intended it as a joke, making such a statement to a student could be seen as crossing a line. Schools have policies against verbal abuse or anything that creates a hostile environment, even if it's unintentional.\n\nNow, the author ended the friendship because they were angry. Is that justified? Well, the friend's action led to the teacher being suspended, which affected the author negatively (they liked the class and the teacher). But the friend might have felt that the teacher's behavior was unacceptable, so they took action to protect themselves. The friend might not have a history of being overly sensitive, but the author doesn't know their mental health background.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friendship. Relationships require mutual respect. If the author values the teacher over their friend, especially without understanding the full context of the teacher's comment and the friend's feelings, that could be problematic. However, the friend's action did lead to the suspension, which might have been a harsh outcome. But maybe the friend was acting in self-defense.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The author might feel betrayed because their friend caused the suspension, but the friend might have felt compelled to report it. The author's reaction could be seen as prioritizing the teacher's job over their friend's well-being. But if the teacher was genuinely a good educator and the friend exaggerated, then the author isn't wrong. However, without knowing the full context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe key points are: the teacher made an inappropriate joke, the student reported it leading to suspension, and the author ended the friendship. The author's stance is based on preferring the teacher, while the friend acted on her own experience. The author not knowing the friend's history complicates things, but the friend's action might have been necessary. The author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as dismissive of the friend's experience, which is a problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and the potential seriousness of the teacher's comment.\n"
