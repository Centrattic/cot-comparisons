With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is the asshole for correcting their coworker when he says his son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's son is attending chiropractic school, but the parents refer to it as medical school and even mention their son becoming a doctor at 23. The author corrects this in social situations, which causes some tension with the parents. The author's reasoning is that they should be proud of the actual accomplishment and not inflate it by calling it medical school.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is wrong. The main points to consider are: Is correcting someone's misinformation always necessary? Are the parents misleading others by not specifying the type of school? And is the author overstepping by correcting them in social settings?\n\nChiropractic school is a different field from medical school. Medical doctors (MDs) and chiropractors (DCs) have different educational requirements and credentials. So when the parents say \"medical school,\" that's technically incorrect. The author is pointing out the factual inaccuracy, which could be seen as helpful to prevent others from being misled. However, the parents might be doing this out of pride or perhaps societal perceptions where MDs are more respected. The author's intention is to correct the record, but maybe they're not considering the parents' feelings or their motivations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be right to correct the misinformation because it's important to be accurate, especially when people are making claims that could mislead others. However, the way they're doing it\u2014interjecting in conversations and causing side-eyes\u2014might be seen as confrontational or insensitive. Maybe the author should consider a more tactful approach if they're concerned about the parents' reasons for the misrepresentation.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the parents don't mention chiropractic school in every conversation, implying they're intentionally hiding the truth. The author might be right to challenge that, but doing it in the moment in social settings could be seen as embarrassing the parents. The parents might feel that their child's achievements are being downplayed by focusing on the distinction between MDs and DCs. The author's bias against chiropractic is set aside, but perhaps the parents are proud of their son's accomplishment in their own right, and the author's corrections are making them feel defensive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for correcting the misinformation. If the correction is accurate and the parents are indeed misrepresenting their son's education, the author might be justified. However, if the correction is causing unnecessary tension and the parents have their own reasons for the phrasing (maybe cultural or personal pride), then the author might be overstepping. It's a balance between factual accuracy and social sensitivity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent is to correct misinformation, which is understandable. But the method and context (social situations) might make it inappropriate. They could be seen as the asshole if their corrections are causing harm or discomfort without a clear benefit. Alternatively, if the parents are truly misleading others, the author is right to correct them. The key is whether the correction is constructive or just being done for the sake of being right. Given that the parents react negatively, maybe the author isn't the asshole, but perhaps they should approach it differently. But according to the AITA framework, the answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole because the correction is factual, but there's a nuance here.\n"
