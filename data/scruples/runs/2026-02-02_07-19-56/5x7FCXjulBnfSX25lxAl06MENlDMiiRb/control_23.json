With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the coworker's parents keep saying their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to some negative reactions from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author mentions they have a bias against chiropractic, but they acknowledge the accomplishments of the student. They feel it's important to correct the misinformation because others might wrongly assume the son is in an MD program. The parents, on the other hand, might be trying to present their son's achievements as more prestigious, maybe due to societal perceptions of different healthcare professions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for correcting them. On one hand, spreading misinformation could be seen as misleading people, especially if others don't know the difference between medical school and chiropractic college. The author is being honest about the facts, which could be seen as a positive. On the other hand, the parents might be trying to protect their son's reputation or societal standing, perhaps feeling that chiropractic isn't respected enough. \n\nBut the key here is intent. The author's intent is to correct the record so that people aren't misled. The parents' intent in not disclosing the truth might be to elevate their son's status. However, the author isn't lying; they're just not correcting the parents' statements. If the author is in a position where they can address the misinformation without being confrontational, maybe that's their right. But the way they do it might come off as judgmental, especially if they have a bias against chiropractic. \n\nThe author says they have their own bias aside, but it's possible that their corrections are motivated by that bias, even if they try to be neutral. Also, the fact that they get side-eye from the parents suggests that the parents perceive the corrections as unwelcome. \n\nIn social situations, it's often considered polite to go along with what people say unless it's harmful or offensive. However, in this case, the misinformation could lead others to incorrect assumptions. So the author is trying to prevent that, which is a valid point. However, they might be overstepping by correcting in every situation, especially if the parents don't want to discuss it. \n\nAnother angle is whether the parents are being deceptive. If they're intentionally misrepresenting their son's education, that's a different issue. But maybe they're just not correcting others when people assume it's medical school. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might be causing discomfort for the parents, who might just want to avoid embarrassment or stigma around chiropractic. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author's motivation is to be honest, but their approach might be causing harm to the parents' feelings. It's possible that the author is right about the parents not being proud of chiropractic, but correcting them in social settings could be seen as meddling. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to correct the facts, but their approach could be seen as intrusive. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the parents are the ones misrepresenting their son's education, the author is trying to set the record straight. But social norms might suggest that it's not their place to correct unless it's causing direct harm. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. If the parents are intentionally lying, the author is right to correct. If they're just not correcting others' assumptions, maybe the author is overreacting. But the parents say \"medical school,\" which is a lie. So the author is trying to prevent people from being misled. But maybe the author should approach it more sensitively instead of correcting every time. \n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they're pointing out a misrepresentation. However, the way they do it might be causing friction. But the question is about being an asshole, not about the method. Since the author's intent is to correct misinformation, they're not wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
