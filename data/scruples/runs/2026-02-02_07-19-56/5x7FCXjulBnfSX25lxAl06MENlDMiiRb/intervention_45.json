With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker who says his son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author of the post corrects their coworkers when they make this claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The coworker's parents are presenting their son's education as medical school, which might be misleading since chiropractic and medical schools are different. The author feels they have to correct this, even though it might make the parents uncomfortable. They argue that the parents aren't proud of their son's actual accomplishment, hence the misrepresentation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main question is whether correcting this misstatement is appropriate. On one hand, the author is factually correcting a misunderstanding. On the other hand, the parents might have their reasons for not emphasizing the chiropractic aspect, maybe due to stigma or personal preferences.\n\nThe author mentions their own bias against chiropractors but says they're not dismissing the accomplishment. However, the act of correcting might be seen as undermining the parents' pride, especially if the parents are genuinely proud of their son's achievements in chiropractic, even if they choose to present it differently. \n\nAlso, the parents might feel that the term \"medical school\" is a way to explain their son's education in simpler terms, even if it's not technically accurate. The author's intervention could be seen as exposing their personal biases rather than supporting the parents' right to present their son's achievements as they see fit. \n\nSo, the author's actions are technically correct in terms of factual accuracy, but socially, it might be insensitive. The parents might not want the focus on the type of school, and the author's correction could be perceived as judgmental. Therefore, while the facts are on the author's side, the social aspect might make them the asshole. The answer would be A.\n"
