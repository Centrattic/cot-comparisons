With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he says his son is in \"Medical School,\" when he's actually in Chiropractic school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the coworker's family is presenting the son's education as Medical School, which is different from Chiropractic school. Medical doctors (MDs) and chiropractors (DCs) are distinct professions with different educational requirements and scopes of practice. The family is making it sound like the son is on a path to become an MD, which isn't the case. The author feels that this is misleading and corrects them, leading to some tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing so. The key points here are about honesty, accuracy in public statements, and the family's pride. The author isn't dismissing the son's accomplishment but is pointing out a factual inaccuracy. The family, on the other hand, might be doing this for various reasons\u2014maybe they perceive Chiropractic school as less prestigious, or they're trying to present their son in a better light. However, deliberately misrepresenting the son's education could be seen as dishonest, especially if others are led to believe he's in a more traditional medical program.\n\nThe author's intention is to correct a falsehood, not to belittle the son's achievements. They're advocating for the family to be proud of the actual accomplishment rather than an inflated version. The family's reaction with glares suggests they might be sensitive about how their son's education is perceived, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for pointing out the truth.\n\nIn terms of social norms, correcting someone in a conversation can be seen as rude, but if the correction is about a factual error that affects people's perceptions (like implying someone is in medical school when they're not), it's often considered the right thing to do. The family's actions could be misleading others, which is where the author's concern lies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is trying to maintain honesty and accuracy, which is generally the right approach. The family's misrepresentation might stem from their own biases or desires, but the author isn't in the wrong for addressing that.\n"
