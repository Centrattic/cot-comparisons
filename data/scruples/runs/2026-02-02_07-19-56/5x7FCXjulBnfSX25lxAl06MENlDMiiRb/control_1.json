With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for correcting their coworker and his family when they mention their son is in \"Medical School\" instead of Chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's son is in Chiropractic college, but they present it as Medical School. The author corrects this in social situations, leading to some tension with the parents. The author's reasoning is that they're being honest about the son's actual education and that the parents aren't proud of the real accomplishment, hence their misleading statements.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. On one hand, the parents might be trying to present their son's achievements in a more prestigious light. Chiropractic vs. Medical School might carry different perceptions, and the parents could feel societal pressure or personal pride in having a \"doctor\" in the family. They might not be outright lying but using a term that's technically incorrect but commonly understood as a title (like \"Dr.\" can be used for both MDs and DCs). \n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out the factual inaccuracy. They're not dismissing the accomplishment but are concerned about the parents not being proud of the actual achievement. The author's corrections could be seen as honest and factual, but maybe also as nosy or overstepping if the parents are using a colloquial term without intending deceit.\n\nI should also consider if there's a difference between academic titles and professional titles. For example, both MDs and DCs are doctors, but the education paths differ. The parents might be emphasizing the \"Doctor\" title rather than the specific field. The author is clarifying the actual field, which could be important for accuracy, but if the parents are using a term that's not technically wrong (since their son will be called Dr.), maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nAnother angle: intention. The parents might be inflating the accomplishment due to pride, but the author's intention is to correct misinformation. However, social situations sometimes allow for some embellishment without malice. The author's actions might be causing embarrassment, which could be seen as harsh if the parents aren't being intentionally deceptive.\n\nAlso, the line between correcting and correcting in a way that's socially acceptable matters. If the author is doing it in a condescending or public way, that could make them the asshole. But the story doesn't specify the tone; the author says they're not dismissing the accomplishment. \n\nIn conclusion, the parents might not be in the wrong if their use of \"Medical School\" is a misstatement without deceit, but the author's corrections could be necessary for accuracy. However, the parents' choice to misrepresent could be seen as problematic, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for correcting. But maybe the author is being too direct or causing unnecessary conflict. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong if their intention is to be honest and factual without malice.\n"
