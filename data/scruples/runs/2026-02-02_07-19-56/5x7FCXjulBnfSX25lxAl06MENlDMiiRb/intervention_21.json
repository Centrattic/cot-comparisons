With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for correcting their coworker's parents when they say their son is in medical school instead of chiropractic college. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's son is actually in chiropractic school, but the parents refer to it as medical school and even claim he'll be a doctor at 23. The author feels they need to correct this every time, leading to awkwardness.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that chiropractic school is different from medical school, and by not correcting the parents, they're misleading others. The author believes the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment, hence the need to correct them. The parents, however, might have their own reasons for the misrepresentation\u2014maybe they think chiropractic is less respected, or they're trying to make their son's achievements sound more impressive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Chiropractic care is a legitimate profession, but it's different from MDs. The parents are misrepresenting the field. The author is correcting misinformation. But is it the author's place to do that? \n\nIn social settings, people often inflate their achievements. It's common, so maybe the parents are just doing that. However, the author is actively correcting them, which could be seen as prying or not their business. On the other hand, the author is pointing out factual inaccuracies. The author might be trying to set the record straight for others' benefit.\n\nBut maybe the author is overstepping. The parents might have their reasons for not wanting to disclose the actual school, perhaps due to stigma or personal preference. The author's motivation is to let the parents take pride in their son's real accomplishment. However, the parents are the ones who might feel embarrassed if corrected, leading to tension. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to correct them? If the parents are happy with their son's path, even if it's different from medical school, maybe the author shouldn't interfere. The author might be projecting their own biases (as mentioned in the post) and not considering the parents' perspective. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be right in wanting to prevent others from being misled. But in a social context, correcting someone's parent might not be the best approach. It's possible the author is causing unnecessary conflict by making it a point to correct every time. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author is correcting a factual misstatement, but the parents might have personal reasons for not disclosing the truth. The author's intent is to highlight the real accomplishment, but their method might be causing discomfort. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about intent and impact. The author's intent is to correct misinformation, but maybe the impact is causing embarrassment. The line between being factually accurate and being socially considerate is thin here. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe they are overstepping. However, if the parents are intentionally misleading others, the author is right to correct. But if the parents are just trying to present their son's achievements in a positive light, the author might be causing harm. \n\nGiven that the author mentions their own bias against chiropractic is aside, they are acknowledging that the accomplishment is valid. So the correction isn't about discrediting but clarifying. Still, in social settings, people might not appreciate being corrected on their family's achievements, even if it's a technicality. \n\nSo, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps there's a better way to handle it without confrontation. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because they're prying and causing discomfort. If B (no), because they're correcting a factual error. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're pointing out a fact and not belittling the accomplishment. The parents might be the ones with the issue if they're not proud of their son's actual path. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
