With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting a co-worker who says his son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author feels that the co-worker's family is misrepresenting the son's education and feels compelled to correct them in social situations, which leads to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The co-worker's family is intentionally not mentioning the chiropractic college and instead using \"Medical School,\" which could be misleading since people might think it's an MD program. The author corrects them, which the family reacts negatively to. The author's motivation is to highlight the actual accomplishment rather than the inflated version. \n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From a standpoint of social etiquette, correcting someone in public might be seen as rude. However, the author's intent is to set the record straight about the son's actual education. There's a balance between being honest and respecting others' choices to present their story in a certain way. \n\nThe author isn't dismissing the accomplishment, which shows they aren't belittling chiropractic school. They're concerned about the parents not being proud of the actual achievement. But the parents might have their reasons for presenting it as medical school\u2014maybe they're trying to align with a more prestigious perception or they themselves have biases against chiropractic medicine. \n\nIs it the author's place to correct them? It's a gray area. While honesty is important, the method of correction in social settings might not be the best approach. The author could be well-meaning, but interrupting the parents' narrative might come off as confrontational. However, the parents are actively misrepresenting the information, which could be misleading to others. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the correction is necessary. If the author's goal is to prevent misinformation, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the correction is causing unnecessary conflict without a good reason, they might be. The parents' desire to present their son's education in a certain light is their choice, but the author's correction is based on factual accuracy. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the author's actions are driven by a desire for truth, but the approach might be inappropriate. However, given that the parents are the ones making the misrepresentation, the author could be justified in pointing it out if it's an important distinction. But maybe there's a more tactful way to handle it without public correction. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they are correcting a factual inaccuracy. The parents' actions could be the more questionable ones. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
