With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the coworker's son is in chiropractic college, but they call it \"medical school\" and mention he'll be a doctor at 23. The author corrects them, and the parents react with glares or side-eye. The author feels the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment if they're inflating it like that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Chiropractic school is a real, legitimate program. It's not the same as medical school (MD program), but it's still a significant achievement. The parents might be using the term \"medical school\" because they think it's more respected, perhaps due to societal perceptions. However, technically, chiropractic doctors are called \"Doctor\" too, even though they aren't MDs. So the parents might be conflating the two, which is a bit of a misstatement but not entirely false. \n\nThe author is correcting the parents in social situations. Is that their place? The author isn't a parent or close enough to correct their personal choices in how they present their child's achievements. While the parents are technically misrepresenting the field (chiropractic vs. medical school), maybe the author's motive is to highlight the truth, but the frequency and public nature of the corrections might come off as confrontational or judgmental. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the parents might not be proud of the real accomplishment, implying that their pride is based on an inflated version. That's a bit of an assumption. The parents could still be proud but just use the term that's more socially accepted. It's possible they don't fully understand the difference either, or they think \"doctor\" is a title worth celebrating regardless of the field.\n\nOn one hand, the author is right that there's a difference between medical school (MD/DO) and chiropractic school. On the other hand, calling someone a \"doctor\" for a chiropractic degree is technically correct, even if it's not a medical doctor. The parents might be overselling the accomplishment, but the author's constant corrections could be seen as undermining the parents' right to be proud of their son's path, even if they're using a term that's not 100% accurate.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be well-intentioned, but the way they're doing it\u2014correcting in public, leading to tension\u2014is problematic. The parents are the ones misrepresenting the facts, but the author's response might be overstepping. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for correcting them. Since the parents are the ones being misleading, the author isn't wrong for wanting the truth told, but the method might be inappropriate. However, the question is about being the asshole. If the author's corrections are causing discomfort without a constructive approach, maybe they are partly at fault. But the main issue is the parents' misrepresentation. \n\nHmm. The answer could go either way. But in AITA scenarios, it's often about the tone and context. The author might not be in the wrong for pointing out the truth, but if they're doing it in a way that's making others feel embarrassed, that's an issue. The key is whether the author's correction is necessary and respectful. If they're doing it to \"correct\" the parents' pride, maybe they're projecting their own bias. The original post mentions they set aside their bias against chiropractic, but maybe they still have an underlying bias that's making them overcorrect. \n\nIn the end, the parents are the ones misrepresenting, so the author isn't wrong for wanting to set the record straight, but the way they handle it matters. Since the question is if the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong) because the parents are misrepresenting, and the author is pointing that out. However, if the author is being overly aggressive or condescending, that's a problem. The post doesn't specify the tone, just that the parents react negatively. So maybe the author is in the right to correct the facts, even if their method is abrasive. But in an AITA context, the focus is on the action's justification. The parents are wrong for misrepresenting, so the author isn't the asshole for correcting them. So the answer is B.\n"
