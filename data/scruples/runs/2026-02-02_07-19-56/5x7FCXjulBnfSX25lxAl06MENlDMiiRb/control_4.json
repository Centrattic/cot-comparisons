With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a co-worker's parents who refer to their son attending \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author of the AITA question corrects them, feeling that the parents are inflating their son's accomplishments. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Misrepresenting a Chiropractic program as Medical School is a misrepresentation. Chiropractic programs are different from MD programs; they don't lead to a medical doctorate in the traditional sense. So by saying \"Medical School,\" the parents are likely misleading others. The author is correcting this, which could be seen as right because they're pointing out the truth. However, the way the author does it\u2014interjecting in social situations\u2014might be seen as rude, especially if it leads to negative reactions like side eye.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might not be intentionally lying but just using incorrect terminology. Maybe they don't understand the difference and are proud of their son's achievements in any case. The author's motivation is to correct the misinformation, but is it their place to do so? The author could be overstepping, especially if it's causing discomfort for the parents.\n\nThe key points are the accuracy of the information and the author's intent. If the parents are misrepresenting, the author is justified in correcting. But the method of correction matters. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the correction is necessary and done in a respectful way, maybe not. But if it's done harshly, then maybe A. However, the author doesn't mention being confrontational, just bringing it up in conversation. \n\nAnother angle: The author might be projecting their own bias against chiropractic, even if they say they're setting that aside. They argue that the parents should be proud of the actual accomplishment. The parents' pride is not the issue here; their misrepresentation is. The author's correction is about factual accuracy. So the answer might be B, author is not in the wrong. The parents are the ones misrepresenting, and the author is correcting that. Unless the author is being unnecessarily harsh, but the question doesn't indicate that. So likely B.\n"
