With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the coworker's parents are saying their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author corrects them every time, which leads to some tension. The author's reasoning is that they want to be honest about the son's actual accomplishments and not let the parents misrepresent them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are intentionally misrepresenting their son's education. Medical school is typically for becoming an MD, which is a different path from chiropractic school. Chiropractic care is a different field altogether, though both require education and training. The parents might be doing this for various reasons\u2014maybe societal perceptions of the two professions, or perhaps they feel more proud of MD as a title because it's more common or respected in their circles. However, the author is correcting them in social situations, which could be seen as exposing the parents' embellishments.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for correcting them. On one hand, the author is being honest and pointing out the factual inaccuracy. They might feel it's important to not let the parents mislead others. On the other hand, the parents might feel that the author is being rude or causing embarrassment. Socially, correcting someone in a situation where the family might not want to be corrected could be seen as impolite, especially if the parents are trying to present their son in a certain light. But the author also argues that the parents aren't proud of their son's actual field, which is why they're misrepresenting it.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author mentions they aren't dismissing the accomplishment but want the parents to be proud of the actual achievement. However, by correcting every time, the author might be making the parents feel embarrassed or defensive, which could damage their relationship. The key here is whether the corrections are necessary or if the author should let it go for the sake of social harmony, unless the misinformation is causing harm.\n\nAlso, the parents might have their own reasons for misrepresenting the education. Maybe they're trying to make their son's achievements sound more prestigious, which is a common societal issue. The author's actions could be seen as calling out the parents' insecurities or societal pressures. However, the author's intention is to promote honesty, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut is the author overstepping? In social situations, it's often considered polite to not correct people unless it's important. If the author is doing this in a public setting, it could be seen as causing embarrassment. However, if the author is doing it in a respectful and constructive way, maybe that's different. The problem is the parents' reaction is negative\u2014glaring and side-eye\u2014which suggests they don't appreciate the corrections.\n\nIn terms of the author's right to correct, there's a balance between honesty and tact. The author might believe they're helping the parents by encouraging pride in the real accomplishment, but the parents might see it as an intrusion. It's possible the parents are trying to present their son in a more favorable light, and the author's corrections are disrupting that. \n\nHowever, the author is not in the wrong if they're being truthful and not malicious. The issue is whether the truth should be told in that context. If the author is correcting out of concern for the parents' pride and the son's actual achievements, maybe they're justified. But if it's causing unnecessary conflict without a clear benefit, maybe the author is being overly corrective. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's corrections are constructive and how they're delivered. If they're doing it in a respectful manner, they might not be in the wrong. But if it's causing harm without a clear purpose, maybe they are. However, the story doesn't mention the method of correction. The author's main point is that they feel the parents should be proud of the actual achievement, which is valid. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're advocating for honesty, though they could be more tactful.\n"
