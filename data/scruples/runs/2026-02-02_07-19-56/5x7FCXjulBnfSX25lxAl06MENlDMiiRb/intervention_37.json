With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author works with a coworker whose son is in chiropractic school, but the coworker and their spouse refer to it as \"medical school\" and say the son will be a doctor at 23, which people take to mean an MD. The author corrects them whenever they do this, which leads to negative reactions like glares or side-eye. The author thinks the parents aren't proud of their son's actual achievements because they misrepresent it. The question is whether the author is the asshole (ITA) for correcting them.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author's coworker's son is in a chiropractic program, which is different from medical school. The parents are misrepresenting it as medical school and making claims that others might misunderstand. The author corrects them in social situations, which the parents seem to take badly. The author's intention is to highlight the actual accomplishment and believes the parents shouldn't be proud of the misrepresentation.\n\nNow, considering the possible angles. On one hand, the author is trying to be honest and accurate, pointing out a factual inaccuracy. They mention they have a bias against chiropractic care but still acknowledge the son's hard work. Their motivation is to let others know the truth and to think the parents are not being proud of their son's real achievements. On the other hand, the parents might be trying to present their son's accomplishment in a way that they feel is more impressive, possibly due to societal perceptions or their own biases. The author's corrections might be seen as embarrassing the parents in social settings, which could be hurtful even if well-intentioned.\n\nIs it the author's place to correct them? In social situations, people often exaggerate or use certain terms for effect. Chiropractic doctors do have the title \"Dr.\" so maybe the parents are using that to refer to their son's future status. However, calling it \"medical school\" is factually incorrect. The author might be right in pointing out the factual error, but the way they do it\u2014publicly correcting and maybe causing discomfort\u2014could be problematic. The parents might feel that the author is undermining their pride or embarrassing them, even if the correction is technically accurate.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the author's intent is to help or to correct for their own reasons. The author says they're not dismissing the accomplishment but want the parents to be proud of the real achievement. However, the parents might be proud in their own way, even if they use inaccurate terms. It's possible they don't understand the difference or are using \"medical school\" colloquially. The author's constant corrections might be seen as condescension or not respecting the parents' framing of their son's achievements.\n\nAlso, the term \"practicing doctor at 23\" could be technically true for a chiropractor, as they can start practicing after their program, but medical doctors typically take longer. However, the parents' statement might be misleading if they imply it's an MD. The author is correcting the misinformation, but maybe they should have approached it privately instead of publicly, which could be less confrontational.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a balance between truth and social sensitivity. The author is correct in pointing out a factual inaccuracy, but their method of correction might be inappropriate. The parents might be misinformed or using terms they think are equivalent, and the author's public corrections could be causing more harm than good. The author's actions might be seen as meddling, especially if the parents aren't open to correction. Alternatively, the author is standing up for accuracy, which is important, but perhaps not in the most tactful way.\n\nIn some cases, people do misrepresent facts for social gain, and others feel compelled to correct. The line between being honest and being an asshole can be thin. The author's intention is to highlight the truth, but the parents' reaction suggests they feel disrespected. The author might be overstepping by constantly correcting in social settings, especially if it leads to conflict. However, if the parents are intentionally misleading people, the author has a point in wanting to correct that.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the correction is necessary and how it's delivered. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to correct misinformation, but the approach could be questioned. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the context, the author's actions might be seen as justified in maintaining accuracy, but the parents' reactions indicate that the method is causing discomfort. However, the parents are the ones misrepresenting facts. So perhaps the author is not in the wrong because the truth is on their side, even if the delivery could be improved.\n"
