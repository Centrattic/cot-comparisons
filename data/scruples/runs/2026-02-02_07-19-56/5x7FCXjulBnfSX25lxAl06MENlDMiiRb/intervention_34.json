With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when they refer to their son's chiropractic college as \"medical school.\" The coworker and their spouse are presenting the son as going to medical school and even saying he'll be a doctor at 23, which leads others to assume an MD. The author steps in to clarify the actual program, which causes some backlash from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coworker's parents are misrepresenting their son's education. Chiropractic school is different from medical school, and the title \"Doctor\" can be confusing. Chiropractors do earn a doctoral degree, but it's a DC (Doctor of Chiropractic), not an MD. So technically, they're not lying if they say he's a doctor, but they are misrepresenting the type of school and the nature of the degree.\n\nThe author's intention is to correct the misinformation, which might be seen as helping others avoid the misconception. However, the parents might feel that the author is undermining their pride or being judgmental about their son's choice. The author mentions they aren't dismissing the accomplishment, so their correction isn't about the value of the degree but the accuracy of the information.\n\nIs it the author's place to correct every time? It depends on the context. If the author is in a social setting where such misinformation could lead to misunderstandings (like professional settings or when others make incorrect assumptions), then correcting might be appropriate. However, if the parents are using this as a way to gain social status or pride, the author might be overstepping by repeatedly bringing it up, especially if it's causing discomfort.\n\nBut then again, the parents are intentionally omitting the truth, which could be seen as misleading. The author's correction is factual. The problem is whether the author is being a jerk by doing so. If the author is doing it out of a sense of honesty and not to belittle, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if they are doing it in a condescending way, that's different.\n\nAnother angle: the parents might feel that the author is judging their son's career choice. Even if the author isn't, the parents' reaction (glaring, side-eye) suggests that they perceive it that way. Is the author right to correct, even if it causes tension? Maybe they should have a private conversation first instead of correcting in public. However, the author might not want to avoid public corrections if they believe the misinformation is harmful.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are about correcting a factual inaccuracy, but the method and frequency might be causing issues. However, the parents are the ones misrepresenting the facts. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author is being respectful and not condescending, then maybe they're not. But if they're doing it to mock or belittle, then yes. The original post says the author is not dismissing the accomplishment, so their intent is good. So maybe they're not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
