With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's coworker's son is in chiropractic college, but the parents say he's in medical school. The author corrects them every time, which leads to some social tension. The author believes the parents aren't proud of their son's actual achievement and are inflating it. \n\nFirst, I should consider the difference between medical school (MD) and chiropractic school (DC). Chiropractic care is a different field, and while it's a legitimate profession, it's not the same as becoming a medical doctor. The parents are misrepresenting their son's education, which could be misleading to others.\n\nNow, the author is correcting them in social situations. Is that appropriate? Well, if people are being deceptive, maybe others should point it out. But sometimes, people might overstate things for social reasons, even if it's not entirely accurate. The author's intention is to acknowledge the real accomplishment, but the parents might feel embarrassed or want to present their son's achievements in a better light.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. They mention they don't have a bias against chiropractic care and acknowledge the effort required. So their correction isn't out of negativity but to avoid misrepresentation. However, correcting someone in a social setting can be seen as confrontational, even if well-intentioned. The parents might not want to be corrected, especially if they're proud of their son's path, even if it's different from traditional medicine.\n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? Maybe in some communities, certain professions are more valued, so parents might inflate the status. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the parents' pride, even if the facts aren't correct. Or maybe the author is right to promote honesty.\n\nAlso, the parents' actions: saying their son is in medical school when he's not. That's a misrepresentation. The author is pointing out the truth. But is it the author's place to do so in every social interaction? Maybe there's a way to correct without confrontation, like after the fact or in private.\n\nThe author's justification is that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment if they misrepresent it. But maybe they are proud but feel societal pressure to present it differently. The author's correction could be seen as necessary to prevent others from being misled.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If someone is deliberately misleading others, the author has a right to correct them. But the method might be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their method is optimal. Since the parents are misrepresenting, and the author is correcting facts, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But others might argue that people have the right to present their achievements as they wish, even if it's not entirely accurate. \n\nHmm. I think the key is intent. If the author is correcting for accuracy, they're not wrong. But social dynamics might make it awkward. However, the parents are being deceptive, so the author isn't the asshole for pointing that out. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
