With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is correcting their coworker when he says his son is in \"Medical School,\" but the son is actually in Chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker and his wife consistently refer to the son as being in Medical School and mention he'll be a doctor at 23, which leads people to think he's in an MD program. The author corrects them, leading to some negative reactions like glares. The author argues that the parents should be proud of the actual accomplishment and not inflate it, implying the parents aren't proud of chiropractic school because they don't mention it.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author's intention is to be honest and correct the misinformation. However, the parents are the ones making the false claims. The author is pointing out the truth, which could be seen as right, but maybe the way they do it is causing discomfort. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are misrepresenting their son's education. The author is correcting that, which is factual. However, social dynamics might mean that the author is prying or being unsympathetic. The parents might have their reasons for not disclosing the field, maybe due to their own biases or societal perceptions. \n\nBut the author is not the one spreading the misinformation. They're pointing out the truth. However, in social situations, sometimes people prefer to not correct others to avoid embarrassment or conflict. The author might be overstepping by making it a point to correct every time, especially if it's causing discomfort for the parents. \n\nSo, the parents are in the wrong for misrepresenting their son's achievements, but the author's actions could be seen as necessary or unnecessary. If the author is being tactful, maybe not. But if they're doing it in a harsh way, that's a problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is correcting a factual inaccuracy, they might not be in the wrong. However, the approach might be questionable. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider intentions and the impact. The author's intention is to be honest, but the impact is causing social tension. The parents are the ones misleading others, but the author is the one getting labeled as the asshole for correcting. \n\nI think the answer here is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're correcting a factual error. The parents are the ones being deceptive, so the author is right to point that out. Even if the method is a bit confrontational, the act of correcting misinformation isn't wrong.\n"
