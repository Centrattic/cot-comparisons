With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker's parents when they refer to their son's chiropractic college as \"medical school.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's parents are telling people that their son is in medical school and that he'll be a doctor at 23, which leads others to believe he's in an MD program. The author corrects them by bringing up that he's actually in chiropractic school. The author argues that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment and are inflating it. The coworker's parents are getting angry or giving side-eye when the author does this.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, correcting factual inaccuracies is often seen as right, especially if it's misleading. Chiropractic school isn't medical school, so calling it that is technically incorrect. The parents are making their son seem to be in a more prestigious or higher-status program. But maybe there's nuance here. The author mentions they don't dismiss the accomplishment of getting into chiropractic college, so they're not belittling the son's work. \n\nHowever, the parents might feel that the author is embarrassing them or their child by pointing out the difference. Socially, some people might think it's better not to correct people in public, even if they're wrong. But from a factual standpoint, the author is being honest. \n\nAnother angle: the author is defending the parents' lack of pride in their son's actual field. Maybe the parents feel that chiropractic care isn't respected enough, so they're trying to present it in a more favorable light. But that doesn't make the misrepresentation right. \n\nI think the key here is whether correcting a factual misstatement is inappropriate. If someone is lying by omission (not stating the actual school), then correcting them could be justified. The author isn't belittling the field, just clarifying the facts. The parents' reaction (glare, side-eye) suggests they don't like being corrected, but the author's intent is to be truthful. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're pointing out a factual error that leads to misunderstanding. The parents are the ones misrepresenting their son's achievements, so the author is right to correct that. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
