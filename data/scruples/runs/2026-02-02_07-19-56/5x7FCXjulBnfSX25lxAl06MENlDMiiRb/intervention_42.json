With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a co-worker's parents who refer to their son attending \"Medical School\" when he's actually in chiropractic college. The author corrects them in social situations, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning is that chiropractic school is a different, less prestigious field compared to medical school. They feel the parents are inflating their son's achievements and aren't proud of his actual accomplishment. The author corrects them, possibly to set the record straight and to support the parents being proud of the real achievement. However, the parents seem to react negatively, giving side-eye or glares.\n\nThe key points here are: Are the parents misleading others by calling chiropractic school \"medical school\"? Is it the author's place to correct them in social situations? \n\nChiropractic and medical schools are distinct. Medical doctors (MDs) attend medical school, while chiropractors go to chiropractic colleges. The author might be right in pointing out the difference, but the parents' intention could be to elevate their son's status. However, the parents are the ones who have chosen to misrepresent the information, which is ethically questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is correcting them, which might be seen as overstepping. The author might not be aware of the parents' motivations. Maybe they feel embarrassed about their son's choice of profession and are trying to present it in a better light. The author's actions could be seen as publicly shaming them, which isn't kind. \n\nBut the author's intention is to highlight the actual achievement. If the parents are proud of their son's real accomplishment, they wouldn't need to lie. The author's correction could be a way to support honesty. However, the method of correction in social situations might be inappropriate. Public corrections can be awkward and may cause discomfort, which could be why the parents react negatively.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is being truthful and pointing out a factual inaccuracy, then perhaps they are in the right. However, the approach might be tactless. But if the parents are actively misrepresenting their son's status, maybe the author is justified. Alternatively, if the author is being condescending or not respecting the parents' feelings, that could be the issue.\n\nI think the main conflict is between honesty and sensitivity. The author is honest but might not be considering the parents' feelings. The parents are misrepresenting facts, which is wrong, but the author's method of correction could be unkind. So, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are intentionally misleading, the author is right to correct them. However, if the correction is done in a confrontational way without empathy, then maybe the author is being an asshole. But the author says they are not dismissing the accomplishment and are trying to highlight the real achievement. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they are pointing out a factual error, but maybe the approach could be more tactful. However, the parents are the ones starting the misrepresentation. The author's actions might be justified as they want to promote honesty. So perhaps the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
