With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker's parents who keep saying their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author corrects them every time, which leads to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are misrepresenting their son's education. Medical school typically refers to MD programs, which are different from Chiropractic schools. There might be a stigma or a perception that MDs are more prestigious, so the parents might be inflating his achievements. The author feels that they should be proud of the actual accomplishment and not mislead people.\n\nThe author's intention is to set the record straight. They mention that they don't dismiss the accomplishment of getting into Chiropractic school, which is valid. However, correcting in social situations might be seen as confrontational. But is it the author's place to do so?\n\nOn one hand, the parents are being dishonest or at least misleading. On the other hand, the author is bringing attention to the truth. The question is whether the author's actions are justified. If the parents are intentionally misleading others, the author's correction isn't wrong. However, if the author is being overly critical or causing unnecessary conflict, that might make them the asshole.\n\nBut the author's motivation seems to be genuine\u2014they want to acknowledge the real achievement and prevent misinformation. The parents' behavior might be rooted in their own biases or lack of understanding about Chiropractic care. The author isn't belittling the son's effort but pointing out the factual inaccuracy.\n\nIn social settings, correcting someone can be awkward, but if the author is doing it in a respectful way, maybe they're just being honest. The parents' negative reactions (glare, side-eye) suggest they're not happy with the correction, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The key is whether the author is acting in bad faith. Since they are trying to be truthful, maybe they're not the asshole here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have addressed this more privately instead of publicly correcting them, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The author's actions are based on a desire for honesty, which is commendable. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
