With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker about the son's school. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe coworker's son is in chiropractic college, but the parents and son refer to it as \"Medical School.\" They also say he's going to be a doctor at 23. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to glares or side-eye. The author believes the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment and are inflating it by calling it medical school. The author is defending the chiropractic profession's validity but still corrects the misrepresentation.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. Are chiropractors considered medical doctors? In the US, chiropractors earn a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree, but they aren't MDs (Medical Doctors). So, calling it \"Medical School\" is technically incorrect. However, people might colloquially refer to any graduate of a doctoral program as \"Doctor,\" which could be confusing. The parents might be using \"Medical School\" loosely, but the author takes it as a misrepresentation.\n\nIs there a cultural context where using \"Medical School\" for chiropractic is acceptable? Maybe not in the strictest sense. But some people might not make that distinction, especially if they're not in the field. The parents might be proud of their son's achievement and want to present it in a way that's respected or understood without explaining the nuances. They might not want to face potential biases against chiropractic.\n\nThe author's intention is to correct the misrepresentation. However, correcting in every social situation where the parents are present might be seen as confrontational or undermining their pride. The parents might feel that the author is belittling their son's accomplishment by pointing out the distinction. Even if the author isn't dismissing the effort required, the parents might perceive the correction as a judgment of the profession.\n\nThe author argues that the parents aren't proud because they don't mention the actual school. But maybe the parents are trying to present their son's path in a more prestigious light because of societal perceptions. They might feel that calling it chiropractic school would lead to misunderstandings or biases, hence the choice to frame it as medical school. The author's correction could be seen as not respecting their choice to frame the narrative in a way that they believe is more socially accepted.\n\nHowever, from a factual standpoint, the parents are technically misrepresenting the son's education. The author is pointing out the truth. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. If the author's correction is in good faith and without malice, but the parents perceive it as rude or condescending, then the author might be overstepping by correcting them publicly and repeatedly. The parents might prefer that the author supports their narrative rather than challenging it in front of others.\n\nAnother angle: the author is taking a personal stance against chiropractic (biased) but still corrects the parents. However, the author claims to set that bias aside and acknowledges the accomplishment. So the correction isn't about discrediting chiropractic but about factual accuracy. The parents might not see it that way, though, especially if they feel the author is subtly undermining their son's choice.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, correcting someone's family in a social setting can be seen as intrusive. Unless there's a direct impact on work or the author's role in the situation, it's possible that the author is overcorrecting. People might have their reasons for how they present their families, and the author's intervention might not be their place unless it's causing direct harm.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are based on factual correction, but the execution might be socially inappropriate. The parents' choice to present their son's education in a certain way might be their prerogative, and the author's persistent correction could be seen as intrusive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if the correction is causing distress and the parents have not asked for it. However, if the author is doing it out of a genuine concern for accuracy and not malice, some might see it as justified. But in terms of social etiquette, correcting others' family in such a manner could be seen as the author's fault.\n"
