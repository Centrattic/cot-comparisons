With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he says his son is in medical school, but it's actually chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's parents are making a big deal about their son being in \"Medical School,\" which might be misleading because chiropractic and medical (MD) schools are different. The author feels that the parents are not being proud of the actual accomplishment and instead inflating it. \n\nNow, the key points here. Chiropractors are not MDs. Medical school leads to a Doctor of Medicine degree, while chiropractic school leads to a Doctor of Chiropractic. So, the author is technically correct in pointing out the difference. But the parents might be doing this for various reasons\u2014maybe they don't want to explain the distinction, or they personally see chiropractic as part of the medical field, even if it's not in the traditional sense.\n\nThe author is correcting them in social situations, which others might perceive as embarrassing or confrontational. The parents are getting negative reactions like glares or side-eye. Is that the right approach? Well, it's about honesty versus social sensitivity. The author believes the parents are being dishonest by not mentioning the actual school, but maybe the parents are just using a term they think people will understand better. \n\nAlso, the parents might be proud of their son's achievement, but feel that \"Medical School\" sounds more prestigious. The author's intention is to highlight the real accomplishment, but perhaps the parents are not misrepresenting the field in a malicious way. They might be misunderstanding the difference themselves, or they might be trying to avoid stigma around chiropractic as a profession.\n\nThe author is not dismissing the accomplishment, which is a good point. They acknowledge the hard work and pride in that. However, correcting others in social settings could be seen as overstepping, especially if the parents have a different perspective. It's possible the author is right in wanting the truth told, but the method of correction might be causing more harm than good. \n\nOn the other hand, if the parents are intentionally misleading people, then the author has a valid reason to correct them. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents' actions might be problematic, but the author's response of correcting in every situation and facing negative reactions could be too direct. Maybe the author should address it privately instead of publicly. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't the asshole, but their approach could be improved. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is trying to correct a factual error, they are right in that. But if they are causing discomfort in social settings without considering the parents' feelings, maybe they are in the wrong. The line between correcting a factual inaccuracy and being a social disrupter is thin here. \n\nBut since the author's intention is to highlight the real accomplishment and not discredit it, their actions are well-meaning. However, the parents might not see it that way. So, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are pointing out a factual difference. But there's a nuance in social interactions where perhaps the author should be more tactful. However, the main question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
