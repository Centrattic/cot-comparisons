With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for correcting their coworker's parents who claim their son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's parents are misrepresenting their son's education. They say he's in medical school and will be a doctor at 23, which leads people to think he's in an MD program. The author corrects them, pointing out it's chiropractic school. The parents react negatively with glares and side-eye. The author's reasoning is that they should be proud of the actual accomplishment and not misrepresent it.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about correction versus overstepping. On one hand, the author is being honest and clarifying the truth, which could be seen as right because they're not allowing misinformation to spread. On the other hand, maybe the parents have their own reasons for presenting it differently\u2014perhaps societal stigma against chiropractors, or they just want to sound better. The author might be causing embarrassment or damaging the parents' pride by correcting them publicly.\n\nBut the author also mentions that they are not dismissing the accomplishment itself. They acknowledge that chiropractic school is hard and the son is worthy of pride. The issue is the misrepresentation. So the author's correction is about truth, not the value of the degree. \n\nIs it the author's place to correct them in social settings? That depends on the context. If the author is a close friend or family member, maybe it's more appropriate. But they're just a coworker. Publicly correcting someone else's family might be seen as intrusive. However, if the author is in a situation where others are being misled, maybe they have a responsibility to speak up, especially if it's a matter of professional misrepresentation.\n\nAnother angle: the parents might not want to correct the perception because they're ashamed or don't understand the difference. The author's correction could be helping others have accurate information. But it's also possible the author is overstepping by inserting themselves into family matters. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the key is intent. The author's intent is to correct misinformation, which is a positive intent. However, the method might be problematic\u2014doing it in social situations where it's not necessary or requested. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the parents privately first instead of correcting them publicly each time. But the author is doing it every time, leading to negative reactions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They are trying to be honest, but the delivery might not be considerate. The parents might feel their personal choices are being judged. The author isn't malicious but is causing discomfort. The answer depends on whether correcting the misinformation is more important than respecting the parents' desire to present it differently. \n\nIn the end, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're pointing out the truth without malice and the parents are the ones misrepresenting. The author isn't belittling the achievement but correcting the mislabeling. However, there's a balance between being right and being respectful. But since the parents are the ones being deceptive, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
