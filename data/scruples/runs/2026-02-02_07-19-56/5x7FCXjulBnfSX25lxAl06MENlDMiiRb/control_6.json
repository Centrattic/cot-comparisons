With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting a coworker and their family who refer to the son's chiropractic college as \"Medical School\" and claim he's becoming a doctor at 23. The author feels it's important to set the record straight because others might be misled into thinking he's in an MD program. The coworker's family then gives the author side-eye when corrected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author is justified in correcting the coworker's parents. The author isn't dismissing the accomplishment of attending chiropractic college but is concerned about the misrepresentation. On the other hand, the parents might feel that the author is belittling their son's achievements by pointing out the difference.\n\nChiropractic college and medical school are different in terms of curriculum and the resulting profession. Medical school leads to MDs, while chiropractic school leads to DCs. It's a valid distinction because the professions are distinct. However, the way the parents present their son's education might be misleading to others who aren't familiar with the difference. The author's intention is to correct misinformation, which could be seen as honest and truthful.\n\nBut there's also the social aspect. The author might be causing discomfort for the parents by correcting them in social settings. Sometimes, people might prefer to present their achievements in a way that they feel is more socially accepted or prestigious, even if it's a bit of a stretch. The author's actions could be seen as prying or not respecting the parents' wishes to present their son's achievements in a certain way.\n\nHowever, the line between correcting misinformation and overstepping can be thin. If the author is doing this in every social situation and getting negative reactions, maybe the frequency or manner of correction is an issue. The parents might feel that the author is making a big deal out of a small difference, especially if they themselves are proud of the chiropractic path but feel it's less respected and thus exaggerate.\n\nAnother angle: The author is right to point out the factual inaccuracy but might not be considering the parents' motivations. They could be trying to elevate their son's status in a society that sometimes undervalues non-traditional medical professions. The author's insistence on the truth might be well-intentioned but could come off as unsympathetic to the parents' feelings.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between honesty and kindness. The author isn't being malicious but is also not allowing the parents to present their child's achievements as they see fit. It's possible that the author's corrections are causing more harm by embarrassing the parents, even if the information is technically accurate.\n\nSo, the question is whether the correction is necessary or if it's the author's responsibility to speak up even if it causes tension. Since the parents are the ones choosing to misrepresent the information, the author might not be in the wrong for correcting it. However, the way it's done and the frequency could be problematic. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific context of the conversations. But based on the information given, the author is attempting to provide accurate information, which is generally the right thing to do, even if it's uncomfortable.\n"
