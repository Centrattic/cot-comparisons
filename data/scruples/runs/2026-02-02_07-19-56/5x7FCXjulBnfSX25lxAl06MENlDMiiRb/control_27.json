With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by correcting their coworker's parents when they falsely claimed their son is in medical school instead of chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are misrepresenting their son's educational path. Chiropractic school isn't medical school, so the parents are technically incorrect. The author is correcting this, which could be seen as being honest or as being judgmental. \n\nThe author mentions they have a bias against chiropractic medicine but also acknowledges the effort required. The key here is whether the author's correction was about truth or their own bias. If the author is motivated by correcting misinformation, that's one angle. But if they're doing it to undermine the parents' pride, that's another.\n\nThe parents might feel the author is not respecting their achievements by pointing this out. Socially, correcting people in public can be seen as rude, especially if the correction is about a personal matter. The parents might be proud of their son's accomplishment regardless of the field, and the author's intervention could be hurtful or unnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, if the parents are intentionally misleading others, the author might believe they have a duty to correct the misinformation. However, the author's approach might not be the best. Maybe a private conversation would have been better instead of public correction leading to tension.\n\nThe decision hinges on intent and method. If the author's correction is based on a genuine desire to correct false information and they are respectful, it might be justified. But since the parents perceive it as negative and the author has admitted a personal bias, it could be seen as the author overstepping. The parents' pride in their son's hard work isn't invalidated by the field's prestige, so the author's focus on correcting the title might be misdirected.\n"
