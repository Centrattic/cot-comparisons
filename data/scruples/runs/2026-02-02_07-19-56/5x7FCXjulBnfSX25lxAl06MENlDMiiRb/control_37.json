With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he refers to his son being in \"Medical School,\" when it's actually Chiropractic college. The coworker's family consistently says medical school and mentions the son will be a \"practicing doctor at 23,\" which leads others to assume an MD program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Chiropractic college is a legitimate educational path, just different from medical school. The coworker's family might be emphasizing the prestige or the common misconception that chiropractors are medical doctors, even though they're not. The author is correcting this, which could be seen as factual, but maybe the family has their reasons for how they present their son's achievements.\n\nThe author mentions they do this in social situations, getting negative reactions like side-eye. The key points are: the author is being factual but the family is choosing to present the information differently. The author believes the family isn't proud of the actual accomplishment, hence their corrections. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, correcting misinformation is generally a good thing, but maybe the family has their own reasons for how they present their son's education. They might value the effort and success in chiropractic school and want to highlight that in a way that others understand the prestige. The author's corrections could be undermining the family's way of showing pride, even if it's not technically accurate. \n\nHowever, the author isn't dismissing the accomplishment. They acknowledge the effort required. The issue is the misrepresentation. If the family is intentionally misleading others about the nature of the program, the author has a right to correct that. But if the family is just using different terminology without intending to deceive, the author's corrections might come off as judgmental or intrusive. \n\nIt's also about intent. The author's intent is to present the facts, which is correct, but the family's intent might be to manage others' perceptions. The problem arises in social contexts where the author's corrections could be embarrassing or hurtful. The author might not be in the wrong factually, but the approach could be tactless. However, since the author is being honest and not malicious, maybe they're justified. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is making a habit of correcting every time, even in private settings, that could be seen as overstepping. The family's choice to present their son's education in a certain way, while technically incorrect, might be a personal decision. The author's corrections might not be their place if it's causing discomfort. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong for correcting the misinformation, but the manner might be an issue. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. Since the author is being factual and not malicious, the answer would be B (No). But if the correction is causing unnecessary conflict without a good reason, maybe A. But the key is the author is pointing out factual inaccuracies, which are important. So, B.\n"
