With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker's parents who refer to their son's chiropractic school as \"medical school\" and claim he'll be a practicing doctor at 23. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to glares and side-eye. The author believes the parents aren't proud of his actual accomplishment and that they're inflating his achievements by omitting the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Chiropractic schools are separate from medical schools, and the degrees (DC vs. MD/DO) are different. The parents' statements could be seen as misleading because people might confuse chiropractic with medical doctors. However, the author's motivation is to correct the misinformation, even if it's to highlight the parents' possible lack of pride in the actual accomplishment.\n\nThe author might argue that they're being truthful and not allowing the parents to misrepresent their son's education. On the other hand, the parents might feel that their son's achievements are still significant, and they're just using a more marketable term. The question is whether the author overstepped by correcting them in social settings, which could be seen as publicly embarrassing the parents or undermining their pride.\n\nIn terms of social norms, correcting someone's parents in a social setting, especially if they're already sensitive about it, can be considered rude. People often share their achievements in a way that makes them feel proud, even if it's not entirely accurate. The author's actions might be well-intentioned, but the method could be inappropriate. The parents are entitled to feel proud of their son's accomplishments, even if they frame them in a certain way. The author's insistence on the truth might not account for the parents' perspective and could be seen as unsolicited correction.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions their own bias against the profession but says they're not dismissing the accomplishment. However, the parents' desire to present their son's education as \"medical school\" could be a way to gain more recognition in a society that often undervalues non-MD healthcare professions. The author's correction might inadvertently feed into that bias.\n\nSo, while the author's intent is to correct misinformation, the approach might be considered inconsiderate. The key issue is whether the correction is necessary and respectful. Publicly correcting someone's parents in a social setting, especially when it's clear they don't appreciate it, could be seen as the author being an asshole. The author should consider whether the correction is truly needed for the sake of accuracy or if it's a way to subtly criticize the parents' pride in their son's choice of profession.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because their actions, though based on a desire for truth, are causing discomfort and could be perceived as rude or dismissive of the parents' pride. The appropriate approach might be to privately discuss the matter if it's a concern, rather than correcting them publicly in social situations.\n"
