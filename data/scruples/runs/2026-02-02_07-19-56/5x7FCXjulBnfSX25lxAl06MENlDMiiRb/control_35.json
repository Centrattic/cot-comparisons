With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when the coworker says their son is in medical school, but he's actually in chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's parents consistently refer to the son's chiropractic school as \"medical school\" and claim he'll be a doctor at 23. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to glares or side-eye. The author's reasoning is that the parents aren't proud of their son's actual accomplishment and are inflating it. They want the parents to be proud of the real achievement.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for correcting them. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, correcting factual inaccuracies is sometimes necessary to prevent misinformation. If the author is trying to set the record straight, especially in public, it's understandable. However, doing so in social situations might cause embarrassment, especially if the parents are not open to the correction. The author might be overstepping if it's done without the parents' consent or if it's causing tension without a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are misrepresenting their son's education. Chiropractic school is a legitimate field, but it's different from medical school. The parents might be trying to elevate their son's status by associating with the term \"medical school,\" which could be misleading. The author's intention is to acknowledge the real achievement rather than the exaggerated one. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author is not wrong for wanting to prevent misinformation, but the approach might be problematic. Public corrections can be seen as confrontational, especially in informal settings. The author might not be in the wrong for the intent, but the method of correction could be seen as tactless. Additionally, the coworkers might not appreciate the author inserting themselves into their personal conversations to correct them, even if the facts are incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions their own bias against chiropractic but acknowledges the son's accomplishment. However, by correcting the parents, the author might inadvertently be downplaying the significance of the chiropractic field, which could be perceived as dismissive. Even if the author is trying to be neutral, the act of correction might still be seen as undermining the parents' pride.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the parents might feel that their son's achievements are being belittled. The author's corrections could be causing discomfort without a clear benefit. The key here is whether the correction is necessary in every social situation. Maybe the author should consider a more private approach if they want to address the misinformation without causing public embarrassment.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be justified in terms of factual accuracy, but the method and context could be contributing to the tension. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author is doing it out of a genuine desire to correct misinformation, maybe not. But if they're doing it in a way that's causing discomfort without a constructive purpose, then perhaps they are overstepping. The answer might hinge on the intent and the approach taken.\n"
