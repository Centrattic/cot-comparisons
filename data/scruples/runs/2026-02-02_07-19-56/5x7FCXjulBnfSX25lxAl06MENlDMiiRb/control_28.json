With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a co-worker whose parents are describing their son's enrollment in chiropractic school as being in \"Medical School\" and claiming he'll be a doctor at 23.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author corrects their co-worker and the co-worker's parents by mentioning the son is in chiropractic school, not medical school. The parents seem to be inflating the son's achievements, perhaps to make it sound more prestigious. The author feels the parents should be proud of the actual accomplishment rather than the inflated version.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for correcting them. Let's break it down. Correcting factual inaccuracies is generally seen as right, especially if the co-worker is misrepresenting information. Medical school leads to an MD or DO, while chiropractic school leads to a DC. They are different in terms of education, training, and the scope of practice. So, if the parents are calling chiropractic school \"medical school,\" that's technically incorrect. The author is pointing out the difference, which might be seen as correcting misinformation.\n\nHowever, there's a social aspect here. The parents might feel embarrassed or defensive if corrected publicly. The author is doing this in social situations, leading to negative reactions like side-eye. The line between being factual and being a \"know-it-all\" can be thin. The author's motivation is to be truthful, but the manner in which they do it might be causing discomfort. They might be overstepping if their corrections are done in a way that's condescending or if it's done frequently in every conversation, making it a point of contention each time.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely trying to correct a misrepresentation, they are right to do so. Chiropractic care is a legitimate field, but it's not the same as medical school. The parents might be conflating the two, which could be misleading to others. The author is advocating for honesty, even if the parents are trying to present their son's achievements in a more favorable light.\n\nAnother angle: the author is not trying to undermine the son's accomplishment, as they acknowledge that chiropractic school is hard to get into. Their issue is with the misrepresentation. The parents might be projecting their own biases or societal perceptions, which the author is challenging. It's possible that the author is right in pointing out the distinction, but the approach could be improved to be more tactful.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's about intent and the effect. If the author is doing this to embarrass the parents or make a point, then it's more likely they're in the wrong. If it's to correct misinformation politely, maybe not. The key here is whether the corrections are necessary and delivered correctly. The author might not be in the wrong for factually correcting the misstatement, but they might be too aggressive in their approach, leading to the negative reactions.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives: the author is right in pointing out the factual difference, but the way they do it might be causing unnecessary tension. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the correction is factually accurate and well-intentioned, the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong). But if the corrections are done in a way that's causing harm without good reason, then A (Yes). But the author does mention that they include the correct information in conversation, not necessarily to mock but to inform. So leaning towards B.\n"
