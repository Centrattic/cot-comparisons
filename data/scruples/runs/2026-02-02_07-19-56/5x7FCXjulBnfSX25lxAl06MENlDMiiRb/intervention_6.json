With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting a coworker who says their son is in medical school, but he's actually in chiropractic college. The author corrects them every time, leading to glares from the parents. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The parents and coworker are stating that their son is in medical school and will be a doctor at 23. But technically, chiropractic college isn't medical school, and the degree isn't an MD. So the author is pointing out the factual inaccuracy. However, the parents might be proud of their son's achievements in chiropractic school, even if they present it as medical school. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for correcting them. On one hand, the author is being honest and correcting misinformation, which is important for accuracy. On the other hand, the parents might feel that their son's accomplishments are being downplayed by the correction, or maybe they're just trying to present it in a more prestigious light. The author's intention is to highlight the actual achievement, not to belittle it. \n\nBut maybe the parents are being misleading intentionally, using \"medical school\" to imply a higher status. The author's correction could be seen as necessary to avoid spreading false information. However, the parents' motivation is unclear. Are they embarrassed about chiropractic college, or do they genuinely not understand the difference in perception? \n\nAlso, the author mentions they aren't dismissing the accomplishment, which is a positive. But if the parents are proud of their son's work in chiropractic school, the author's correction might be undermining their pride by pointing out the difference. However, the author's reasoning is that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment if they're inflating it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's often seen as impolite to correct others in social settings unless necessary. The author is doing it in every conversation, which could be seen as overcorrecting. The parents might feel disrespected. However, there's also a responsibility to correct factual inaccuracies, especially if others are being misled. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the correction is done in a respectful way to inform others, it's justified. But if it's done in a judgmental manner to embarrass the parents, then it's not. The author's tone isn't clear here, but the intent seems to be to highlight the truth. However, repeatedly correcting and causing discomfort might be unnecessary. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might not be in the wrong if the intention is to correct misinformation. But the approach could be problematic if it's causing unnecessary conflict. However, the parents' choice to misrepresent their son's education is the initial issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the facts.\n"
