With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker's parents who say their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in chiropractic school. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to negative reactions from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author isn't dismissing the accomplishment of attending chiropractic school; they acknowledge it's hard work. The main issue is the parents misrepresenting the son's education. The author feels they should be proud of what he's actually doing and not inflate his achievements. \n\nSo, the question is whether correcting the parents in social settings is the right thing to do. On one hand, the author is being honest and preventing misinformation. On the other, the parents might have their own reasons for downplaying the chiropractic field, maybe due to social stigma or personal biases. The author is challenging them in public, which might be seen as confronting or embarrassing them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but others might argue it's about honesty. However, there's a cultural aspect here. In some contexts, correcting someone's family's achievements might be seen as overstepping, even if the facts are incorrect. The parents might feel the need to present their child's achievements in a more prestigious light, even if it's a misrepresentation. \n\nAlso, the author's intention is to highlight the parents' lack of pride in their son's actual accomplishment. But maybe the parents are trying to protect their son's aspirations or avoid judgment. The author's correction could be seen as public shaming, even if well-intentioned. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, interrupting a conversation to correct someone, especially in a family context, is often frowned upon. The author might be right in the facts but wrong in the approach. The parents might prefer to handle the corrections themselves, and the author is stepping into their space. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're correcting the parents publicly, which could be seen as rude, even if their intent is to be truthful. The parents are entitled to their pride, and the author's actions are causing discomfort. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
