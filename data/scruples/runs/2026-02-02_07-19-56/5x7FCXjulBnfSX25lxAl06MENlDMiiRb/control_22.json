With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when they mention their son is in medical school instead of chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's son is in chiropractic school, but they call it \"Medical School.\" The author feels that this is misleading because people might think it's an MD program. The author corrects them in social situations, which makes the parents glare or side-eye. The author's reasoning is that the parents should be proud of the actual accomplishment, not the inflated version. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are: the coworker is misrepresenting their son's education, the author corrects them, and the author believes the parents aren't proud of the actual field. The author isn't dismissing the accomplishment but is pointing out the misrepresentation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. If someone is intentionally misleading others about their child's education, then correcting that fact might be justified. However, the author is doing this in social situations, which could be seen as embarrassing the parents publicly. Even if the intent is to be honest, the method might come across as confrontational. \n\nThere's a difference between private correction and public correction. The author might be right in wanting the truth told, but doing so in front of others could be hurtful. On the other hand, if the parents are being dishonest, the author's correction is a way to set the record straight. \n\nBut the author's motivation is to highlight the parents' lack of pride in the actual field. The parents might not see chiropractic as prestigious as MDs, hence the misrepresentation. The author's correction is to make them proud of the real achievement. However, the parents might feel embarrassed or that their son's choice isn't valued. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer could hinge on the context. If the author is correcting facts without malice and not belittling the accomplishment, maybe not. But if the correction is causing discomfort and the parents are not open to it, the author might be overstepping. \n\nIn some cases, people have strong feelings about how their family is portrayed. The author's actions could be seen as necessary for truth, but others might say it's meddling in family matters. The parents have the right to represent their son's education as they see fit, even if it's misleading. The author's intervention might be well-intentioned but could be causing more harm by creating tension. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they are pointing out a factual misrepresentation. However, the way they do it might be socially awkward, but that doesn't make them an asshole. The parents are the ones being dishonest, so the author's correction is justified. The key is that the author isn't belittling the accomplishment but correcting the misstatement. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
