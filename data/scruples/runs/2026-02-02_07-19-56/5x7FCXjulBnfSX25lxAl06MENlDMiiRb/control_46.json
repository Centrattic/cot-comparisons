With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker whose son is in chiropractic school, but the parents always say he's in medical school and call him a \"practicing doctor at 23.\" The author feels the need to correct this, leading to tension. The question is whether the author is right or wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker's parents are intentionally misrepresenting their son's educational path. Chiropractic school is not the same as medical school (MD program). By claiming their son is in medical school, they might be misleading others into thinking he's on a different, more traditional medical path, which is a different profession altogether. The author is correcting this, which the parents react negatively to with glares. The author's motivation is to highlight the parents' possible lack of pride in their son's actual accomplishments, suggesting they feel they need to inflate the story.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations. Is the author justified in correcting them? Well, if the parents are intentionally misleading others by omitting key details, then the author might have a valid point in bringing up the truth. However, the author is choosing to correct them in social situations where the parents are present, which could be seen as public shaming or confrontation. The author's actions might be well-intentioned (correcting misinformation), but the method of doing so in social settings could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have a right to be proud of their son's achievements in chiropractic school, which is a legitimate and challenging field. The author mentions their own bias against the profession but acknowledges the accomplishment. So, the parents aren't necessarily belittling their son's achievements; they might just be trying to present them in a more traditional or prestigious light in their communities. However, misrepresenting the field as medical school is a misrepresentation of facts.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole for correcting the parents. The parents are the ones spreading the misinformation. The author is pointing out the truth, which could be seen as right, but the way they do it (interjecting in conversations where the parents are present) might be seen as confrontational. The parents might not appreciate being corrected in front of others, which could be considered rude regardless of the truth.\n\nBut the alternative is that the author is trying to prevent others from being misled. Chiropractic and medical school are different, and if the parents are misrepresenting, others might form incorrect assumptions. The author's corrections are factual and might be necessary. However, the author's approach could be more diplomatic. Instead of directly correcting in the moment, perhaps a private conversation with the parents could be more appropriate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about intent and the impact of one's actions. The author's intent is to correct misinformation, which is a valid concern. The impact is causing tension and embarrassment for the parents, which might be hurtful. However, if the parents are intentionally misleading, the author has a right to speak up. But in social settings, being the one to correct others can be seen as impolite unless done tactfully.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are not necessarily wrong, but their method might be. The parents are the ones providing false information, so the author isn't the asshole for pointing it out. However, the way they do it could be seen as tactless. But in AITA terms, the focus is on whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is correcting a factual inaccuracy, even if the delivery could be better, they might not be the asshole.\n"
