With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker's parents who inaccurately claim their son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic school.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's family is presenting chiropractic education as medical school, leading others to assume an MD path. The author corrects this in social settings, which upsets the family. The question is whether the author is justified in their actions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that chiropractic school is its own valid accomplishment, and the parents are inflating their son's achievements by misrepresenting it. They correct to prevent others from having the wrong impression. The coworker's parents might be embarrassed or not proud of chiropractic, hence the misrepresentation.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong here. The parents are being deceptive, which could be seen as dishonest. The author is correcting the record, which can be seen as honest. But maybe the author is overstepping by publicly correcting them, causing embarrassment. Is that necessary? The author's intent is to acknowledge the real accomplishment, but doing so in a social setting might not be the best approach. However, the family is actively misleading people, so the correction isn't just about facts but also about preventing misinformation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on intent and context. If the author is being truthful and the parents are lying, then the author isn't the asshole. However, maybe the author should have approached it privately first. But the scenario says they correct in every social situation, which might be confrontational. Still, the parents are the ones misrepresenting facts. So the author is not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
