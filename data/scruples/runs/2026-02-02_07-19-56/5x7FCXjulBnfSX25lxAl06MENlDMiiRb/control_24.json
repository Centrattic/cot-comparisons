With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for correcting their coworker and the coworker's parents when they refer to the son being in \"Medical School\" instead of Chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker's family is consistently misrepresenting the son's education. Medical school typically leads to becoming a medical doctor (MD), while chiropractic school leads to a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC). These are different professions with different educational requirements and scopes of practice. The parents might be inflating their son's achievements by using the term \"Medical School,\" possibly to make it sound more prestigious.\n\nThe author corrects them in social situations, which leads to tension. The author's reasoning is that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment and are misleading others. The key points here are accuracy and the parents' intentions. The author is standing by the truth, which is important, but maybe they're not considering the parents' feelings or their reasons for the misrepresentation.\n\nHowever, correcting someone in social settings can be seen as confrontational. The parents might have their own reasons for the misstatement\u2014perhaps they feel societal stigma against chiropractors, or they want to present their son's achievements in a more favorable light. The author's intention is to be truthful, which is valid, but the method of correction in public might be inappropriate, especially if it's causing discomfort or embarrassment.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are the ones misrepresenting facts, which could be seen as dishonest. The author is pointing out the truth, which is their right, but the way they do it (public correction) might be the issue. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong for factually correcting misinformation, but maybe they could approach it more sensitively, like a private conversation instead of public correction. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the best approach.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, correcting someone's misstatement in a public setting can be seen as rude, even if the correction is true. So, the author's actions might be justified in terms of honesty, but the method might not be the best. However, the parents are the ones making the misstatements, so the author isn't necessarily wrong for correcting them. The answer might depend on whether the correction is necessary and how it's delivered. Given that the parents are repeatedly making the same mistake, the author's correction is an attempt to address the misinformation, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for correcting the misstatement, but maybe the approach could be improved. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best method. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because they're correcting a factual inaccuracy, even if the delivery is causing tension.\n"
