With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a co-worker whose parents say their son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic college. The author corrects them in social situations, even though they acknowledge that the son is still accomplished. The author feels that the parents aren't proud of the actual achievement, hence the misleading statements.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if correcting is the right move. On one hand, the parents are misrepresenting their son's education. Chiropractors aren't MDs, so calling it medical school could be misleading. The author is pointing out the truth, which could be seen as honest. But maybe the parents are trying to downplay the stigma around chiropractic care, or they just see it as a way to sound more prestigious. \n\nThe author's intention is to correct the misinformation, but the parents might feel embarrassed or defensive. The author might be overstepping if they're not considering the parents' reasons. However, the parents are providing false information, which could be a problem if others are making incorrect assumptions. \n\nIs the author an asshole? It depends on context. If the corrections are done in a respectful way, maybe not. But the parents are clearly uncomfortable with the corrections. The author might not be considering the parents' feelings or their reasons for the misrepresentation. The line between honesty and being judgmental is thin here. \n\nI think there's a balance. While the author has a point about the misrepresentation, they might be being harsh without understanding the parents' motivations. The parents could be dealing with their own biases or trying to protect their child's achievements. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might be causing unnecessary tension. So, maybe the author is partially at fault, but not entirely. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they are correcting others' statements, which is a form of honesty, but the parents are the ones providing false info. The author's actions are a response to that. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but I need to check if the author's approach is respectful enough. The story doesn't mention if the author is being rude, just that they interject. If they do it in a respectful manner, it's more defensible. If they are being confrontational, then maybe A. But the story says they get side-eye, which might imply the parents are defensive, but the author's approach could still be justified. I think the answer is B.\n"
