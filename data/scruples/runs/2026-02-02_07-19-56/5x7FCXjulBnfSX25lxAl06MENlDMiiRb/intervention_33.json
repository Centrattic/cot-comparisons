With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who corrected their co-worker about the son's school is in the wrong. The situation is that the co-worker's son is in chiropractic college, but they refer to him as being in medical school and mention he'll be a doctor at 23. The author feels they need to correct this in social situations, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Chiropractic school is different from medical school, so technically, calling it \"medical school\" is incorrect. However, chiropractors do earn a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree, which is a doctoral title. So, when the parents say their son will be a \"practicing doctor,\" they're not entirely wrong because chiropractors are addressed as \"Dr.\" even if they aren't MDs. But the public might not know this, leading to misunderstandings.\n\nThe author's intention is to correct the misinformation, believing that the parents should take pride in the actual accomplishment rather than inflating it. However, correcting in social settings might be seen as rude or causing embarrassment. The parents' perspective is important here. If they're genuinely proud of their son's chiropractic achievements but use the term \"medical school\" out of ignorance or to sound more impressive, the author's correction could be justified. But if the parents are intentionally misleading people to inflate their son's status, the author might be right in pointing that out.\n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. Are they biased against chiropractic medicine? The author mentions setting aside their personal bias, but if that's the case, they might still have an agenda. The parents might not see the correction as helpful but as an attack on their pride in their child's achievements.\n\nSocial dynamics matter here. Correcting someone publicly, especially in a family setting, can be awkward and hurtful. The author might not realize that the parents take pride in the \"medical school\" label, even if it's inaccurate. It's possible the parents are unaware of the distinction or use the term in a way that's acceptable in their social circle. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if they're the only one correcting, leading to the glares and side eye mentioned.\n\nAlso, the term \"practicing doctor at 23\" could be misleading if people assume it's an MD. However, since chiropractors can be 23 when graduating, it's technically true. The author's correction might stem from a desire to prevent others from making incorrect assumptions, but it's a delicate situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for correcting the misinformation, but the way they do it could be considered rude. The parents might have their own reasons for the terminology, and the author's approach could be more tactful. So, while there's merit in the author's point, the method of correction and the social context might make them the asshole.\n"
