With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for correcting their coworker about his son's education. The coworker's son is in chiropractic college, but they refer to it as \"medical school\" and mention he'll be a \"practicing doctor at 23.\" The author intervenes to clarify the actual program, leading to some tension with the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. Chiropractic school is indeed different from medical school (MD programs). They require different prerequisites and have distinct curricula. Calling chiropractic a medical school could be misleading because it's a different field of study. The parents are presenting their son's achievements in a way that might mislead others into thinking he's pursuing a medical doctorate rather than a chiropractic one.\n\nThe author's motivation is to correct the misinformation, not to belittle the accomplishment. They acknowledge the hard work required for chiropractic school. The issue is the parents' choice to misrepresent the son's education. The author is trying to set the record straight, which could be seen as a positive action, but it's causing discomfort for the parents.\n\nNow, considering if the author is wrong. Correcting false information is generally seen as right, especially when it's a matter of fact. However, the context matters. Is the coworker's family being deceptive, or are they simply using colloquial terms? If they're intentionally misleading people, the author is right to correct them. But if they're just using \"medical school\" informally without deceptive intent, the author might be overstepping.\n\nThe parents' reaction (glare, side eye) suggests they might feel defensive or embarrassed. The author is in a social setting where they feel compelled to clarify, possibly to prevent others from forming incorrect assumptions. The key here is whether the correction is necessary and respectful. Since the author isn't belittling the accomplishment but factually correcting the statement, it seems justified.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for the parents to be proud of the actual achievement but feel the need to inflate it. The author's reasoning is that if they were truly proud, they wouldn't misrepresent it. This could indicate that the parents are ashamed of chiropractic and are trying to present it as something more prestigious. The author's intervention supports the son's genuine accomplishment, which is valid.\n\nIn terms of social norms, correcting someone in a conversation can sometimes be seen as confrontational, but if the information is factually incorrect, it's often considered the right thing to do. The author isn't attacking the parents but clarifying a factual error. The parents' reaction might stem from feeling corrected in front of others, which can be uncomfortable regardless of the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They are addressing a factual misrepresentation without malice, supporting the son's real achievements. The parents' behavior is questionable for the misrepresentation, and the author's correction is appropriate.\n"
