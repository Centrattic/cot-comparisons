With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong when they correct their coworker about their son's education. The coworker's son is in chiropractic school, but the parents refer to it as \"medical school\" and claim he'll be a doctor at 23. The author feels the parents aren't being proud of the actual accomplishment and corrects them in social situations, which leads to glare or side-eye from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they have a bias against chiropractors but acknowledge the effort required. However, the main issue is the parents misrepresenting the son's education. The author's intention is to correct the misinformation, which could be seen as standing up for accuracy. On the other hand, correcting others in social situations might be perceived as rude, especially if it's done publicly or in a condescending way. The parents might feel embarrassed or defensive, leading to the negative reactions described.\n\nThe key points are: Is correcting someone's misrepresentation of their child's achievements appropriate? How does the method of correction affect this? The author's motivation is to highlight the actual accomplishment, which is valid, but the way they do it might be the issue. Public corrections can be awkward and may not be the best approach. Also, the parents might have their own reasons for referring to it as medical school, even if it's technically incorrect, such as societal perceptions or their own understanding. However, the parents might be misleading others intentionally, which is ethically questionable.\n\nThe line between being factually correct and being socially considerate is thin here. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to prevent misinformation, but the method might be the problem. It's possible the author is in the right by correcting, but perhaps in a tactless manner. Alternatively, the parents are misrepresenting their son's achievements, so the author isn't in the wrong for pointing that out. It's a bit of a gray area. The final answer depends on whether the focus is on the intent to correct misinformation or the social etiquette of doing so.\n"
