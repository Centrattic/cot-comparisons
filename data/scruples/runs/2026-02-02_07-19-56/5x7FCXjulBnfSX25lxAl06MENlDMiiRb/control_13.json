With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the coworker's parents claiming their son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic college. The author corrects them every time, which leads to side-eye or glares from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents are misrepresenting their son's education. The author, knowing this, corrects them in social settings. The author argues that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment, hence the misrepresentation. The question is whether the author is right to correct them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is correcting someone's false statements in a social context. On one hand, the parents are being dishonest about their son's education, which could be misleading others. The author is pointing out the truth, which might be seen as honesty. On the other hand, the author is publicly correcting the parents, which might cause embarrassment or conflict. \n\nBut the parents are the ones lying. The author isn't making up a story; they're correcting a factual inaccuracy. However, maybe the author went about it the wrong way. Maybe they should have discussed this privately instead of in public. But in the story, the author is in social situations where they bring up the correct information. The parents react negatively because they don't want the truth to come out. \n\nThe parents might have their own reasons for misrepresenting their son's education, perhaps due to stigma or a lack of understanding about chiropractic care. The author's intention is to acknowledge the real achievement and not let others be misled. \n\nLegally, there's no issue. Ethically, it's about whether the author has the right to correct the parents' misrepresentation. If the author is not being malicious, but rather factual, then maybe they're justified. However, if the author is doing it in a condescending or harsh way, that could make them the asshole. The story doesn't mention tone, but the parents' reaction suggests they're defensive. \n\nAnother angle: if the parents are proud of their son's actual accomplishments, why hide them? The author's correction is to highlight the real achievement. The parents' denial might indicate they're ashamed or not supportive, which the author is trying to address. \n\nSo, in terms of being the asshole, the parents are the ones spreading misinformation. The author is bringing the truth to light. Unless the author is doing it in a harmful way, they might not be in the wrong. But maybe the method matters. If the author is correcting them in a respectful manner, then it's okay. If they're being confrontational, that's different. The story says the author \"works\" the correct information into the conversation, which might imply a tactful approach. \n\nOverall, the parents are the ones being dishonest. The author is correcting false information, which is a valid stance. Unless the author is making it personal or causing unnecessary conflict, they might not be the asshole here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
