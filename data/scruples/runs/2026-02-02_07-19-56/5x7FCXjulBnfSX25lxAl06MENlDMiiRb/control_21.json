With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting a coworker and their parents who are misrepresenting their son's education. The coworker's son is in chiropractic school, but they refer to it as \"Medical School\" and claim he's becoming a doctor at 23, which others might mistake as an MD.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is correcting the misinformation in social situations, which is leading to some negative reactions from the parents. The author's intention is to acknowledge the actual achievement without the exaggeration. They aren't dismissing the accomplishment but want the truth to be known.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. Is it wrong to correct someone when they are spreading false information? If someone is intentionally misleading others, then pointing that out is justified. The parents are omitting important details that change the meaning of their statements. Chiropractic school is a different profession, and calling it \"Medical School\" could be seen as deceptive. The author is trying to set the record straight, which seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of social dynamics. The author might be overstepping if they are not invited to correct the parents. The parents might feel embarrassed or disrespected. But the author isn't doing this out of malice; they're trying to be honest about their son's actual achievements. The parents' reaction (glare, side eye) suggests they are sensitive to the correction, but that doesn't necessarily make the author in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the value of truth vs. politeness. While it's important to be truthful, sometimes social situations require tact. The author could choose to correct the parents in a private, non-confrontational way rather than in public. But the author's approach is to bring it up when they're present, which might be necessary if the parents are consistently misleading others.\n\nAlso, the parents' behavior might stem from a lack of understanding or pride in chiropractic as a profession. The author's correction could help validate the actual achievements of the son, which is positive. However, if the author's actions are causing discomfort, there's a balance to strike between honesty and kindness.\n\nIn summary, the author is trying to correct a factual inaccuracy, which is not inherently wrong. The parents are misrepresenting their son's education, so the author is right to point that out. The method might be a point of contention, but the intent is to be truthful and respectful to the son's actual accomplishment. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
