With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when the coworker's parents refer to their son's chiropractic school as \"medical school.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's son is in chiropractic college, but the parents and the coworker refer to it as medical school. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to negative reactions like glares. The author's reasoning is that the parents aren't proud of their son's actual accomplishment, hence the misrepresentation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Chiropractic school is different from medical school (MD), though both are challenging. 2) The parents are misrepresenting their son's education, possibly to impress others. 3) The author corrects them, leading to tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is justified in their actions. On one hand, the author is being honest and correcting a factual inaccuracy, which could be seen as right. On the other hand, correcting in social situations might be seen as rude or unnecessary, especially if the parents are trying to present their son's achievements in a certain light, even if it's a stretch.\n\nBut wait, the author emphasizes that they aren't dismissing the accomplishment. They acknowledge the hard work involved in chiropractic school. Their issue is with the misrepresentation. So, maybe the author isn't being arrogant but is pointing out a factual error. However, in social contexts, sometimes people use terms metaphorically or in a way that's not strictly accurate but is understood in context. For example, people might refer to various graduate programs as \"medical school\" colloquially, even if it's not technically correct. \n\nBut chiropractic school is a specific type of program, and calling it medical school is a factual mistake. Medical doctors (MDs) go to medical school, while chiropractors attend chiropractic colleges. So, the author is right in the technical sense. However, the parents might be using the term \"medical school\" in a more general sense, perhaps because both involve healthcare and rigorous education. The author's correction could be seen as pedantic, especially if the parents are using the term to highlight the son's academic success without intending to deceive.\n\nAnother angle is intent. The author's intention is to correct misinformation and encourage the parents to be proud of the actual accomplishment. However, the parents might feel embarrassed or defensive when corrected in front of others. Social interactions often involve avoiding embarrassment, so the author's direct correction might be seen as tactless, even if factually correct.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the parents are not proud of their son's actual field, hence the misrepresentation. If that's true, the author's correction is an attempt to address that underlying issue. But the method of correction in public could be problematic. There's a difference between correcting in a private conversation versus in a public social setting where it might cause discomfort.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often don't correct others' self-descriptions unless it's misleading in a harmful way. If the parents are not being deceptive but are using a term that's a bit off, the author's correction might be unnecessary. However, if the parents are actively misleading others (e.g., claiming their son is an MD in training, which he's not), then correction is more justified.\n\nThe line between being honest and being inconsiderate can be thin. The author's actions are technically correct but may be socially insensitive. The parents might not see the correction as helpful but as a public reprimand. Therefore, while the author isn't factually wrong, the method of correction could be seen as tactless, making them the asshole in the social context.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong factually, but their approach might be socially inappropriate. Since the question is about being an asshole, which relates more to social behavior than factual accuracy, the answer might lean towards the author being an asshole because their actions caused discomfort and were possibly unkind, even if well-intentioned.\n"
