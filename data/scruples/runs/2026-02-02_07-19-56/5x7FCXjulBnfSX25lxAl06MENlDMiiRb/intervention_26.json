With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author corrects their coworker and the coworker's parents when they refer to the son attending \"Medical School\" instead of Chiropractic college. The author feels that the parents are inflating the son's achievements and that they are correcting the misinformation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Chiropractic school is a legitimate program, but it's different from medical school (MD). The parents are using \"Medical School\" which could mislead others into thinking their son is on the path to becoming an MD, which is a different profession. The author is bringing up the correct information, which might make others feel embarrassed or defensive.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The coworker's family might have their own reasons for referring to it as medical school, maybe due to a lack of understanding of the difference or perhaps societal perceptions. However, from the author's perspective, correcting the record is about honesty and accuracy.\n\nBut, the author's actions are causing discomfort (glare, side eye), which might be unnecessary. The parents might genuinely believe that chiropractic is part of medical school, or they might be trying to present it in a more prestigious light. The author's motivation is to highlight the truth, but is that their place to do so in social situations?\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between correcting misinformation and respecting others' intentions. If the parents are intentionally misleading people, the author is right to correct them. But if they're just mistaken, the author's approach might be harsh. The author might be overstepping by making it a point in every social interaction, which could be seen as confrontational.\n\nAlso, the author's bias against chiropractic is mentioned as something they set aside, but maybe that bias still influences their judgment. However, they do acknowledge the accomplishment, which is a positive point.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's intent is to correct misinformation, which is noble, but the method might be causing unnecessary conflict. The key is whether the correction is warranted. Since chiropractic is not medical school, the author is technically correct, but the social handling is questionable. However, the author is not in the wrong for pointing out factual inaccuracies, even if it's done in a way that others find uncomfortable. But maybe the author should find a more tactful way to address it instead of correcting them every time. The main issue is whether the author has the right to correct them in social settings. If the parents are intentionally misleading, then the author is right. If they're just mistaken, maybe a more private correction would be better. Since the author is doing it publicly, causing discomfort, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But the underlying fact is correct. So, it's a bit of a grey area. The answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole, but there's a nuance. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the correction is factual and the parents are the ones being misleading.\n"
