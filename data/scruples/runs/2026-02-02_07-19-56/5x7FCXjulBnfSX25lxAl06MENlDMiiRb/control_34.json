With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author's coworker and his wife are telling people that their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to glares or side eye from the parents. The author's reasoning is that if the parents were truly proud, they would mention the actual program. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. Chiropractic college is different from medical school. Medical school leads to becoming a medical doctor (MD), whereas chiropractic college leads to a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC). The parents are technically being misleading by not clarifying this. The author is pointing out the inaccuracy, which could be seen as correcting a factual error. But maybe the parents are doing this for their own reasons, like wanting to impress others, since people might not be as familiar with chiropractic as they are with medical degrees. \n\nNow, the author's intention is to be honest and not let the parents present their son's achievements inaccurately. The coworker's family might feel that the author is being critical or not acknowledging their son's accomplishment by bringing this up in social settings. They might perceive the correction as embarrassing or undermining their pride. But the author isn't dismissing the accomplishment itself; they just want it to be accurately represented.\n\nI also need to think about the appropriateness of the author's actions. Is it okay to correct someone in a social setting about the technical title of their child's education? Some might argue that the author is being truthful and helping others understand the actual situation. Others might say that the author is prying or causing unnecessary embarrassment. \n\nAnother angle is the parents' pride. If they don't mention the chiropractic college, maybe they're trying to elevate their son's status, perhaps due to personal bias or societal perceptions of the profession. The author's correction might be challenging their right to present their son's achievements in a way they see fit, even if it's a bit of a stretch. But the author's point is valid in pointing out the factual inaccuracy. However, the way the author does it\u2014interjecting in the conversation\u2014could be considered rude or intrusive, especially if it's done to correct rather than to educate or support. \n\nSo, the author's action is based on honesty, but perhaps the approach is what's causing the issue. The parents might not want to be corrected in front of others, so the author's method of correction could be seen as tactless. On the other hand, if the author is simply stating the truth without malice, maybe it's justified. But the key here is the social context. In social situations, people often share what they're proud of, and the parents are choosing how to present their son's achievements. The author's correction might be undermining their right to do so, even if the information is technically incorrect.\n\nI should also consider if the author is overstepping. The parents are sharing information about their son, and the author is inserting themselves to correct it. This might not be the author's place, especially if the parents are fine with the misrepresentation. The author could be motivated by a desire for accuracy, but it's possible that they're being judgmental about the chiropractic profession, even if they say their bias isn't there. The parents might feel that their son's choice of profession is being criticized by the author's correction. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is technically correct in the factual sense, their approach might be causing unnecessary conflict. The parents have the right to express their pride in their own way, even if it's not perfectly accurate, unless it's being used to deceive others. The author's intent is to correct the record, but in social settings, people often prioritize politeness and not causing embarrassment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for interrupting the parents' pride in their son's achievements, even if the information isn't 100% precise.\n"
