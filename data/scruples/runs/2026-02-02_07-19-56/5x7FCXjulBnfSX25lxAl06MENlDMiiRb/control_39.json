With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker's parents when they refer to their son attending \"Medical School\" instead of Chiropractic college. The parents are misrepresenting their son's education, implying he's in an MD program and will be a doctor at 23. The author corrects this in social situations, which leads to negative reactions from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around correcting others' statements, especially in casual settings. Correcting someone can be seen as confrontational or rude, but there's a counterpoint about accuracy. The parents are actively misleading people by not disclosing the actual field of study. Chiropractic school is different from medical school, so the parents might be inflating their son's achievements, possibly due to a lack of understanding or a desire to present him in a more prestigious light.\n\nThe author's intent is to set the record straight, even if it causes discomfort. They acknowledge the accomplishment of attending chiropractic school, which shows they're not dismissing the effort. However, the parents might feel embarrassed or defensive when corrected, leading to side-eye or glares. The question is whether the author overstepped by correcting them in social settings.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest and factual. On the other hand, they might not be considering the parents' intentions or the potential reasons behind their statements. Maybe the parents are proud but using a term they think is more familiar, not intending to deceive. The author's corrections could be seen as pointing out a discrepancy without understanding the parents' perspective.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Is the author justified in correcting factual inaccuracies? 2) Are the parents being deceptive? 3) Is the author's method of correction appropriate?\n\nIn many cases, correcting others in social settings can be a gray area. If the parents are clearly lying or misleading, the author might be right to correct them. However, if the parents are just using a term that's technically incorrect but not malicious, the author's approach might be seen as overly critical. The line between being honest and being a jerk can be thin. The author's motivation is good, but the method and context matter. Since the parents are consistently misrepresenting the information, the author might not be in the wrong for pointing it out, especially if they're trying to be truthful. However, the social dynamics and the parents' possible feelings are also factors. It's a judgment call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since the parents are making a false claim.\n"
