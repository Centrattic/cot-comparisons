With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker's parents who refer to their son's chiropractic college as \"Medical School\" and claim he's a doctor at 23, which leads people to think he's in an MD program. The author corrects them every time, even if it causes some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The parents are misrepresenting their son's education. Chiropractic school is different from medical school, so calling it medical school is technically incorrect. The author is pointing out the factual inaccuracy, which could be seen as being honest or maybe overstepping.\n\nOn one hand, the author is right that the parents are being misleading. People might not understand the difference between a Doctor of Chiropractic and a Medical Doctor. The author's intention is to correct the misinformation, which is a valid concern because it's about accuracy.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should consider the parents' pride and how they feel. Perhaps they're proud of their son's achievements in chiropractic school but feel that the term \"chiropractor\" isn't respected enough, so they use \"medical school\" to gain more recognition. The author's corrections might be hurtful even if they're factually correct. \n\nBut then again, the parents are the ones making the false claims. The author isn't lying; they're correcting a misrepresentation. The parents might not be proud of their son's actual field, hence the exaggeration. The author is trying to highlight the real accomplishment without downplaying it.\n\nSo, the key question is whether correcting a factual inaccuracy in a social setting makes the author an asshole. If the parents are intentionally misleading others, the author is justified in pointing that out. However, if the author is doing it in a condescending or harsh way, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention the tone, but the parent's reaction is side eye and glares, which suggests the author is being met with resistance.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is being respectful. The author might be right to correct the misinformation but could be doing it in a way that's socially awkward or hurtful. However, the parents are the ones making the false claims, so the author isn't in the wrong for pointing that out. The author's intention is to be truthful and avoid others being misled.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are correcting a falsehood, even if it causes discomfort. The parents are the ones misrepresenting their son's education, so the author is justified in their actions.\n"
