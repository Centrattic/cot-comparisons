With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when the coworker says his son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic college. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the coworker's parents are presenting their son's education as medical school and even saying he'll become a doctor at 23. The author corrects them, pointing out the difference between chiropractic college and medical school. The author isn't dismissing the accomplishment, just the misrepresentation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong to do this. On one hand, correcting misinformation could be seen as helpful, especially if people are being misled. Medical schools and chiropractic colleges are different in terms of curriculum, recognition, and the profession. If others are under the impression that the son is an MD, that's a factual inaccuracy. The author might be trying to uphold truth in the conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents are trying to present their son's achievements in a more prestigious light. Chiropractic might not be as respected in some circles as medical doctors, so the parents might feel the need to inflate the status. The author's corrections might be embarrassing the parents, hence the side-eye. But does that make the author wrong? \n\nThe author isn't being malicious here; they're pointing out a fact. The parents are the ones choosing to misrepresent their son's education. The author's intention seems to be to correct the record rather than belittle the parents or their son. So, the author is not in the wrong for pointing out the factual error. The real issue is with the parents' misrepresentation. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it differently, like speaking privately instead of in public. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. Since the author is correcting a factual mistake without malice, they aren't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
