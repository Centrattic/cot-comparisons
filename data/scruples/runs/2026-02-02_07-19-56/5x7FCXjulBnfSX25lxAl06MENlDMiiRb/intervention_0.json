With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when they mention their son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The coworker and their parents are presenting their son's education as medical school, leading others to believe he's on a path to become a medical doctor. The author corrects them, pointing out it's chiropractic school instead. The parents react negatively with glares and side-eye. The author's reasoning is that the parents aren't proud of their son's actual field and are inflating it, so they feel it's their duty to correct the misinformation.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The possible answers are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI need to consider ethics and social norms here. Is it ethical to correct someone's misrepresentation, even if the underlying accomplishment is valid? Chiropractic school is a legitimate field, and while it's different from medical school, it's still a significant achievement. However, the parents are misrepresenting it, which could be seen as misleading others. \n\nThe author's intention is to point out the truth, not to belittle the accomplishment. The coworkers are omitting the correct information, possibly to elevate their son's status. The author's correction might be seen as honesty, but it could also come off as insensitivity or overstepping if done in a condescending way. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be overcorrecting if they have a bias against chiropractic. The original poster mentions setting aside their bias, but perhaps the correction is motivated by that bias, even if unintentionally. \n\nSocial dynamics matter too. Correcting someone in public might be awkward, and the parents' reaction could be due to feeling embarrassed or defensive. The author might not realize that the parents are trying to present their son's achievements in a more prestigious light, even if it's not accurate. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely trying to set the record straight without malice, it's a matter of factual correction. However, whether it's appropriate to do so in every social situation is debatable. The author might be causing unnecessary embarrassment to the parents, even if their intent is good. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the correction is well-meaning but done in a way that's insensitive, maybe. But if the parents are actively misleading others, the author has a right to correct the facts. However, the way they do it might matter. The key is intent and method. The original post doesn't mention the tone, so it's hard to judge. But given that the author is trying to highlight the truth and the parents are misrepresenting, the author's actions could be justified. But the frequency of correction (every time they mention it) might be excessive. \n\nAlso, the parents' pride could be genuine, even if they couch it in different terms. Maybe they don't see chiropractic as prestigious and are trying to present it as medical school to avoid stigma. The author's assumption that the parents aren't proud of the actual field might be incorrect. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer hinges on whether correcting every time is necessary and respectful. If the author is doing it to prevent misinformation, they might be justified. But if they're doing it to humiliate or correct for their own satisfaction, that's a problem. The scenario doesn't specify the tone, but the author's motivation is to set the record straight, not to mock. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the factual correction, even if the parents are uncomfortable. However, there's a nuance in how often and how it's done. But based on the information given, the author's intent is honest, so they're not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
