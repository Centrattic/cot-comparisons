With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when they refer to their son's education.\n\nThe coworker's son is in chiropractic school, but they call it medical school and claim he's a doctor. The author corrects them, leading to glare and side eye. The author's reasoning is that the parents should be proud of the actual accomplishment, not the inflated version. They think the parents aren't proud of chiropractic and so they mislead others.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for correcting them?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is correcting misinformation. Chiropractic school is different from medical school (MD). The coworkers are misrepresenting the son's education. The author's intention is to set the record straight. However, the parents might feel defensive or embarrassed when corrected. \n\nBut is correcting the truth wrong? Well, if the author is doing it in a respectful way, maybe not. However, the situation is social. The coworkers might be exaggerating for social status or other reasons. The author is bringing attention to the discrepancy, which could be seen as undermining the parents' pride, even if they're mistaken. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't dismissing the son's achievements but points out the inaccuracy. The parents might not want to admit they're proud of a different path, which could be a social stigma. \n\nThe key points are: the author is truthful but the correction might be causing social discomfort. Is it the author's place to correct them in every social situation? Maybe they're being overly concerned. Alternatively, they're being honest about the facts. \n\nSome people might argue that the author is right to correct the misinformation. Others might say that they should mind their own business, as the parents are proud of their son regardless of the specifics. The author's actions could be seen as prying or being unnecessarily confrontational, even if their intention is good. \n\nThe parents might not want to be corrected in front of others, leading to the negative reactions. So the author's approach might be causing more harm than good, even if the correction is accurate. \n\nI think the answer depends on the intent and method. If the author is doing it in a respectful way to clarify facts, maybe not. But if they're doing it to embarrass the parents, then yes. Since the author's reasoning is about pride and the parents' true feelings, it's possible they're overstepping. \n\nSo the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're being judgmental about the parents' pride and correcting them in social settings might not be appropriate. However, others might say the author is right to correct misinformation. The line between correcting facts and being a know-it-all is thin here. \n\nBut given the context, the author's actions are causing discomfort and the parents might just want to be proud of their child's achievements, even if others don't see the value. The author's correction could be seen as invalidating the parents' pride, hence making them the asshole. So answer A.\n"
