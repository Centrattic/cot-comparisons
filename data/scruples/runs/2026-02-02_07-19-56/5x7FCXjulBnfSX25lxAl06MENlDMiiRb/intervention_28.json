With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The author feels it's necessary to correct their coworker's parents when they refer to their son's chiropractic school as \"Medical School\" and claim he's a doctor. The author's reasoning is that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment, hence the misrepresentation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Chiropractic education does involve a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree, which is a doctoral degree, though different from an MD. So technically, the son is a doctor in his field, even if not a medical doctor. However, the parents are using the term \"Medical School,\" which might be misleading because MD and DC are different paths. The author is pointing out the inaccuracy, which could be seen as correcting misinformation.\n\nBut here's the catch: the parents are choosing to present the information in a certain way. Maybe they're highlighting the achievement of getting into a competitive program, regardless of the specific field. Or perhaps they're emphasizing the title \"Doctor\" to gain respect, which is a common practice. The author's intervention might be seen as undermining their pride, especially if the parents are genuinely proud of their son's accomplishment, even if they're using different terminology.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about the truth being presented. Misleading people by calling chiropractic school \"Medical School\" could be seen as deceptive, especially if others are under the impression that the son is an MD. The author is correcting this, which is a matter of honesty. However, the author might be overstepping by making it a personal issue about the parents not being proud of the actual accomplishment, which isn't for the author to judge.\n\nThe key question is whether the correction is necessary and respectful. If the author is doing it in a condescending or judgmental way, that's problematic. If they're just factually correcting the record, it's more about honesty. However, the parents might have their reasons for the terminology, and the author's assumption that the parents aren't proud is speculative. The author might be projecting their own biases, as they mention having a bias against chiropractic care but try to set that aside. Yet, they might still feel the need to correct others, which could be rooted in that bias.\n\nIn terms of social norms, correcting someone in a social setting can be seen as rude if not done tactfully. The parents might not see the need for correction, especially if they're using a term that's commonly understood in their circles. The author's actions could be causing unnecessary conflict and making the parents feel embarrassed. The parents' pride in their son's achievements might not be diminished by the specific terminology, but the author is imposing their own standards on how pride is expressed.\n\nSo, the author's intentions are good\u2014promoting honesty\u2014but the method and judgment about the parents' pride might be crossing a line. The parents are the ones making the statements, and the author's role here is to decide whether it's their place to correct them. Unless there's a professional or ethical obligation to do so (like in a formal setting where accuracy is crucial), in a social context, the author might be overstepping. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong for intervening in a personal matter where the parents' motivation isn't clear and for making assumptions about their feelings towards their son's education.\n"
