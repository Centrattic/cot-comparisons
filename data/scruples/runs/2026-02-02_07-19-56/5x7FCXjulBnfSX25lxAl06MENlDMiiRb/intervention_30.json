With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when the coworker says their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's family is stating their son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic school. The author corrects them, arguing that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment and are misrepresenting it. The author feels this is misleading others into thinking he's in an MD program, which is a different field. The coworker's family gets annoyed when the author corrects this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: is the author wrong to correct them? Let's consider the context. The author mentions they have a bias against chiropractic but acknowledge the hard work involved. However, they correct the family's statements, which the family finds irritating. \n\nNow, in terms of social norms, people often exaggerate or present things in a more favorable light. For example, someone might call a community college \"junior college\" or refer to their job in a certain way that's a bit of a stretch. But when it comes to professions like medical school vs. chiropractic, there's a clear distinction. Medical doctors (MDs) have a different education and license compared to chiropractors. So, if someone says their child is in \"Medical School\" when they're actually in chiropractic school, that's technically incorrect, even if the parent is proud of the accomplishment. \n\nThe author's intention is to correct the misinformation, which could be seen as noble, especially if others are misled. However, the coworker's family might feel that the author is undermining their son's achievements by pointing out the difference. The author's correction might come across as condescending or making the family's pride seem less valid. \n\nBut does that make the author the asshole? Well, the author is trying to set the record straight. If they're in a social setting and hear others misrepresenting a fact, it's reasonable to correct them, especially if the correction is factual and not malicious. However, the way the correction is delivered matters. If the author is doing it in a way that's snide or to show off their knowledge, that's different. The post mentions that the author is trying to highlight the actual accomplishment, not to belittle, but rather to correct the family's exaggeration. \n\nAnother angle is the author's own bias. They mention they have a bias against chiropractic but acknowledge the effort involved. So maybe the correction is partly driven by that bias, even if they try to mitigate it by praising the effort. However, the fact that they are correcting the factual inaccuracy (medical school vs. chiropractic) is separate from their personal bias. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, families often present their children's achievements in a way they feel reflects well. If the parents are uncomfortable with the actual field their son is in (chiropractic), they might misrepresent it. The author feels this is wrong and wants to correct it. \n\nIs correcting a factual inaccuracy the author's responsibility? It depends on the situation. If the author is in a position where they know the truth and others are being misled, correcting the record is appropriate. However, doing it in a way that's disruptive or causing the family discomfort might be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the truth. However, their approach might be seen as tactless if they're not being considerate of the family's feelings. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the family is the one making false claims, and the author is correcting them, it's more about the method rather than the act itself. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for correcting the misinformation. The coworker's family is the one misrepresenting their son's education. The author's intent is to set the record straight, not to humiliate or mock. Even if the author has a bias, the correction is factually accurate. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
