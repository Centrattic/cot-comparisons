With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author's coworker and their parents say their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to negative reactions from the parents. The author argues that the parents aren't proud of their son's actual path, hence the misrepresentation.\n\nFirst, I should consider the difference between Medical School (MD or DO) and Chiropractic school. Chiropractors are DCs, and while they require education and licensing, they are not medical doctors. The parents might be conflating the terms, which could be misleading. So, from a factual standpoint, the author is pointing out a misstatement. But is that their place?\n\nThe author's motivation is to present the son's actual accomplishments accurately. They acknowledge that the parents might be proud but are not accurately representing the son's field. However, correcting in social settings can be seen as intrusive or causing embarrassment. The parents might have their reasons for not specifying, maybe due to pride in the term \"doctor\" even if it's not an MD. Or perhaps they just don't realize the distinction others make.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author has the right to correct them. In some contexts, it's appropriate to clarify facts, especially if it's misleading others. However, it's also about social dynamics\u2014maybe the parents prefer to present the info that way, even if inaccurate. The author's actions could be seen as insensitivity to the parents' feelings or their intentions. On the other hand, the author isn't dismissing the son's achievement but wants the truth told.\n\nI need to weigh the intention versus the impact. The author's intention is to correct a factual inaccuracy, which is understandable. The impact is causing discomfort to the parents. But is the author overstepping by inserting themselves into correcting others' statements? If the parents are the ones presenting false info, then the author might be justified in clarifying. However, if the author is doing this in every social situation, it could be seen as being confrontational or not respecting the parents' choice to present the information a certain way.\n\nAnother angle: the parents might not realize that people distinguish between MDs and DCs. Or they might think the term \"doctor\" is equivalent. The author is pointing out that others might misunderstand, which is a valid concern. But is it the author's responsibility to correct every instance? Maybe it's better to address it privately rather than in public, to avoid embarrassment.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're correcting a factual misrepresentation. However, the method might be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the correction is necessary and respectful. Since the author is doing it in social settings, which can be awkward, but their intent is to prevent misinformation, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are intentionally misrepresenting their son's education, then the author isn't wrong to correct them. But if the parents are just using colloquial terms without realizing the difference, the author might be overstepping. The key is the parents' intent. If they're deliberately misleading to inflate their son's status, the author's correction is justified. If they're just mistaken, then it's a different scenario. The original post suggests the author thinks the parents are not proud of the actual field, hence the misrepresentation. So the author is trying to hold the parents accountable for that.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on the parents' intent. If they're actively misleading, the author is right. If they're just mistaken, the author might be overstepping. However, since the author is making a point about the parents not being proud of the actual accomplishment, the correction is a way to highlight that. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
