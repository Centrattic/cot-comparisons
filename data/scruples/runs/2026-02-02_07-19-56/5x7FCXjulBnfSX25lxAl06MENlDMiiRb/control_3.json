With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is the asshole (AITA). The situation is about a coworker's parents who refer to their son being in \"Medical School\" even though he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author corrects them every time they do this, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The coworker's parents are misrepresenting their son's education. The author feels that they're not proud of his actual accomplishment (chiropractic) and are inflating it to sound like a medical doctor (MD). The author corrects them in social settings, which upsets the parents. The author's intention is to highlight the real achievement and prevent others from getting the wrong impression.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author is correcting misinformation. They might believe that being truthful is important, especially if the parents are misleading others. The author isn't dismissing the accomplishment but feels the parents are not being accurate. This could be seen as standing up for truth and honesty.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have their reasons. Maybe they're trying to protect their son's feelings if there's stigma around chiropractic. Or perhaps they genuinely think chiropractic is part of medical school. The author's corrections might be embarrassing for the parents, leading to side-eye and glare. Publicly correcting others in social situations can be awkward and might come off as confrontational, even if well-intentioned.\n\nAlso, the author might be overstepping. While the parents are misrepresenting their son's education, the author's role in correcting them might not be their place. Unless there's a direct impact on the author's work or a need to correct the record for professional reasons, it's a personal family matter. The author might be prying or making the situation uncomfortable.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are proud of their son, just in a different way. They might value different things. The author assumes the parents aren't proud of chiropractic, but maybe they are. The parents might still want to present it as a medical path, even if it's not MD. The author's correction could be seen as judgmental, especially if they have a bias against chiropractic, as they mentioned putting that aside but still might subconsciously influence their actions.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the parent's misrepresentation is harmless and not causing actual harm, the author's intervention might be unnecessary. But if the author is correcting with the intent of honesty and preventing others from being misled, that's a valid point. However, the way they do it\u2014publicly correcting in social situations\u2014might be the issue. Maybe a private conversation would be better.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and the impact. The author's intent is to be truthful, but the impact is causing tension. However, the parents are the ones spreading misinformation. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the truth, but the method might be questionable. But if the author is the one who's being corrected, maybe they're not the asshole here. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are correcting misinformation. However, if the corrections are done in a harsh or public way without considering the parents' feelings, maybe A. But the scenario doesn't mention the tone. The author says they work the actual college into the conversation, which could be a more diplomatic approach. So maybe B.\n"
