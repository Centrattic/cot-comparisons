With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he says his son is in medical school, when he's actually in chiropractic college. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The coworker's parents consistently refer to their son as being in \"Medical School\" and say he'll be a doctor at 23. The author corrects them to mention it's chiropractic college. The parents react with side-eye or glares. The author thinks the parents aren't proud of their son's actual accomplishment and are inflating it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is correcting a factual inaccuracy. Chiropractic school is not medical school. Medical doctors (MDs) go to medical school, while chiropractors attend a different type of school. The parents are misrepresenting their son's education, which could lead others to believe he's on a different career path. The author's intention is to present the truth, and they acknowledge that chiropractic school is still a valid accomplishment.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents feel proud of their son's achievements in chiropractic school and use the term \"medical school\" colloquially or mistakenly. The author's corrections might be seen as insensitively pointing out a difference that others might not care about. Also, the parents might genuinely believe that their son's work in chiropractic is part of the medical field, so using the term \"medical school\" isn't malicious. The author's corrections could be causing unnecessary tension.\n\nAnother angle: The author is in a position to correct the record, especially if the misinformation is leading others to incorrect assumptions. The author isn't dismissing the accomplishment, just clarifying it. However, the parents might feel attacked or embarrassed when corrected in social settings, which can affect workplace relationships.\n\nIs it the author's place to correct their coworkers in every social situation? If the coworkers are intentionally misleading others, the author has a point. But if the parents are just mistaken or using a term incorrectly, the author's persistent corrections might be overstepping.\n\nAlso, the parents might not realize the difference is significant to others. The author's motivation is to be honest, but their method could be causing more harm than good. Maybe the author should handle it privately instead of publicly correcting them each time.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's a bit of a grey area. The author isn't wrong in pointing out the factual error, but the way they do it might be contributing to the tension. The parents' intent could be innocent, while the author's corrections might be perceived as judgmental. The key is whether the correction is necessary in every social setting. If the author is doing it to prevent misinformation, they're acting in good faith. But if they're doing it to shame the parents, they might be in the wrong. The original post doesn't provide enough context on the author's tone or intent beyond stating the fact, but the parents' reaction suggests that the corrections are unwelcome.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for correcting the facts, but their approach could be problematic. However, since the parents aren't necessarily doing anything malicious, the author's insistence on correcting every time might come off as rude. So, the answer could hinge on whether public corrections in social settings are appropriate here. If the author's corrections are done in a respectful manner, maybe they're justified. But if they're doing it to humiliate or make the parents feel bad, then they'd be the asshole.\n"
