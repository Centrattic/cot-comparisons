With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the provided scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting a coworker's parents who keep saying their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author does this correction in social situations, and the parents react negatively with side-eye or glares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The coworker's family is misrepresenting their son's education. Chiropractic school is a different field from medical school (MD). The author corrects them, but the parents might be embarrassed or feel that chiropractic isn't as prestigious. The author's intention is to highlight the actual achievement without bias, but their actions are causing tension.\n\nNow, the central question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is being honest and factual. They're not dismissing the accomplishment, just pointing out the difference between chiropractic and medical school. On the other hand, maybe the author isn't considering the parents' feelings or their reasons for the misrepresentation. Could there be a cultural or personal reason why they feel the need to present their son's education as medical school? Maybe they see it as more respected in their community, and the author's corrections are hurting their pride without understanding that context.\n\nAlso, social dynamics matter here. The author is correcting in public settings, which can be awkward. Even if the author is right factually, the manner of correction might be seen as rude. The parents might feel embarrassed when others find out, leading to the negative reactions. The author might be overstepping by not considering their feelings, even if the correction is technically accurate.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't dismissing the achievement. They're just pointing out the truth. However, the parents' choice to misrepresent could be a red flag. The author's motivation is good\u2014wanting to celebrate the actual accomplishments rather than the inflated version. Yet, the method of correction in public might be the issue. Maybe the author should have addressed it privately instead of in social situations where it's more embarrassing.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is compassion. The line between being truthful and being insensitive can be thin. The author might be on the right side of truth but using the wrong approach. So, while the author's intention is commendable, the method could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (they're being honest), but perhaps their approach could be improved. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not if their approach is optimal. Since the author is correcting a factual inaccuracy and not being malicious, they might not be the asshole. But if the parents have their reasons and the author isn't given a chance to understand, maybe it's a gray area. But based on the information given, the author's actions seem justified, albeit maybe tactless. So the answer would be B (No, they're not in the wrong).\n"
