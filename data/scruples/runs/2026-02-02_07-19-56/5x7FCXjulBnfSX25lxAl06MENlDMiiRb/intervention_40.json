With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is correcting their coworker when he refers to his son being in \"Medical School,\" even though the son is actually in Chiropractic college. The author feels that the parents are inflating their son's accomplishments by not mentioning the correct school and instead saying \"Medical School,\" leading others to assume an MD program. The author corrects this in social situations, which leads to negative reactions from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Is it appropriate to correct someone's personal information in a social setting? The parents might be proud of their son's achievements but perhaps feel that the term \"Medical School\" is more respected or socially perceived as higher status. The author might be motivated by a desire for accuracy and honesty, but does that justify interrupting the parents' narrative?\n\nChiropractic school is a legitimate path with its own challenges, as the author acknowledges. The parents might be emphasizing the positive aspects of their son's education without intending to deceive. However, the author feels that by not correcting this, people are misled. The key here is whether the parents' statements are deceptive or just a misstatement of facts.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, correcting someone in public can be seen as rude or confrontational, even if it's about factual inaccuracies. The author's actions might be causing discomfort for the parents, which could strain their relationship. On the other hand, the author might believe that honesty is more important than social harmony in this case.\n\nAnother angle is the intention behind the author's corrections. Are they genuinely trying to inform others, or are they making a point about the parents' lack of pride in their son's actual field? The latter could be seen as self-serving or judgmental. The parents might have their own reasons for the phrasing, such as cultural or personal pride, and the author's corrections might not consider that perspective.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here unless there's an intent to deceive for financial gain, which isn't the case. Ethically, it's a gray area. While factual accuracy is important, the social context and the potential impact on relationships need to be considered. The author's actions might be well-meaning but could be perceived as overstepping, especially if the parents are not intentionally lying but just using a term they associate with their son's education.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's motivations and the social implications are key factors. If the author is consistently correcting the parents in a way that embarrasses them, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the parents are actively misrepresenting their son's education, the author has a point. But since the parents are not using the term maliciously, the author might be in the wrong for publicly correcting them without a more private approach first."
