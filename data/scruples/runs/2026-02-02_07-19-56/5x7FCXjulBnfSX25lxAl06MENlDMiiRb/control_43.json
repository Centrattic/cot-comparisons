With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker's parents when they refer to their son's chiropractic school as medical school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The coworker's son is attending a chiropractic college, which is different from a medical school. Chiropractors do go through a specific educational path, but it's not the same as becoming an MD. The parents are representing his education as medical school and even saying he'll be a doctor at 23, which could mislead people into thinking he's in an MD program.\n\nThe author feels that the parents are inflating their son's accomplishments and that the parents aren't proud of the actual achievement. When the author corrects this, they get negative reactions from the parents. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nNow, looking at the perspectives. On one hand, the author is pointing out the truth to prevent misinformation. Chiropractic and medical schools are different, and the parents' statements could lead to misunderstandings about the son's qualifications. The author isn't belittling the accomplishment but is correcting a factual inaccuracy.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel that they're emphasizing their son's educational journey positively, even if the terminology is off. They might also feel the author is being overly critical or that the author's corrections are causing embarrassment.\n\nBut the key here is the intent. The author states they have no issue with chiropractic care in general and acknowledge the son's hard work. Their correction is about factual accuracy, not dismissing the profession. The parents' choice to misrepresent their son's education could be seen as misleading, and the author is trying to set the record straight.\n\nIn terms of social situations, people often correct others when factual inaccuracies are made, especially if it affects how others perceive someone. The author isn't making a judgment about the profession but is correcting a misrepresentation. The parents' reactions (glare, side eye) suggest they might be defensive or prefer to present their son's achievements in a more prestigious light, which the author finds disingenuous.\n\nIn such cases, the line between being honest and being an asshole can be thin. However, the author's intentions seem to be in good faith, aiming for factual correctness rather than mockery. The parents' behavior of omitting the actual school name and exaggerating the title might be the root issue here.\n\nSo, while the parents might be the ones misrepresenting the facts, the author's actions are about correcting that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the truth, even if it's uncomfortable for the parents.\n"
