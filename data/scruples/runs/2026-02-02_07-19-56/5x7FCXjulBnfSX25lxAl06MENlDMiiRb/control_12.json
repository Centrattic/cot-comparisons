With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for correcting their coworker's parents when they mention their son is in \"Medical School\" instead of Chiropractic school. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker's parents are stating their son is in medical school, which is a different field than chiropractic. The author feels that the parents are misrepresenting their son's achievements by not correcting this and even exaggerating that he'll be a doctor at 23, one of the youngest. The author interjects in social situations to clarify the actual program, leading to negative reactions from the parents.\n\nNow, the key points here are the parents' actions versus the author's response. The parents are choosing to present their son's education in a way that might not be accurate. The author's issue is that they believe the parents aren't proud of their son's actual accomplishment in chiropractic, hence the misrepresentation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for correcting them? Well, the author's intention is to be honest about the son's actual education. But the parents might be doing this for various reasons\u2014maybe societal stigma against chiropractic, or they genuinely don't understand the difference between MDs and DCs. The author is pointing out the factual inaccuracy, but the parents might feel that their pride is valid regardless of the field. \n\nLegally, there's no issue here. Socially, it's about tact. The author is correcting a factual error, but doing so in social situations might come off as confrontational. The parents could be embarrassed or defensive, hence the glares. However, the author's motivation isn't to mock but to highlight the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest, which is generally a positive trait. They're not belittling the son's achievements but pointing out the discrepancy between what's being said and the reality. The problem is whether the author overstepped by repeatedly correcting them in social settings, which might be seen as unkind or meddlesome. \n\nBut the parents are the ones misrepresenting the facts. The author might not be in the wrong because they're bringing attention to the truth. However, the method of correction could be considered tactless. Yet, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their approach is the best. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't the asshole for wanting to correct misinformation, even if it's uncomfortable. They're advocating for honesty versus the parents' possible pride-driven misrepresentation. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
