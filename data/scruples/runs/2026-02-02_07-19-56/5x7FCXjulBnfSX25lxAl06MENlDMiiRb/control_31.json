With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he says his son is in medical school, but he's actually in chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker and his parents are saying their son is in medical school and will be a doctor at 23, which people might assume is an MD. The author corrects them, pointing out it's chiropractic school. The coworker's parents react negatively, giving side-eye or glares. The author's intention is to highlight the actual accomplishment and pride in the real achievement.\n\nNow, the key points here. Are the parents misleading people by not mentioning it's chiropractic? Chiropractors are indeed doctors (DCs), but the public often confuses them with MDs. The parents might be inflating the prestige, but chiropractic is a legitimate field requiring education and work. The author is trying to set the record straight, which could be seen as honest or nosy.\n\nLegally, there's no law against someone misrepresenting their child's education in casual conversation unless it's for fraudulent purposes. Ethically, it's more about intent. The parents might feel they want to present their son's achievements in a more respected light, given societal biases. The author corrects them, possibly out of a sense of integrity, but maybe being too direct in social settings.\n\nIs the author wrong? If they're correcting factual inaccuracies, they have a point. However, the way they do it might be considered intrusive or causing embarrassment. The parents might not want the truth to be known because of stigma or their own biases. The author's motivation is valid, but the method and context matter. In social situations, it's about respecting others' preferences unless there's harm involved.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to correct misinformation, but the approach could be seen as overstepping. However, the parents' actions might be the issue. The author's correction is fact-based, which isn't wrong, but the social dynamics complicate it. The main question is whether the author's actions were justified. Since they're pointing out a factual error and encouraging pride in the real accomplishment, they might not be wrong. But if the correction is causing distress without a clear reason, maybe they are. The line is thin here.\n"
