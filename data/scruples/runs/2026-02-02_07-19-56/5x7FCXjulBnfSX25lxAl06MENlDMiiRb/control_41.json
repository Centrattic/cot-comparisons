With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he says his son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker and his family are misrepresenting the son's education. The author corrects them, leading to negative reactions like glares. The author believes the family isn't proud of the son's actual accomplishment in chiropractic school, hence the misrepresentation.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author's intention is to set the record straight. They acknowledge the accomplishment but feel the family is misleading others. The coworker's family might be doing this to elevate their son's status, maybe due to societal perceptions or their own biases against chiropractic vs. medical school.\n\nIs correcting someone in a social setting about a factual inaccuracy the author's responsibility? Some might say it's being honest, others might see it as overstepping. The key here is the motivation and the impact. The author isn't belittling the chiropractic field but is pointing out the factual error. The family's reaction suggests they're uncomfortable with the correction, possibly because they feel embarrassed or defensive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't lying, but social situations sometimes allow for some embellishment. However, the family's misrepresentation could be misleading others, which the author is trying to prevent. The author's correction is factual but might come off as confrontational. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is honest and the information is accurate, then they aren't wrong for correcting a falsehood. However, if the correction is done in a way that's not respectful, maybe. But the author's tone seems to be one of trying to highlight pride in the actual achievement, not mockery.\n\nAnother angle: the family's reasons for misrepresenting. If they feel chiropractic isn't respected, maybe they're trying to gain validation. The author, by correcting them, might be challenging that. But the author's stance is that the family isn't proud of the actual accomplishment, which is a judgment. However, the author's main point is about honesty in social interactions. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (Not the Asshole) because the author is correcting a factual inaccuracy without malice, aiming to honor the true accomplishment. The family's actions involve misrepresentation, so the author isn't wrong for pointing that out.\n"
