With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker's parents who are claiming their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author of the post corrects them in social situations, which leads to negative reactions from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents are misrepresenting their son's education. Medical school typically leads to an MD (Doctor of Medicine), while chiropractic college leads to a DC (Doctor of Chiropractic). These are different professions. The parents might be doing this because they feel chiropractor isn't as respected, maybe due to societal perceptions or their own biases. The author corrects them, arguing that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment and are misrepresenting it. The author's intention is to highlight the real achievement, but the parents view it as embarrassing or correcting them.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're being honest and pointing out factual inaccuracies. The son's achievements in chiropractic school are real and should be celebrated, but the parents are misrepresenting them. The author's corrections might be seen as necessary to avoid misleading others. However, the parents might have their reasons, such as feeling that chiropractic isn't respected enough, so they inflate the title to get recognition for their child's hard work.\n\nIs it the author's place to correct them every time? The author might be overstepping if the corrections are causing discomfort without a good reason. But if the parents are actively misleading others, the author could have a point in clarifying the facts. However, the author's approach might be socially awkward or unnecessary. Maybe a more tactful approach would be better, like not correcting in public or offering a more diplomatic way to explain the difference without judgment.\n\nThe author states they're not dismissing the accomplishment but want the parents to be proud of the real thing. However, by correcting, they might be invalidating the parents' feelings or their reasons for misrepresentation. The parents might feel that the author is making a judgment about their son's career choice, even if they claim not to.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between honesty and respecting others' intentions. If the parents are misrepresenting to gain social respect, the author's correction could be seen as a public correction, which can be seen as rude. On the other hand, if the author is trying to correct misinformation, maybe they have a valid point. But the parents have the right to be proud of their child's achievements as they see fit, even if they choose to represent it differently for personal reasons.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's intentions are noble, but their approach might be inconsiderate. The parents might have their own reasons, and the author could be overstepping by constantly correcting them. The line between being honest and being an asshole here is thin. The answer hinges on whether the correction is necessary and how it's delivered. If the author is causing unnecessary conflict over a matter that the parents are choosing to handle differently, they might be the asshole. However, if the misrepresentation is significant and the author is just stating facts without malice, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nIn the end, the key factors are the impact on the parents, the context of the corrections, and whether the author is being respectful. The parents might not want the truth to be revealed, and the author's insistence could be causing harm to their relationships. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong if their corrections are causing more harm than good.\n"
