With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The author's coworker's son is in chiropractic college, but the parents and son refer to it as \"medical school\" and say he'll be a \"practicing doctor at 23.\" The author corrects them whenever possible, which leads to some negative reactions from the parents. The author feels that the parents aren't proud of their son's actual accomplishment and are instead embellishing it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. Chiropractic care is a legitimate profession, even if the author has some bias against it. The parents might be proud of their son's achievement but are using terms that could be misleading. The key issue here is whether it's appropriate to correct them in social settings. \n\nOn one hand, lying or misleading others is generally wrong. If the parents are intentionally misrepresenting their son's education, that's dishonest. The author is pointing out the truth, which could prevent others from being misled. However, the author's motivation is important. Are they correcting out of a sense of honesty, or are they trying to make a point about the value of chiropractic over medical degrees? The author mentions they set aside their bias, so maybe it's the former. \n\nBut then, is it the author's place to correct them every time in social situations? This could be seen as public shaming, especially if the author is doing it in front of others. The parents might feel embarrassed or that their pride is being undermined. Even if they're not being truthful, the author's method of correction might be harsh. \n\nAnother angle: the parents might not realize the distinction is important. They could be using \"medical school\" loosely because chiropractic school is in the medical field. However, technically, they are different. The son does become a doctor (DC), but it's a different degree from an MD. So the parents' statements are factually incorrect. \n\nThe author's intention is to highlight that the parents should be proud of the actual achievement, not a misrepresented one. The parents might feel that downplaying the chiropractic aspect is due to societal stigma against the profession. If that's the case, maybe they're trying to protect their son's reputation. \n\nSo, the question is whether correcting them every time is the right approach. The author is being honest, but maybe they should have discussed it privately with the parents first instead of publicly correcting them. Public corrections in social settings can be seen as confrontational, even if the intent is good. \n\nAlso, the author says they do this \"in every social situation,\" which could be overstepping. It might not be their place to police how the parents present their child's achievements. The parents have the right to be proud of their child's accomplishments, even if they describe them differently. As long as the son is achieving his goals, the parents' pride is valid, regardless of the terminology used. \n\nOn the other hand, if the parents are actively lying, the author might feel it's their duty to correct the misinformation. But the line between correcting a factual error and being an asshole can be thin. The author's actions are causing discomfort, which could indicate that they are overstepping. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The parents might have their reasons, and the author's corrections, while well-intentioned, might be causing unnecessary conflict. So, the author could be seen as not the asshole because they're trying to be honest, but their approach might be the issue. However, in the context of the question, the options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not wrong) because the author is pointing out a factual inaccuracy. However, the method of correction could be improved. But since the question is about being an asshole, if the author's intent is to set the record straight and they're not being malicious, they might not be the asshole. The parents might be the ones misrepresenting things, so the author isn't wrong in correcting them. However, the social context and the reaction (side eye, glares) suggest that the author's approach is causing discomfort, which could tip it towards them being in the wrong. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, if the parents are indeed lying, the author isn't the asshole. But if the parents are just using a colloquial term and the author is being overly strict, then the author might be wrong. The line between factual correction and being pedantic is important here. Since the author mentions they set aside their bias, it's more about factual accuracy. So the author is trying to do the right thing. The parents might be the ones in the wrong for misrepresentation, so the author isn't the asshole. Therefore, answer B.\n"
