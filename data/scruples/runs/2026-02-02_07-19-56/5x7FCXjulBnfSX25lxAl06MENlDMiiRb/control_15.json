With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when the coworker mentions their son is in \"Medical School,\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker and his family present the son's education as Medical School, implying he's becoming an MD, which is a different profession from Chiropractic. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to negative reactions like glares. The author's reasoning is that they're being honest about the son's actual achievements and proud of the real accomplishment, but the parents might be embarrassed or trying to inflate the son's status.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: correcting others in social settings, the parents' intent to mislead, and whether the author's corrections are justified.\n\nChiropractic colleges do require a bachelor's degree, prerequisites similar to medical schools, and they're accredited programs. So, the son's achievement is real, even if different from MD. The parents might be conflating \"Doctor\" titles, which can be a point of contention. However, the parents are not lying in the strictest sense if they say \"Medical School,\" but technically, Chiropractic is a separate field. However, the term \"Medical School\" is often associated with MD/DO programs. So, the parents might be misleading others by not specifying the difference, which leads people to assume their son is in an MD program.\n\nThe author's correction is based on the belief that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment, hence the need to inflate it. The author is trying to set the record straight and encourage pride in the real achievement. But does that justify interrupting social conversations and causing embarrassment to the parents?\n\nHere, the line between honesty and politeness is thin. While the author has a valid point about the distinction between Chiropractic and Medical schools, correcting in the middle of social interactions might be seen as overstepping. People might feel that it's not the author's place to correct others unless it's a factual error with significant implications. Also, the parents might have their own reasons for presenting the information the way they do, maybe to avoid stigma or for personal reasons, even if it's technically inaccurate.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, interrupting to correct someone can come across as confrontational, even if the intention is to be truthful. The author might be seen as being overly critical of the parents' choices without understanding their perspective. However, the author is also being honest, which is a positive trait. The question is whether the correction is necessary in every social situation and if the method is appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' pride. If they're not proud of the son's real accomplishment, maybe due to societal stigma against Chiropractic, the author is trying to validate the son's achievement. But the author's approach might be causing more harm than good by alienating the parents instead of supporting them.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are good\u2014they want to highlight the son's real achievements and avoid misinformation. However, the method of correcting in social settings, especially if it's causing discomfort, might be the issue. It's possible that the author is in the right to correct factual inaccuracies, but the way they do it could be seen as tactless. However, if the parents are intentionally misleading others, the author might have a valid point in correcting them. The balance between honesty and social grace is tricky here, and without more context on the parents' motivations, it's hard to say definitively. But generally, correcting someone in a public setting without knowing their reasons can be seen as impolite, even if technically correct.\n"
