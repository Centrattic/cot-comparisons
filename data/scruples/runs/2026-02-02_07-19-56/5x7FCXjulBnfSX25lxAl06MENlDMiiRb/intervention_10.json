With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting a co-worker who's misrepresenting his son's education as medical school when he's actually in chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The coworker's family is stating their son is in medical school, leading others to believe he's on the path to becoming an MD. The author steps in to correct this, which leads to some negative reactions from the parents. The author argues that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment and are inflating it. They feel the family is being dishonest.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author is correcting a factual inaccuracy. Medical school and chiropractic school are different in terms of curriculum, accreditation, and the resulting profession. The parents might be misrepresenting it for social status or misunderstanding the distinction. The author is pointing out the truth, which could be seen as honest or as needlessly calling out a minor issue.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents are proud of their son's achievements in chiropractic school but feel the term \"chiropractic\" is less respected, so they use \"medical school\" to sound more prestigious. The author's correction might come off as judgmental or undermining their son's accomplishment, even if the author isn't dismissing the effort involved.\n\nIs it the author's place to correct every time? In social settings, people sometimes exaggerate for various reasons. If the coworker and his wife are intentionally misleading others, then the author might be right to correct them. However, if the parents are just using a common but inaccurate term (though that's unlikely, since \"chiropractic college\" is a specific term), the author might be overstepping.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. They mention their own bias against chiropractic but acknowledge the effort required. So their correction might be partly driven by their personal views, even if they're trying to be fair. That could color their judgment.\n\nAlso, the way the correction is delivered matters. If it's done in a condescending or public way, it might be more offensive. The author says they \"work what kind of college he is really attending into the conversation,\" which could be seen as subtly correcting others, not directly confronting the parents. But the parents' reactions (glare, side eye) suggest they feel disrespected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether the correction is justified. If the parents are intentionally misrepresenting, the author is correct. If it's a harmless misunderstanding, the author is being an asshole. But the parents might genuinely believe that chiropractic is part of medical school, which isn't true. However, since they are explicitly stating \"medical school,\" that's a deliberate misrepresentation.\n\nSo, from an objective standpoint, the author is right to correct the factual error. However, the social context complicates things. The parents might feel embarrassed or defensive. But the author's stance is that the parents aren't proud of the actual achievement, which is a judgment call. The author's own admission of a bias adds a layer where their correction might be influenced by personal views.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for correcting a factual inaccuracy, even if their approach or motivations are questionable. The parents are the ones misrepresenting the information. However, the author could consider the delivery method to avoid causing offense. But in terms of right or wrong, the author is justified.\n"
