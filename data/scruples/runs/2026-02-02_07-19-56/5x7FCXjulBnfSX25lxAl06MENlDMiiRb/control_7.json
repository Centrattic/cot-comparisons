With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when they mention their son is in medical school, when actually he's in chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's family is saying the son is in medical school, implying he's on track to be an MD. The author corrects this, pointing out it's chiropractic school instead. The author's reasoning is that the family is inflating the accomplishment, maybe not proud of the actual field, and they want to present the truth.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break down the factors. Chiropractic school is a legitimate field that requires education and training. It's a different path from MDs. However, there might be societal perceptions where some people equate \"doctor\" with MDs, leading to misunderstandings. The family might be trying to present their son's path in a more favorable light, perhaps due to their own biases or societal pressures.\n\nThe author's intention is to correct the misinformation, which is understandable. But the method is to interject in social situations, leading to tension. The family's actions could be seen as misleading if they're not correcting the misconception. But is it the author's place to step in?\n\nConsider respect for privacy and family dynamics. The author isn't their son, so maybe they shouldn't be the one to correct it. However, the author feels that the family isn't proud of the actual accomplishment and is misrepresenting it. The line here is between correcting misinformation and respecting the family's choice to present their story a certain way.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they are setting aside their own bias against chiropractic. That's a good point, as it shows they're not just correcting out of personal dislike but concern for accuracy. However, the family's pride in their son's actual achievements is valid, regardless of the field.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between being truthful and being tactful. The author is being truthful but might not be considering the family's motivations. They could be trying to avoid stigma around chiropractic, which is a real issue in some circles. By correcting them, the author could be causing the family embarrassment or discomfort.\n\nThe key here is whether the correction is warranted. If the family is misrepresenting the son's education for personal gain or deception, then the author has a right to correct. But if it's just a social exaggeration without malice, the author's intervention might be overstepping. The answer depends on the context of the corrections\u2014were they done respectfully, or is the author being confrontational?\n\nSince the author is facing side-eye, it suggests the corrections are unwelcome. The author might not be considering that the family's approach is their choice, even if they are technically incorrect. The line between honesty and respect is thin here. It's possible that the author is right in wanting to correct misinformation but wrong in the manner or frequency, leading to being an asshole.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are good, but the execution might be problematic. The answer could be a nuanced B, not in the wrong, but needing to consider the family's perspective and how to address it respectfully.\n"
