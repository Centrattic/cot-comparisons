With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's coworker and his wife keep saying their son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to negative reactions like glares or side-eye. The author believes the parents aren't proud of their son's actual accomplishment and that they're inflating it by misrepresenting the program.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of correcting others in social settings. On one hand, the author thinks it's important to be truthful and accurate. Chiropractic school is different from medical school (MD), so there's a factual discrepancy here. The parents might be misleading others by not specifying, which could be seen as dishonest or trying to appear more accomplished. The author's intention is to correct the record, which could be seen as doing the right thing by providing accurate information.\n\nOn the other hand, social interactions often require tact and respect. If the parents don't want to correct their son's program, maybe there's a reason\u2014perhaps they're proud of the accomplishment in their own way, even if it's a different field. The author's corrections might come across as condescending or judgmental, especially if the parents are trying to be supportive of their son's goals. The author's actions could be perceived as undermining the parents' pride or making them feel embarrassed. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for the author's own bias against chiropractic care. The user mentioned that the author has a personal bias but is trying to set it aside. However, even if the author is trying to be neutral, the act of correcting might still reflect an implicit judgment. The parents might not see the distinction as negatively as the author does, especially if they value their son's specific career path. \n\nAlso, the frequency of the corrections matters. If the author is bringing this up in every social situation, it might be seen as overstepping. The parents might prefer not to correct others for various reasons\u2014maybe they're tired of explaining, or they believe the distinction isn't important. The author's insistence on correcting could be causing unnecessary conflict in social settings, which is generally frowned upon unless it's a matter of serious consequence.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is the asshole (ITA), it's about whether their actions are unkind or unnecessarily harsh. The author's motivation is to be truthful, but the method might be problematic. The parents are still proud of their son's achievements, just in a different way. The author's corrections might not be necessary and could be harming social harmony. So, while the author's intent is good, the approach could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean toward A (the author is in the wrong) because correcting in a way that's causing discomfort without a strong justification could be seen as unnecessary. However, some might argue that the author isn't wrong for pointing out the truth. But given the social context and the parents' reactions, it's more about tact versus truth. The key is that the author isn't the one doing the lying; it's the parents. But the author's role in exposing that lie in a social setting might be the issue.\n"
