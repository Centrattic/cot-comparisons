With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting a coworker's parents who consistently refer to their son's chiropractic school as \"Medical School\" and mention he'll be a doctor at 23.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is correcting the parents' misrepresentation. Chiropractors do earn a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree, so calling them \"Medical Doctors\" (MDs) is technically incorrect. The parents are misleading others by not specifying the type of school and implying their son is in MD programs. The author brings up the actual facts in social situations, which upsets the parents.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nConsiderations: The author is factually correcting misinformation. The parents might be proud but are misrepresenting their son's achievements, which could be seen as deceptive. The author's intention is to correct the record, not belittle the accomplishment. However, public correction can be awkward and might come off as confrontational, even if well-intentioned.\n\nOn one hand, the author is right to point out the factual error, especially since people might misunderstand the son's profession. On the other hand, the author's approach might be causing discomfort for the parents, who might feel embarrassed or defensive. The author could be seen as overstepping by repeatedly correcting them in social settings, especially if the parents are proud of their son regardless of the mislabeling. However, the parents' choice to misrepresent the son's education could be a point of contention.\n\nAnother angle: The author is not dismissing the son's achievements, acknowledges the effort, but is concerned about the truth. The parents might have their own reasons for not specifying, perhaps due to stigma or lack of understanding about chiropractic vs. medical schools. The author's corrections are based on honesty, but the method might be tactless.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and the impact. If the author's corrections are factual and not meant to undermine, but the parents are in denial or defensive, the author might not be the asshole. However, if the corrections are causing unnecessary conflict without a good approach, maybe the author is being too direct. But given the parents are misrepresenting facts, the author's stance is reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're correcting a factual misrepresentation, even if the method is awkward. The parents are the ones being deceptive, so the author is justified in pointing out the truth.\n"
