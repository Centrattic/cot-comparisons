With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author did something wrong by correcting their coworker when he mentions his son is in \"Medical School\" instead of Chiropractic college. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's son is attending a chiropractic college, but the family refers to it as medical school. The author corrects this in social situations, which leads to negative reactions like glares. The author believes the parents aren't proud of their son's actual accomplishment and are inflating it by misrepresenting the program.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and social norms. Chiropractic school is different from medical school (MD programs). Chiropractors do require a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree, which is a professional doctoral program, but it's not the same as an MD. So technically, calling a chiropractic program \"medical school\" could be misleading because people might assume it's an MD program. However, chiropractors are indeed called \"Doctor\" so there's some validity to the parents' statement in terms of the title.\n\nThe author's problem is that the family is not being accurate about the type of education their son is pursuing. The author feels it's important to clarify this, even though they acknowledge the accomplishment of getting into chiropractic college. They argue that the parents aren't proud of their son's actual path, hence the need to misrepresent it.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for correcting them? Well, in social situations, sometimes people might exaggerate or use terms differently. If the parents are using \"medical school\" incorrectly, the author has a point in wanting to correct the factual inaccuracy. However, the way the author does it might be causing discomfort. Socially, people might not appreciate being corrected publicly, even if the correction is factual. It could be seen as rude to interrupt a family's pride in their son, even if the parent's statements are technically misleading.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely concerned about the misrepresentation and the potential for others to have incorrect assumptions, there might be a valid reason to clarify. But the approach is important. Instead of directly correcting in the moment, maybe a more diplomatic approach could be better. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the best approach.\n\nThe parents might feel that the author is undermining their son's achievements by pointing out the difference between chiropractic and medical school, especially since both are respected professions in their own right. The author is right that they're different, but the parents might see the title \"Doctor\" as sufficient and not want to diminish their son's accomplishment by specifying the field.\n\nSo, the author's intention is to correct the misrepresentation, but the parents might perceive it as belittling their son's success. The line between being honest and being a jerk can be thin here. If the author is doing it in a confrontational way, that could be the issue. However, if the author is gently correcting the facts without mockery, maybe it's justified.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between factual accuracy and social sensitivity. The author isn't wrong for wanting the truth to be known, but the method of correction might be causing the problem. However, considering the parents' perspective, the author might be overstepping by repeatedly pointing out the discrepancy, especially if it's causing tension. So the answer might depend on the nuance of how the correction is delivered. But given the information, the parents might not be in the right for misrepresenting the program, but the author's approach could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the manner in which they address the issue.\n"
