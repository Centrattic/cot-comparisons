With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a co-worker who is in chiropractic school, but the co-worker and their parents refer to it as \"medical school.\" The author corrects them in social situations, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is correcting the co-worker's parents about the misrepresentation of their son's education. The parents are using terms that could mislead others into thinking their son is in an MD program, which is different from chiropractic school. The author's intention is to highlight the actual accomplishment without bias, but the parents seem to be inflating their son's status.\n\nNow, why would the author be right? Chiropractic school and medical school are distinct. Chiropractors earn a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree, not an MD. The parents are misrepresenting their son's achievements, which the author is trying to correct. The author isn't dismissing the accomplishment but points out the factual inaccuracy. The parents' actions might stem from a desire for social status, which the author is challenging by emphasizing truth over perceived prestige.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is overstepping. They could be causing embarrassment or conflict by correcting in public. However, the author argues that they're being honest and that the parents aren't proud of the actual achievement if they're hiding it. The line between correcting misinformation and being a jerk is thin here. But since the author isn't belittling, just fact-checking, their intent seems genuine.\n\nAlso, the parents' behavior might be seen as deceptive. If they're presenting their son as going to medical school when he's not, the author has a right to correct that. The author isn't attacking the profession but the misrepresentation. So, the author isn't the asshole; they're pointing out the truth. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
