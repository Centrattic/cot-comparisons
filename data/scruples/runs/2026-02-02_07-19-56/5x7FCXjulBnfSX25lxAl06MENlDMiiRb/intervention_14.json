With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker whose son is in chiropractic school, but the parents refer to him as being in \"Medical School\" and say he'll be a doctor at 23. The author feels they need to correct this every time, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The coworker's family is misrepresenting their son's education. The author corrects them, leading to glares from the parents. The author's reasoning is that the family isn't proud of the son's actual achievement in chiropractic school, so they inflate it. The author believes the parents should be proud of the real accomplishment and that the misrepresentation is misleading others.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nSo, to evaluate, I need to consider if correcting someone's factual misrepresentation is the author's responsibility. Chiropractic school is a legitimate field, but it's different from medical school (MD). The parents are technically misleading others by not clarifying the distinction. The author is pointing out the factual error, which could be seen as honest and accurate, but the parents might feel embarrassed or defensive.\n\nIs the author overstepping by correcting them in social situations? The author's intention is to highlight the real achievement, but the parents might have their own reasons for not wanting to disclose the field, maybe due to stigma or personal preference. The author mentions their own bias against chiropractic care but still acknowledges the work involved. That shows they're not dismissing the accomplishment but are focused on the truth.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, correcting someone's misrepresentation could be seen as tactless. However, if the parents are misrepresenting facts, the author might feel a duty to correct them. Alternatively, it's possible the parents are just using a colloquial term without intending deception, and the author is overreacting.\n\nThe key is whether the author's actions are justified. The author isn't just correcting for their own knowledge but is actively inserting this information into conversations, which might be intrusive. The parents might have their own reasons for presenting the information differently, and the author's corrections could be causing unnecessary conflict.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, being \"the asshole\" often relates to being inconsiderate or causing harm without a good reason. If the author's corrections are causing discomfort and the parents have legitimate reasons for their approach, the author might be in the wrong. However, if the author is genuinely trying to prevent misinformation, they might be justified.\n\nBut given that the author mentions their own bias, maybe they are projecting. Also, chiropractic doctors are called \"Dr.\" which might contribute to the confusion. The parents might not realize the extent of the misperception. The author's role in correcting is a personal choice, and in social settings, people might prefer to let others present their own stories without correction unless it's harmful.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong because they are pointing out a factual inaccuracy. However, the manner in which they do it might be tactless. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the tactfulness. Since the parents are misrepresenting facts, the author's correction is about truth, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the author is overstepping by inserting themselves into the social dynamics. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, in AITA, if someone is correcting a misrepresentation, they might be justified. So leaning towards B.\n"
