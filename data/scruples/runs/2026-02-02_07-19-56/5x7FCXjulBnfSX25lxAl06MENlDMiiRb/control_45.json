With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he says his son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic college.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker's parents are telling people their son is in medical school, implying he's on track to be a doctor (MD), but he's actually in chiropractic school. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to negative reactions like glares. The author believes the parents aren't proud of their son's actual achievement and are inflating it. The question is whether the author is the asshole (ITA) or not.\n\nSo, considering the context: The parents are misrepresenting their son's education. Chiropractors are doctors (DCs), but they're not medical doctors (MDs). So when they say \"medical school\" and \"practicing doctor at 23,\" that's technically incorrect. The parents might be doing this to sound more impressive, but it's a misrepresentation of their son's actual field.\n\nThe author is correcting them, which could be seen as being honest or as being judgmental. The author mentions they set aside their bias against chiropractic to focus on the accomplishment, so they're not dismissing the son's success. They feel that the parents should be proud of the actual achievement and not the exaggerated version.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are the ones making the false claims. The author is pointing out the facts. However, the author's method of correction in social situations might be seen as public shaming or causing embarrassment. The parents might not appreciate being called out in front of others, even if they're wrong.\n\nBut the author's intention is to correct a misstatement, not to mock the profession. The parents are the ones misrepresenting. So, while the author's approach might be tactless, the act of correcting the factual inaccuracy isn't necessarily wrong. The key here is whether it's appropriate to correct in that context.\n\nHowever, the author is a coworker, so maybe they should address it privately instead of in social settings. By bringing it up in every conversation, the author might be overstepping. But the parents are being deceptive. The line here is between being honest and respecting privacy. \n\nIn some cases, correcting someone publicly can be seen as rude, especially if they're family. The parents might feel that their son's achievement, while different, is still valid, and they might want to present it in a more prestigious light. The author's insistence on the truth could be coming from a place of wanting to prevent misinformation.\n\nBut the parents are the ones who are being misleading. The author's actions, while perhaps not the most tactful, are pointing out the truth. So the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are the ones who are misrepresenting, so the author isn't the asshole. The answer would be B (No).\n"
