With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So the situation is about a coworker whose son is in chiropractic school, but the coworker and his wife refer to it as \"Medical School\" and say the son will be a doctor at 23. The author corrects them whenever they do that, leading to some negative reactions from the parents. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is correcting the coworker's misrepresentation. Chiropractic school is different from medical school. Medical doctors (MDs) go through a different educational process and have a different scope of practice. So when the coworker says their son is in medical school, that's technically incorrect and could be misleading. The author is pointing out the factual inaccuracy.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's parents might be doing this to elevate their son's status, perhaps because they're not as proud of a chiropractor as they would be of an MD. The author is trying to correct that misrepresentation, which could be seen as being honest or as being a stickler for details. The parents might feel embarrassed or defensive if their son's field isn't as respected in society, so they might be inflating the title to sound more impressive.\n\nThe author argues that the parents should be proud of the actual accomplishment. But is it the author's place to correct them every time? In social settings, sometimes people exaggerate or use different terms for effect. The author's interventions are causing discomfort, as noted by the glares and side eye. Maybe the author is overstepping by correcting them publicly, which could be hurtful.\n\nBut then again, if the parents are misrepresenting their son's education, that's a form of dishonesty. The author might believe it's important to be accurate. However, the author is doing this in social situations, which could be seen as a breach of social etiquette. People might have different reasons for how they present their family's achievements, even if it's technically incorrect. The parents might not want to be corrected, especially if they feel it's a sensitive topic.\n\nI should consider the balance between honesty and social grace. The author is being truthful, but the method of correction might be causing unnecessary conflict. The parents might not appreciate the public corrections, even if the author's intention is good. On the other hand, if the author is just pointing out the facts without malice, maybe it's justified. But the parents' reaction suggests that they feel disrespected or embarrassed.\n\nAnother angle is the societal perception of chiropractors. If there's a stigma or lower status associated with that profession, the parents might be trying to avoid that. The author's correction could be seen as perpetuating that stigma. However, the author mentions that they aren't dismissing the accomplishment, just pointing out the factual inaccuracy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the coworker's parents are the ones misrepresenting the information. The author's role here is to correct it, but maybe there's a more tactful way to handle it. Public corrections can be hurtful, even if well-intentioned. The author might be in the wrong for not addressing it privately or for being too direct in social settings where such details aren't crucial.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intentions are to correct a misrepresentation, but their method might be causing more harm than good. However, the parents are the ones providing false information. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the truth, but perhaps the approach is not the best. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is being truthful and the parents are being deceptive, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the social context and the way it's handled complicates things.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's corrections are necessary in social situations. If the author is in an environment where factual accuracy is important, their actions are justified. If it's a casual setting where the parents want to present their son's achievements in a certain light, the author might be overstepping. The parents have every right to be proud of their son's accomplishments in chiropractic school, even if they choose to frame it differently. The author's corrections could be seen as undermining the parents' pride, even if the facts are correct.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's corrections are factually accurate, the manner in which they are delivered in social settings might be causing unnecessary conflict. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong because they are not respecting the parents' choice to present the information in a way that makes them feel proud, even if it's not technically accurate.\n"
