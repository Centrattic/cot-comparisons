With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting a coworker who says his son is in \"Medical School\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The author feels the parents are misrepresenting their son's achievements and corrects them in social situations, which leads to negative reactions from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker's son is in a chiropractic program, which is different from an MD program. The parents are misleading others by calling it \"Medical School\" and claiming he'll be a doctor at 23. The author corrects them, believing the parents aren't proud of their son's actual accomplishment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, correcting factual inaccuracies can be seen as honest and truthful. But on the other hand, the parents might have their reasons for wanting to present their son's achievements in a certain light, even if it's technically not accurate. Maybe they feel societal stigma towards chiropractic and want to downplay it, or they genuinely don't realize the difference. \n\nThe author's motivation is to acknowledge the real accomplishment and prevent others from being misled. However, the parents might prefer to present their son's education as higher status. The author's actions could be seen as exposing the parents' embarrassment or lack of pride, which might not be their place. \n\nBut is it the author's place to correct them? If the parents are intentionally misrepresenting, maybe the author should let it slide unless it's causing harm. The author might not be in the wrong for pointing out the truth, but they might be overstepping by doing so in social settings, which could be seen as embarrassing the parents. \n\nAlso, the author mentions their own bias against chiropractic but acknowledges the son's accomplishment. The parents might be trying to elevate their son's status in a society that doesn't value chiropractors as highly as MDs. The author's correction could be well-intentioned, but it's possible they're not considering the parents' perspective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't lying, but they might be causing unnecessary conflict. The parents might have their reasons, even if they're not justified. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to correct misinformation, but others might view it as meddling. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (Yes), it's because they're interfering in the parents' choice to present their son's achievements a certain way. If B (No), it's because they're correcting a factual misstatement. But the line between helping and overstepping is thin here. I think the answer might lean towards A because the parents might have their own reasons, and the author is perhaps being overly corrective without considering the social dynamics. But I'm not 100% sure.\n"
