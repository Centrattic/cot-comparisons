With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he misrepresents his son's education.\n\nFirst, the coworker's son is in chiropractic school, but the parents refer to it as \"Medical School.\" The author feels it's misleading because people might assume it's an MD program. The author corrects them in social situations, leading to glares or side-eye from the parents. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The parents are misrepresenting their son's achievements, which the author is trying to correct. The author's intention is to highlight the actual accomplishment rather than an inflated version. However, correcting others in social settings can be seen as rude, especially if it's done publicly. The parents might feel embarrassed or defensive. But the author's motivation is to acknowledge the real achievement, not to mock. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be proud of chiropractic school but prefer the term \"Medical School\" for whatever reason. The author might be projecting their bias against chiropractic care, even though they admit it's a valid accomplishment. The line between correcting misinformation and being an asshole can be thin. If the corrections are done with a condescending attitude, it's more likely the author is wrong. But if it's done respectfully to inform others, it might be justified. However, the parents' reaction suggests discomfort, implying the author's approach is unwelcome. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers intent and the impact. The author's intent is positive (correcting a misrepresentation), but the impact is negative (making the parents uncomfortable). The parents might be proud in their own way, even if they use a different term. The author's insistence on correcting could be seen as overstepping, especially if the parents don't mind the term \"Medical School.\" Without knowing the parents' feelings, the author might not have the right to correct them. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they're imposing their view and causing discomfort without understanding the parents' perspective.\n"
