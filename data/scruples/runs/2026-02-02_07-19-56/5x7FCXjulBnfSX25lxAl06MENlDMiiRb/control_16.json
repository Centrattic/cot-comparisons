With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who corrected their co-worker about their son's education is in the wrong. The co-worker's son is in chiropractic college, but the family refers to it as \"medical school,\" leading others to believe it's an MD program. The author feels it's important to clarify this, even though it causes some discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Chiropractic school is a legitimate field, but it's different from medical school (MD or DO). The parents might be emphasizing the prestige or the common perception of medical school, which is often seen as more respected. The author's intention is to correct the misinformation, but maybe the family is proud of their son's accomplishment in their own way and just wants to present it in a more impressive light.\n\nIs it the author's place to correct them? If the family is intentionally misleading people, then maybe there's a case for pointing it out. However, if they're just using a term that's socially acceptable or they perceive as equivalent, the author might be overstepping. Also, the family's reaction\u2014glares and side eye\u2014suggests they're not happy with the correction, which could indicate they don't want the distinction highlighted.\n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to be honest, which is commendable, but they might not be considering the family's feelings or motivations. Perhaps the parents are proud of their son's path but feel societal pressure to present it as more prestigious. The author's correction could be seen as dismissive of their pride or the value they place on their son's choice.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely concerned about the misrepresentation, especially in professional or social settings where this misinformation could lead to incorrect assumptions, there's a valid point there. However, the key here is whether the family's statements are false or misleading. Chiropractic school is a different academic path, so technically, calling it medical school is incorrect. But the parents might not be intending to deceive, just to convey pride in a way they think is more impressive.\n\nThe author's motivation is to correct the record, but the method might be causing unnecessary conflict. Maybe a more diplomatic approach could be better, like discussing it privately rather than in public social settings where it causes embarrassment. The fact that the family reacts negatively suggests that the author's approach is causing discomfort without necessarily addressing a malicious intent on the family's part.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a point about factual accuracy, the situation might not be as clear-cut. The family's pride and how they choose to present their son's achievements could be valid to them, even if it's technically inaccurate. The author's actions, though well-intentioned, might be causing more harm by embarrassing the family and not addressing the underlying issue of societal perceptions of different professions.\n"
