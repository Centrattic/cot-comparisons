With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about correcting a coworker's parents who are stating their son is in medical school when he's actually in chiropractic college. The author does this correction in social settings, which leads to negative reactions from the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Chiropractic college is a real and legitimate program, but it's different from medical school (MD). The parents are choosing to present their son's education as medical school, which could be misleading because people might not know the difference. The author feels it's important to set the record straight, even though it might lead to awkwardness.\n\nNow, the key points: The author is correcting the parents, which leads to glares or side-eye. The author's reasoning is that the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment, hence the misrepresentation. The parents might have their own reasons for not disclosing the true program\u2014maybe stigma around chiropractic care, or they just want to present it as more prestigious.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, correcting someone in a social setting can come off as confrontational. Even if the author's intent is to be honest, doing so publicly might be seen as embarrassing the parents, especially if they're not open about their own feelings about their son's choice. The parents might have their own biases or reasons for the misrepresentation, which the author is not privy to.\n\nHowever, the author is also trying to present the facts accurately and might feel that the parents are misrepresenting their son's achievements. The author's actions could be seen as trying to uphold truth, but the method (public correction) might be inappropriate. But is that the author's fault? Maybe the author should have approached it differently, like talking to the parents privately first. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the act itself.\n\nIn some cultures, correcting others in public is considered rude, regardless of the intent. So even if the author's intentions are good, the act of publicly correcting might be seen as crossing a social boundary. On the other hand, if the parents are actively misleading others, the author might feel compelled to correct the misinformation, especially if it's affecting others' perceptions.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions that others assume the son is in an MD program. If the parents are intentionally misleading people, that's their choice, but the author is trying to prevent that misinformation. However, the author could be overstepping by not considering the parents' reasons. Maybe the parents are proud but think the term \"chiropractic\" isn't as well-known or respected. The author's correction might prevent others from respecting the son's achievement properly, even if it's a different path.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it the author's place to correct the parents? If the parents are not hiding it from their son but are just not disclosing in social settings, maybe the author shouldn't interfere. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention is to set the record straight, but the method of correction in a public setting could be the issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the act itself, not the method. So if the author is right to correct the misinformation, but the way they do it is wrong, then perhaps the answer is a mix. But the options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nConsidering all this, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the correction is made in a public setting, causing discomfort, and the author might not have the right to correct someone else's family's choices, even if they find it misleading. However, if the parents are actively misrepresenting, the author might not be in the wrong. But the line here is thin. Since the author is doing this every time, maybe it's considered rude persistence, hence A. But the other side could argue that the author is being truthful, so B. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A because the author's actions are causing conflict, and respecting others' choices, even if they're different, is important. Unless the parents are lying maliciously, which the author doesn't know.\n"
