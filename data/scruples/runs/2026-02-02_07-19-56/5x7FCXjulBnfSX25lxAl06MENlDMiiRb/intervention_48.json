With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about correcting a coworker who says their son is in medical school, but he's actually in chiropractic college. The author is doing this every time the coworker's parents mention it in social settings. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The coworker's family is misrepresenting the son's education. The author feels that this is misleading because people might assume he's in an MD program. The author corrects them, leading to negative reactions like glares. The author's reasoning is that the parents should be proud of the actual accomplishment, not the inflated version.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, the coworker's family is being deceptive by not disclosing the correct information. The author is correcting the record, which could be seen as honest or disruptive. On the other hand, the author is making a point in social situations, which might be uncomfortable for others. \n\nBut the key here is intent. The author isn't just correcting for accuracy; they have an underlying bias against chiropractic care, but they state they're setting that aside. They also acknowledge that the accomplishment is real and commendable. Their main issue is that the parents aren't proud of the actual achievement, hence the need to correct.\n\nIs it the author's place to correct in every social situation? Maybe they could be more tactful. However, the parents are intentionally misrepresenting the facts. The author might feel that by not correcting, others are being misled. But should the author insert themselves into family conversations to do so? It might come off as nosy or judgmental, even if the intent is to be truthful.\n\nHowever, the parents' actions are the ones that are arguably more problematic. They are intentionally omitting key details to inflate their son's status. The author is pointing out the truth, which might be necessary. But the method\u2014correcting in every instance\u2014could be seen as overstepping. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while lying or misleading is bad, correcting someone's family in public might not be the best approach. The author could choose to address it privately or not at all if it's not their place. But the author's motivation is to highlight the parents' lack of pride in the real achievement, which is a judgment about their character. \n\nSo, the author might be in the right in terms of factual correction but in the wrong in terms of how and why they're doing it. They are making a personal judgment about the parents' pride and inserting themselves into a family matter. The parents are the ones who are being deceptive, so the main issue is on their side. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might be too intrusive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they are overstepping their role by repeatedly correcting a family member in public settings, even if the information is misleading.\n"
