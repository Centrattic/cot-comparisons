With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he says his son is in \"Medical School,\" when he's actually in Chiropractic college. The coworker's family seems to be exaggerating or misrepresenting their son's education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. In many places, the term \"Doctor\" (Dr.) can be used by chiropractors, even though they aren't medical doctors (MDs). So technically, if the son is attending chiropractic college and will have a DC (Doctor of Chiropractic), he can legally use \"Dr.\" once licensed. However, the parents might be conflating that with MD programs, which are different and more rigorous. \n\nThe author's issue is that the parents are misrepresenting the son's status by not mentioning it's a chiropractic school. The author corrects them in social settings, which leads to tension. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are choosing to present their son's education in a way that might be misleading. The author feels they should be proud of the actual accomplishment and not inflate it. On one hand, correcting others in social situations can be seen as causing discomfort or embarrassing the parents. But on the other hand, the author might believe that honesty is important, especially if there's a risk of misinformation.\n\nHowever, the key here is whether the author has the right to correct them. If the parents are misrepresenting their son's education intentionally to sound more impressive, the author might think they're being honest by clarifying. But if the author is doing it in a condescending or judgmental way, that could be the issue. The question is whether the author is overstepping by constantly correcting, leading to side-eye from the parents. \n\nAlso, the author mentions their own bias against chiropractic but acknowledges the son's hard work. So the correction isn't based on discrediting the son's achievement but on factual accuracy. \n\nIn many cases, social norms allow for some embellishment, especially in family contexts. The parents might not see it as lying but as a way to present their son's success more favorably. The author's insistence on correcting might be seen as not respecting the parents' desire to present the information in a certain way unless it's actually deceptive. \n\nHowever, if the parents are explicitly lying (like claiming he's in an MD program when he's not), then the author might have a point. But if they're just omitting the term \"chiropractic\" and the son is legitimately on a path to becoming a doctor (DC), then the parents aren't lying, just using a term that's technically correct but could be confusing. \n\nSo, the author's problem is that they feel the parents aren't proud of the actual accomplishment. But the parents might be proud and just want to present it in a way that others understand as a \"doctor\" title. The author's correction could be seen as undermining their efforts to make their son's achievements sound more impressive, even if it's technically not an MD. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for constantly correcting the parents in social settings, especially if it's causing discomfort and the parents aren't technically lying. Unless the author can prove that the parents are intentionally deceiving others, the author's actions could be seen as intrusive or unsolicited.\n"
