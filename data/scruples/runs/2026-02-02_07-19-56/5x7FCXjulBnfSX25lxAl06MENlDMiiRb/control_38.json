With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker and his parents when they refer to their son being in \"Medical School\" while he's actually in Chiropractic college. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, the author feels that the coworker's family is misleading others by not specifying that the son is in Chiropractic school instead of medical school. The author corrects them in social situations, which leads to some negative reactions like glares. The author's reasoning is that they should be proud of the actual accomplishment without inflating it.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The coworker's family is technically not lying\u2014they're not saying \"Medical School\" but rather omitting the specific type. So is it a lie of omission? That's a gray area. On one hand, if someone asks where their son is studying, saying \"Medical School\" without specifying could lead others to assume it's a medical doctor program. Chiropractic school is different, with different academic requirements and professional outcomes. So the family might be misrepresenting the son's status.\n\nBut from another angle, the parents might feel that the distinction isn't important for social purposes. They could be trying to highlight the achievement of their son attending any graduate program, especially if chiropractic school is competitive. The author is correcting them, which might be seen as undermining the parents' pride or their son's accomplishment, even if the author's intent is to highlight the truth.\n\nThe author argues that the family isn't proud of the son being in chiropractic school if they feel the need to present it as medical school. But maybe the parents are indeed proud but want to avoid stigma or lack of understanding about chiropractic work. The author's corrections might be coming from a place of wanting honesty, but the method of correction in social settings could be perceived as confrontational or insensitive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their own bias against chiropractic care but tries to set that aside. However, if the author's correction is motivated by a desire to downplay the accomplishment, even unintentionally, that could affect their judgment. The key here is whether the correction is necessary and appropriate in those social contexts.\n\nIn social situations, people often simplify or use terms that are more relatable. The parents might use \"Medical School\" as a shorthand, even if it's not technically accurate. The author's correction could be seen as being pedantic or causing unnecessary embarrassment. The family might value the positive reaction they get when people assume it's medical school, even if it's a slight misrepresentation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's intention is good\u2014they want honesty\u2014but their approach might be causing more harm by making the family feel criticized. The line between correcting misinformation and being overly critical is thin here. The family's actions, while technically not entirely truthful, might be driven by good intentions to make their son's achievement sound impressive in a social setting. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the family's choice to present the information in a certain way, even if it's not entirely accurate.\n"
