With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker and their parents when they refer to the son's Chiropractic college as \"Medical School.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker's son is in chiropractic school, which is different from medical school. The parents are telling people he's in medical school, leading others to assume he's an MD. The author corrects them, leading to tension.\n\nFrom a factual standpoint, chiropractic and medical schools are different. Chiropractors don't get MD degrees, and the two fields have distinct educational paths and professional scopes. So, the parents are technically incorrect when they call it medical school. The author is pointing out a factual inaccuracy, which could be seen as justified. However, the parents might be doing this to make their child's achievements seem more prestigious. \n\nNow, the author's intention is to be accurate and proud of the real accomplishment. But their method of correcting the parents in social settings causes discomfort. The parents might feel defensive or embarrassed, leading to side-eye or glare. The question is whether the author is overstepping by publicly correcting them, even if the correction is factually correct.\n\nSome might argue that the author is right to correct misinformation, especially if it's misleading others. On the other hand, others might say that it's none of their business or that they should let the parents present their child's achievements as they see fit, even if it's not 100% accurate. \n\nThe author's motivation is to highlight the actual accomplishment and not the inflated version. But they might be projecting their own biases against chiropractic (even though they say they set that aside) by feeling the need to correct. It's possible the parents are proud but feel the need to embellish for social reasons. The author's correction could be seen as undermining their pride or making them look bad in front of others.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the author is being unnecessarily harsh or causing harm. If the correction is done in a respectful way to inform others, maybe not. But if it's done to embarrass the parents or correct every time, that could be seen as the author's fault. The key is the approach and intent. The author's stance is that they're being factual, but the parents might feel disrespected. The answer depends on balancing factual accuracy with social sensitivity.\n"
