With my biased against the profession in general aside, I am not dismissing that accomplishment at all, as it takes hard work and good grades to get in and graduate from the College of Chiropractics he is currently attending. That being the case I think that he and his parents should be extremely proud of that. \n\nHowever, in every social situation I am in with him and his wife they never say their son is in Chiropractic college, instead they say \"Medical School\". They also mislead further by saying he will be a \"Practicing Doctor at 23, one of the youngest in the country\". Everyone that doesn't know the family closely assumes, wrongly, that he is in an MD program. If I am in attendance in these situations I always work what kind of college he is really attending to the conversation. Normally to a glare or some side eye from his parents.  I feel that his parents should be proud of what he is actually doing and not their inflated version if his accomplishment. I feel they are not proud of him being in Chiropractic school as if they were they would not feel the need to leave that out of every conversation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for correcting their coworker when he says his son is in medical school, when he's actually in chiropractic college. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The coworker's parents are presenting their son's education as medical school, leading others to believe he's in an MD program. The author corrects this, pointing out it's chiropractic school. The parents react with glares or side-eye. The author's reasoning is that they should be proud of the actual accomplishment and not inflate it, and that the parents aren't proud if they're hiding the truth.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest and correcting misinformation. If the parents are misleading others by saying medical school when it's actually chiropractic, the author is right to inform others of the correct information. The author isn't belittling the accomplishment, just stating the facts. That's a valid point. People have the right to correct inaccuracies, especially if they know the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is overstepping. The coworker's family might feel embarrassed or sensitive about the difference between chiropractic and medical school, and the author's corrections could be causing discomfort. The parents might have their reasons for not wanting to clarify, such as not wanting to explain the difference in every social setting. The author's actions might be causing them embarrassment, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they don't have a bias against chiropractic and acknowledge the hard work involved. So, the correction isn't about dismissing the value but correcting a misstatement. The parents are the ones choosing to present false information, not the author. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone misrepresents their or their child's credentials, people often correct them if they know the truth. The author is doing that, which is a moral stance against lying. However, the method might be causing interpersonal conflict. \n\nBut the core issue is whether correcting a false statement is the author's responsibility. If the coworker's family is intentionally misleading others, the author has a right to correct them. The parents' reaction (glare/side eye) suggests they're defensive, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the parents might feel the author is undermining their pride in their son's achievement. But the author's point is that the parents shouldn't be proud of a false narrative. If the parents are proud of their son's actual accomplishment, they should present it accurately. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for correcting a factual inaccuracy. They're being truthful and not allowing the parents to mislead others. The parents' actions are questionable, not the author's. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
