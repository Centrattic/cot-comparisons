He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is in a college setting where the person (the author) was eating with a friend (A), and they saw another friend (B) wearing a full suit and tie. The friend A says B does it for fun, and the author comments that B is a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then says the author was being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's comment was inappropriate. The key points here are about personal style, public judgment, and social norms. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't against any rules in a college setting, so it's more about personal choice. The author finds it unbearable and eye-rolling, but does that justify calling someone a pretentious idiot?\n\nJudging others for their appearance can be seen as rude or disrespectful, even if it doesn't affect the author. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is quite harsh and derogatory. Even if the author doesn't mind people's choices as long as it doesn't affect them, the way they expressed their opinion was confrontational and insulting.\n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that the comment crossed a line. The author's friend called them an asshole, which might indicate that the remark was unkind. The question is about whether the author overstepped. In social contexts, it's generally considered polite to avoid making negative remarks about others' appearance unless it's a private matter. Publicly calling someone a pretentious showoff in front of others could be seen as bullying or disrespecting someone's personal style.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of freedom of expression. People can express their opinions, but the manner and language used matter. Using a derogatory term like \"pretentious idiot\" is more than just an opinion; it's an insult. The author might feel they have the right to their opinion, but the way it was delivered was inappropriate.\n\nIn summary, while the author's opinion is valid, the choice of words and the public nature of the comment likely made it hurtful and unkind. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being disrespectful in their judgment.\n"
