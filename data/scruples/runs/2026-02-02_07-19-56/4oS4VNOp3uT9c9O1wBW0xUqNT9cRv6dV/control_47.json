      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who made the comment about their friend B wearing a suit being a \"pretentious idiot\" is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're in a college dining hall. Friend A points out that B has good style, and the author notices B is wearing a full suit and tie. The author assumes B is doing it for fun, not because of an event, and calls them a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then says the author was an asshole.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Well, the key points here are about judgment of others' fashion choices. The author is making a value judgment about B's attire, calling them pretentious. But is that the author's place? The user mentions they don't care about others as long as it doesn't affect them, but they still made a derogatory comment. \n\nIn social situations, people often have different standards. Wearing a suit in a casual setting might seem out of place, but others might choose to do it for fun or personal style. The author's comment is harsh and disrespectful, even if they don't care personally. It's about how they expressed their opinion. \n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that they found the comment unkind. The author's comment could be seen as dismissive and rude, even if it's their opinion. People have the right to express their style, and commenting on it negatively without context can be judgmental. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they made a harsh judgment about someone else's choice without knowing the reason. Even if B was being pretentious, the term \"idiot\" is offensive. So, Answer A (yes, the author is in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
