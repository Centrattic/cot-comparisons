He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall. The situation is in a college setting. The friend A comments on friend B's style, and the author responds by calling B a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then says the author was an asshole for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't a formal event, so maybe the author thinks it's unnecessary. But does that mean calling someone a pretentious idiot is okay? Well, name-calling is usually considered harsh. The author's friend A is upset about the comment. The author says they don't care about others unless it affects them, but the comment was directed at someone else's choice.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally have the right to dress how they want unless it's against specific rules. The dining hall probably doesn't have a dress code. So, the author's judgment might be unwarranted. Also, using harsh language like \"pretentious idiot\" could be seen as rude, even if they just disagree with the clothing choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the suit is out of place, but expressing that by name-calling crosses a line. The friend A's reaction suggests that the comment was offensive. So the author might have overstepped. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for the harsh language and judgment. Answer A.\n"
