He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was with a friend who noticed another friend wearing a suit. The author's friend comments on the style, and the author responds by calling the person a showoff and a pretentious idiot. The friend then says the author was being an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal style and judgment. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't against any rules, so it's a matter of personal choice. The author's reaction seems to be based on their own dislike of such behavior. But is it okay to call someone an insult like that?\n\nCalling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the author doesn't care about others' choices, using such language can be disrespectful. The friend A probably felt the comment was unnecessary or rude. The dining hall is a public space, and people have different comfort levels with their attire. The author's judgment might be seen as unkind, especially in a college setting where people often express themselves freely.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the suit-wearing is over the top in that context. But using strong language to express that opinion could be seen as attacking the person rather than the behavior. The line between expressing an opinion and being rude can be thin here.\n\nAlso, considering that the author's friend defended the other person, there might be a social norm in their circle that values politeness even in disagreements. The author's comment could damage relationships or come off as elitist if they're judging someone for dressing formally.\n\nSo, while everyone has the right to their opinion, the way the author expressed it was likely inappropriate. They didn't just state their dislike but insulted the person, which is where they might be in the wrong. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because the language used was unkind and judgmental without justification beyond personal taste.\n"
