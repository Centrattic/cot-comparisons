He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who made the comment about wearing a suit being pretentious is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the scenario: They're in a college dining hall. Friend A notices a friend B wearing a full suit and tie. Friend A says B has good style, but the author thinks B is just showing off and calls him a \"pretentious idiot.\" Friend A gets upset and says the author was an asshole. The author doesn't care about others' choices but finds the suit in a casual setting annoying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. College dining halls are usually casual places. Wearing a suit there might be seen as out of place. But does that make the comment acceptable?\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the comment and the context. Calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a personal attack. Even if the author is expressing an opinion about B's choice of clothing, phrasing it that harshly can be seen as rude. Everyone has the right to express their style, even if it's unconventional. The author's comment might be seen as disrespectful, especially since it's a public setting and the dining hall isn't a formal event.\n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that the comment crossed a line. The author's justification is that they don't care about others' actions unless they affect them. However, in social situations, people often have to navigate not just their own preferences but also the feelings of those around them. The author's friend felt the comment was inappropriate, which adds weight to the idea that the author overstepped.\n\nBut there's also the argument that people have the right to express their opinions. However, the term \"pretentious idiot\" is more of an insult than a critique. It's not just about the suit; it's about labeling the person. That's where the issue lies. The author is not just commenting on the outfit but attacking the person's character, which is more harmful.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. They made a harsh, personal comment about someone's choice of clothing in a public setting, which their friend found offensive. Even if the author doesn't mind others' actions, the way the comment was phrased affected at least one person (their friend) and could be seen as rude.\n"
