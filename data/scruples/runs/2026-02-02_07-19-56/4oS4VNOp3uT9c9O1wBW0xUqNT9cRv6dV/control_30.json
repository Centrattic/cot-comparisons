I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is that they were eating with a friend, who pointed out a mutual friend in a suit. The author then called that friend a showoff and a pretentious idiot. The friend A said the author was an asshole for commenting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dining hall is a casual place, so wearing a suit might seem out of place. But people have different styles and reasons for their clothing choices. The author's main issue is that they find it unbearable and eye-rolling, but they don't care if it affects them. The key here is whether the comment was appropriate.\n\nCalling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the author is expressing an opinion, the language used could be seen as rude. The term \"pretentious\" implies that the person is trying to appear important or cultured without really being so. However, the other person has the right to dress however they want, even if it's not the norm. The author's friend A criticized them for being an asshole, which suggests that their comment was out of line. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that they don't care about others' actions as long as it doesn't affect them. But making a derogatory comment about someone's clothing, even if it's just an opinion, can be seen as disrespectful. The dining hall is a public space, and people have different reasons for their attire. It's possible that the person was going for a certain aesthetic or had a reason to wear a suit, even if it's unusual.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered polite to avoid belittling others' choices unless there's a clear negative impact. The author's comment was personal and judgmental, which might have made their friend A uncomfortable. So, while the author has the right to their opinion, the way they expressed it could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using such language.\n"
