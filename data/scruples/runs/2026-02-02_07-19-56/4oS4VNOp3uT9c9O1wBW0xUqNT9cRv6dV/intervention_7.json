He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who called someone else a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a college dining hall with a friend. They see another friend (B) wearing a suit and the author makes a derogatory comment. Their friend (A) calls them an asshole for that. The author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about personal style and public judgment. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't against any rules, so it's a matter of personal choice. The author's comment was about B being a showoff and pretentious. Now, whether that's acceptable.\n\nIn general, people have the right to express their style, even in casual settings. However, calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a harsh judgment that can come off as rude. Even if the author doesn't mind others' choices, making a derogatory comment about someone's appearance can be seen as disrespectful. The friend (A) likely took issue with the author's tone and the choice of words. \n\nThe author argues they don't care about others' actions as long as they don't affect them. But here, the action (wearing a suit) isn't affecting the author directly, so the criticism is based on personal opinion. Publicly mocking someone's style, even if it's just a friend group, can be hurtful. It's important to consider the impact of such comments on others' feelings, even if the person is just expressing their own style.\n\nAlso, the term \"pretentious\" implies that the person is trying to appear more important or sophisticated than they are. That's a subjective judgment. The author's friend (A) might have felt that the comment was unnecessarily harsh and judgmental, hence calling the author an asshole. \n\nSo, the author's comment was a personal opinion, but the way it was expressed was likely inappropriate. While everyone has the right to their own style, commenting on someone else's choices in a derogatory manner can be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the harshness of the remark, even if their initial sentiment is understandable.\n"
