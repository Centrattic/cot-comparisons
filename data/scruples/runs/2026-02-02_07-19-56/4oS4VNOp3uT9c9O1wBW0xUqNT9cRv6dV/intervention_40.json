He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" because they wore a suit to the dining hall.\n\nFirst, the context: They're in college, eating with a friend. Friend A points out Friend B's style, and the author comments that B is showy and a pretentious idiot. Friend A thinks the author was an asshole. The user feels that wearing a suit for a casual meal is unnecessary and annoying.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal style and public judgment. Wearing a suit in a dining hall isn't against any rules, just a personal choice. The author's reaction is name-calling, which is harsh. The question is whether the comment was uncalled for.\n\nPretentiousness is subjective. What one person sees as showing off, another might see as confidence or personal expression. The dining hall is a public space where people can dress how they want unless there's a dress code. The author's comment was directed at someone they don't have a conflict with, just a difference in opinion on style.\n\nName-calling, even in a social setting, can be seen as rude. The author might feel justified, but the term \"pretentious idiot\" crosses into personal attack rather than a constructive opinion. The fact that their friend called them an asshole suggests that the reaction was too harsh.\n\nHowever, freedom of expression is a factor. The author isn't doing anything illegal, just expressing an opinion. But in social interactions, how you express your opinion matters. Calling someone an idiot is more offensive than saying you don't like the style.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's comment was disrespectful and unnecessary. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they made a personal attack on someone's choice without justification beyond their own preference.\n"
