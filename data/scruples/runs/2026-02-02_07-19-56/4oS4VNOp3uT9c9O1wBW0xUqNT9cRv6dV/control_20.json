He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. The situation is that their friend A commented on friend B's style, saying B wears suits for fun. The author then calls B a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and friend A says they were being an asshole. The user wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. College students often have varied styles, and some might choose to wear suits even in casual settings. The author's comment was a direct insult, which could be seen as rude. But does that make them wrong?\n\nWell, freedom of expression is a factor. People can express their opinions, but the way they do it matters. Calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the opinion is subjective, the term \"pretentious\" can be subjective too. However, labeling someone as an idiot is more aggressive.\n\nAlso, considering that the author doesn't care about others' actions unless they're affected, but they found the suit choice unbearable. That's their opinion, but public criticism can be seen as unkind. The friend A defended B, thinking the author was being an asshole. So, maybe the author overstepped.\n\nIs there a cultural context? In some places, formal attire in casual settings might be frowned upon, but in others, it's a personal choice. The key here is the reaction. The author's comment was personal and derogatory, even if it's their opinion. So, they might be in the wrong for the way they expressed their opinion rather than the opinion itself.\n\nAnother angle: was the comment necessary? The author was eating with a friend, saw another friend, and made a judgmental remark. That could create tension. Even if the author doesn't care, their words might have hurt someone's feelings, even if indirectly.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's words were harsh and personal, which might be considered rude. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
