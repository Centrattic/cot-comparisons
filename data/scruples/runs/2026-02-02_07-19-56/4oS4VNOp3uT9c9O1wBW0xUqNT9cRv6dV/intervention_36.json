He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" because they wore a suit to the dining hall. The setup is that the writer was with their friend A, who pointed out friend B wearing a suit, and the writer responded with that comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In a college setting, people might wear different styles for various reasons\u2014maybe it's part of a club, a personal choice, or just how they feel. The writer assumes that B is wearing the suit \"for fun\" or to show off, but maybe there's another reason. However, the writer's friend A thinks the comment was harsh.\n\nThe key points here are the writer's intention and the appropriateness of the insult. The comment \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty strong. Even if the writer didn't mean to be offensive, using such language in public could be seen as rude. Also, the writer's friend called them an asshole, which suggests that the friend felt the comment was out of line.\n\nI should also think about whether the writer had the right to make that comment. If the person's choice of clothing isn't affecting others, then commenting on it might be a personal style issue. However, calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a direct insult that could hurt feelings or be perceived as judgmental without knowing the full story. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer might feel that the suit is out of place in a casual setting like a dining hall. But maybe they didn't consider that B could have a valid reason for dressing that way. The writer's friend A probably saw it as an unnecessary personal attack. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer's comment was likely uncalled for. Even if the opinion is about someone else's fashion choice, the harsh language makes it a personal attack. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for using such a derogatory term without knowing the context and for being judgmental in a way that offends their friend.\n"
