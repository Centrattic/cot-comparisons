I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is at fault for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" because they wore a suit to the dining hall. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the scenario is in a college setting. The author was eating with friend A, who points out friend B wearing a full suit. The author comments that B is being a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then criticizes the author for being an asshole. The author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about judgment of others' clothing choices and the appropriateness of the language used. Wearing a suit in a casual setting like a dining hall isn't inherently wrong. People might wear formal clothes for various reasons\u2014personal style, a job requirement, or just because they like it. The author's issue seems to be with the intention behind B's choice, thinking it's for \"fun\" or to show off.\n\nNow, the author's response was to call B a \"pretentious idiot.\" That's a strong and derogatory term. Even if the author doesn't care about others' choices as long as it doesn't affect them, the use of such language could be seen as judgmental and disrespectful. People have different styles, and it's not everyone's responsibility to agree with someone else's fashion sense.\n\nFriend A's reaction that the author was being an asshole might be valid because the comment crossed into name-calling. Even if the author's intention was just to critique the choice, the harshness of the language could make it seem like an attack on B's character rather than just a disagreement on style.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that their opinion is valid and they have the right to express it. But the issue is whether the response was appropriate. Insulting someone for their clothing choices, even if they don't impact you, can be seen as inconsiderate. It's about respecting others' choices, even if you don't understand them.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's use of a derogatory term without knowing B's reasons could be seen as judgmental. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong for the harsh language and judgment.\n"
