He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made the comment is in the wrong. The situation is that they called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit at the dining hall. Their friend A thought the comment was harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if wearing a suit in a dining hall is unreasonable. There's no dress code mentioned, so maybe the person just prefers formal attire. It's their choice unless it's against the rules. The author's friend A seems okay with B's style, but the author finds it showy.\n\nCalling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty strong. Pretentious usually means trying to appear more important or cultured than they are. But maybe the person just likes suits and isn't pretending. The author's judgment is based on their own opinion without knowing B's reasons. \n\nIs it the author's place to judge? The friend A defended B, so maybe the author overstepped. Even if it's a free country, being rude about someone's clothing can be seen as unkind. The author says they don't care about others' actions as long as it doesn't affect them. So they're not directly harmed, but their comment could have made B or A feel uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the term \"pretentious idiot\" is derogatory and might be an insult without evidence. The author assumes B's intent without knowing for sure. So, even if the author thinks it's a showoff, the harsh language and public judgment might make them in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They made a judgmental comment based on their own opinion and used a derogatory term without knowing the other person's reasons. Their friend's reaction suggests that the comment was unwelcome, which supports that the author overstepped.\n"
