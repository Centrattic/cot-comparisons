He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is in a college setting. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user was with a friend (Friend A) who made a comment about another friend (Friend B) wearing a suit. The user then called Friend B a \"pretentious idiot\" because they thought it was for show, not necessity. Friend A was upset and called the user an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about judgment of others' fashion choices and the appropriateness of the language used. The user is questioning if their reaction was justified.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different opinions on what's appropriate to wear in casual settings like a dining hall. Some might see wearing a suit as overdressing and pretentious, while others might not have an issue with it. The user's use of the term \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if they don't care about others' choices, making a derogatory comment could come off as rude, especially in public.\n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that he found the comment offensive. The user's justification is that they don't mind others' actions unless they affect them, but the comment here was directed at someone else. The user might have overstepped by making a personal attack rather than just ignoring or perhaps making a lighter comment.\n\nLegally, the user isn't in the wrong since it's a matter of opinion and free speech. But socially, the question is about whether their behavior was appropriate. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is derogatory and can be seen as disrespectful. Even if the user believes the other person's choice is pretentious, labeling them an idiot is crossing a line.\n\nSo, considering social etiquette, the user might be in the wrong for the harsh language, even if the opinion itself is subjective. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the way they expressed their opinion was disrespectful.\n"
