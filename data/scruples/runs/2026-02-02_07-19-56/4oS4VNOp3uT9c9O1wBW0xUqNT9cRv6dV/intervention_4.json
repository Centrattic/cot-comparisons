He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that they were eating with a friend, and their friend's other friend, B, was wearing a suit to the dining hall. The original poster (OP) called B a \"pretentious idiot\" because they thought it was showy and unnecessary. Their friend A got mad at them for being an asshole. The OP is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. College is a place with diverse styles and people. Wearing a suit to the dining hall might be unusual, but it's not illegal or harmful. The key here is whether the comment was mean-spirited or if it was a legitimate opinion.\n\nThe OP's main argument is that they don't care about others' choices unless it affects them, but the comment was about B's choice of clothing. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Pretentious implies someone is trying to appear more important or knowledgeable than they are. Calling someone an idiot is a strong insult.\n\nFriend A defended B, which suggests that maybe the comment crossed a line. Even if the OP thought the suit was out of place, calling someone names can be seen as disrespectful. The fact that the friend was upset might indicate that the comment was unnecessary or harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to their opinions. The OP isn't doing anything wrong by expressing their view, but the way they expressed it might be the issue. Using derogatory language can hurt others' feelings, even if the subject isn't directly affected. Also, the dining hall is a shared space, and while suits aren't common, there's no rule against it. So, B's choice is a personal style choice.\n\nThe question is whether the OP was wrong. The answer hinges on whether the comment was an honest opinion versus an insult. \"Pretentious idiot\" is an insult, not just an opinion. So, while the OP is allowed to have an opinion, the way they expressed it was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (they are in the wrong) because the language used was disrespectful and hurtful.\n"
