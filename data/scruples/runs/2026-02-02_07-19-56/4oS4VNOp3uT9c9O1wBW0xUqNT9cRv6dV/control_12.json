I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called someone else a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall was in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're in college, which is a place where people have varying styles. Friend A noticed Friend B's suit and commented on the style. The author then called B a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A thought the author was being an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal expression and social norms. Wearing a suit to the dining hall isn't against any rules, just maybe unconventional. The author's reaction is based on their personal opinion, but using harsh language like \"pretentious idiot\" might be crossing a line. \n\nBut then, the author mentions they don't care about others' actions as long as it doesn't affect them. Maybe they just dislike the pretentiousness they perceive. However, labeling someone as a \"pretentious idiot\" is a strong and potentially hurtful statement. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they made a judgment without knowing B's reasons. B might have just wanted to look sharp, and the author's comment could be seen as rude or judgmental.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend thought they were being an asshole, which suggests that the comment was inappropriate. Also, in a college setting, people might express themselves in different ways, and the author's reaction could come off as elitist. However, if the author is just voicing their opinion in a casual conversation, maybe it's not the end of the world. But the term \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh, so the author might be at fault here.\n\nI think the main issue is the harshness of the language rather than the opinion itself. People can have opinions about fashion, but attacking someone's character is problematic. So the author is in the wrong because they used a derogatory term without considering B's perspective. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
