He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were in a college dining hall, and the friend B was wearing a full suit and tie. The author's friend A mentioned B's good style, but the author disagreed, thinking B was showing off and being pretentious. The author called B a \"pretentious idiot,\" and A thought the author was being an asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here are about public comment on someone's clothing. Is it wrong to criticize someone's fashion choice in a public setting? Well, people have different opinions on style. If someone chooses to wear formal attire in an informal place, some might see it as pretentious, others might admire their style. However, using a derogatory term like \"pretentious idiot\" could be seen as harsh, even if the opinion is held. \n\nThe author's argument is that they don't care about others as long as it doesn't affect them. But commenting publicly in a derogatory way might cross the line into being disrespectful. Even if the author feels it's their right to have an opinion, the way they expressed it could be considered unkind or condescending. \n\nAlso, the friend A defended the other friend, which suggests that maybe the comment was unwelcome. The author's friend thought they were being an asshole, so that's another perspective to consider. In social settings, it's often about how your words make others feel. If the author's comment made B feel belittled, even if unintentionally, that might be the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in the wrong for having an opinion. Everyone has the right to their own style preferences. The problem might be in the choice of words rather than the opinion itself. Using \"pretentious idiot\" is more offensive than saying \"I don't think that's appropriate here\" or \"I find that a bit over the top.\"\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's comment was probably unnecessarily harsh. The friend A's reaction indicates that the tone was off-putting. The author's right to their opinion doesn't excuse the harshness of the language used. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they expressed their opinion, even if they believe the opinion itself is valid.\n"
