He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is: they're at a college dining hall with a friend, A. Friend A points out their friend B who's wearing a suit, commenting on his style. The author notices that B might have just come from an interview or event, but A says B does it for fun. The author then calls B a \"pretentious idiot\" and a showoff, and A gets mad, saying the author was an asshole. The author is confused because they don't mind others' choices unless it affects them, but think the suit is over the top. They're asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. First, I need to think about social norms. College dining halls are usually casual places. Wearing a suit there might be unusual. But is it wrong? The author's friend A is okay with B's choice, but the author isn't. The key point is calling someone a \"pretentious idiot.\" That's pretty harsh. Even if someone is showing off, calling them that is rude. The author's friend A thinks they were being an asshole, which suggests that the comment was out of line.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they don't care unless it affects them, but they still made a judgment. Maybe the issue is that the author is publicly insulting someone else's choice without knowing their reasons. Maybe B really likes suits and wants to express himself that way. The author's comment could be seen as disrespectful. Even if they think it's pretentious, name-calling isn't appropriate. So the author might be in the wrong because their language was harsh and unwarranted, regardless of their opinion on the suit. The right approach might have been to discuss their opinion without calling someone an idiot. So answer A.\n"
