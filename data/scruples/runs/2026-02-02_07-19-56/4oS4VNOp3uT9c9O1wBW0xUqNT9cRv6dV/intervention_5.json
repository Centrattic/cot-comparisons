He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is in a college setting. The person, let's call them Person C, was eating with Friend A, who mentioned their friend B's style. Friend B was wearing a full suit and tie. Person C comments that B is a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then says Person C was being an asshole. They don't care about others' choices unless it affects them, but they find the suit in that context unbearable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Wearing a suit to a dining hall is not typical, but it's not against any rules unless specified. People have the right to dress as they please in most public spaces. The key here is whether the comment was justified. The user's friend A thinks the comment was an asshole move, so there's social judgment here.\n\nThe word \"pretentious\" implies that someone is trying to appear more important or refined than they are. However, if B is genuinely comfortable wearing a suit and it's their personal choice, then calling them pretentious might be an assumption without knowing their reason. Maybe B likes the style, it's a personal preference, or they're into fashion. The dining hall isn't a formal setting, so the contrast might be what's making Person C judge. But is that a valid reason to make a derogatory comment?\n\nAlso, the fact that Person C doesn't care about others' choices unless it affects them, but here it does bother them. However, the comment they made was not just an opinion but a derogatory term. Even if they don't care about B's actions, the way they expressed their opinion might be harsh. The question is about whether the comment was in the wrong, not just the action of wearing the suit.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while freedom of expression exists, calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is quite harsh and can be seen as rude. The friend A's reaction suggests that the comment was unkind. Even if Person C felt the suit was inconsiderate or out of place, using such language could be seen as attacking the person rather than their choice. It's possible that the comment was a personal attack rather than a critique of the clothing choice.\n\nTherefore, the author's judgment of B's clothing choice as pretentious might be an overreaction, and the language used is offensive, which makes the author in the wrong.\n"
