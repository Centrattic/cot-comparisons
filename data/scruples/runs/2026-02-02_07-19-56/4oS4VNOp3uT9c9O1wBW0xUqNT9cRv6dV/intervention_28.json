He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall. The author's friend A thought the person was showing off, and the author made a harsh comment, leading A to say they were an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The dining hall is a casual place. Wearing a suit there might be considered over-the-top by some. The author's comment was \"showoff\" and \"pretentious idiot.\" That's pretty strong language. Even if they don't care about others' choices, using such a derogatory term could be seen as rude. The friend A defended the person, suggesting that maybe the author overstepped.\n\nBut then, the author's reasoning is that they don't mind others unless it affects them, but they found the suit unbearable and eye-rolling. People have different opinions on fashion, and while it's their choice to dress a certain way, calling someone a pretentious idiot is a judgmental remark. The question is whether the author's comment was justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, being judgmental about others' choices without considering their perspective often leads to being in the wrong. The author's friend A felt the comment was harsh, so maybe the author was too quick to judge. However, the author isn't doing anything harmful, just expressing an opinion. The line between a valid opinion and a rude comment can be thin. The key here is the use of the term \"pretentious idiot,\" which is more of a personal attack than a critique of the clothing choice. So the author might be in the wrong for using such language, even if they didn't intend to be mean. So the answer is A.\n"
