He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend B a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. The situation is in a college setting, so the context is casual, not formal.\n\nFirst, the main point is about calling someone a pretentious idiot. The user made a derogatory comment about their friend's choice of clothing. Even if the comment was made in a conversation with a friend, using such strong language could be seen as harsh. The term \"pretentious\" implies that the person is trying to appear more important or sophisticated than they are, which is a judgment call. However, the actual clothing choice (a suit) in a dining hall might be considered out of place by some, but it's also a personal expression. The user's friend A thought the comment was mean, labeling them an asshole, which suggests that the friend felt the comment was uncalled for.\n\nThe user argues that they don't care about others' choices as long as it doesn't affect them, but the issue here is the public judgment and the harshness of the language. The dining hall is a communal space, so wearing a suit there might be unusual but not inherently wrong. The user's reaction was to mock the choice, which could be seen as disrespectful or rude. Even if they don't have a problem with others' styles, using derogatory terms like \"pretentious idiot\" crosses a line into being an asshole, especially in front of others, which might embarrass the person being discussed.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the comment was harsh and judgmental, even if the clothing choice was questionable. The key is the way the comment was made, not just the content.\n"
