I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person (author) was eating with friend A, who mentioned friend B wearing a suit. The author's friend A made a comment about B's style, and the author responded by calling B a \"pretentious idiot.\" Then friend A accused the author of being an asshole. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nSo, what's the issue here? The main point is whether the author's comment was appropriate. Let's break it down. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't a formal setting. College dining halls are usually casual places. So, someone dressing formally there might stand out, and others might find it odd or pretentious. The author's friend A thought B was doing it for fun, and the author thought B was showing off, hence the harsh comment.\n\nNow, is it okay to make such a comment? Well, even if the author doesn't care about others' dress, attacking someone's choice with an insult can be seen as rude. The key here is the language used. \"Pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the author thinks the action is pretentious, calling someone an \"idiot\" is a strong and derogatory term. It's not just about the judgment of the clothing but how it's expressed.\n\nAlso, the social context matters. In a college setting, people have diverse styles and preferences. What one person finds pretentious, another might see as a form of self-expression. The author's comment could come off as dismissive and possibly offensive, even if unintentionally. Friend A's reaction indicates that the comment was harsh. The author's friend might have felt the comment was unkind or unnecessary.\n\nBut then again, the author might argue that they're just expressing their opinion. However, the way it's phrased as an insult might cross the line. It's about balancing freedom of expression with respect for others. Even if the author isn't directly affected, public comments that demean others can create a hostile environment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was probably inconsiderate and unnecessarily harsh. They could have expressed their opinion more tactfully without using insulting language. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
