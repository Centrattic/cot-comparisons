I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the context. They're in a college dining hall, which is usually a casual setting. Wearing a full suit there might seem out of place to some. The author's friend comments that friend B wears it for fun, but the author reacts negatively, calling B a showoff.\n\nNow, the key points. The author made a derogatory comment about someone's clothing choice. Even if they don't care about others' actions, making a judgmental remark can come off as rude. The friend A thinks the author was an asshole, which suggests the comment was harsh. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty strong. Even if the author feels it's their opinion, calling someone that in public could be seen as aggressive. However, the author might argue it's just their opinion and they have the right to express it. But in social settings, especially with friends, being judgmental can affect relationships. So, the author might be in the wrong for the harsh wording, even if they have a right to their opinion. The answer might be A.\n"
