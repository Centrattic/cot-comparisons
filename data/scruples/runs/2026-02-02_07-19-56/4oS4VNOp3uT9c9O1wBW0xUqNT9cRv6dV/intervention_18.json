He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend B a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is that friend A commented on B's style, implying B does it for fun, and the author responded by calling B a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then says the author was being an asshole. The user is unsure but thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. College is a place with diverse styles and personal expressions. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't against any rules, so B's choice is about personal expression. The author's reaction is based on disliking the idea of someone showing off or trying to appear more important. But is that a valid reason to call someone those names?\n\nCalling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the author didn't care about others' actions, the use of derogatory language could come off as rude. The key here is whether the comment was a reasonable critique of style or an unnecessary personal attack. The author's friend A took offense, which suggests that the comment crossed a line. The author might be in the wrong for making personal attacks rather than just expressing a difference in opinion. Also, the author's justification is that it's \"unbearable and eyerolling,\" which shows they found it annoying but that doesn't excuse the harsh language. So, the answer is A.\n"
