He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall. The scenario is in a college setting. The friend A noticed friend B wearing a suit and thought B had good style. The author commented that B is a showoff and pretentious. Friend A then called the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's comment was inappropriate. First, I need to consider if there's a policy or context in the dining hall about attire. If there's no dress code, then B is within his rights to wear whatever he wants. The author's judgment is based on personal opinion, but is it offensive?\n\nCalling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the person is being a showoff, using such strong language might be crossing a line. The author says they don't care about others unless it affects them, but their comment was directed at B, which could have been hurtful or offensive. The friend A thought the author was being an asshole, which suggests that maybe the comment was unwarranted.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that wearing a suit to eat is \"unbearable and eyerolling,\" which is subjective. Just because someone's style doesn't fit the author's personal taste doesn't mean the person is pretentious. The key here is whether the comment was respectful. Insulting someone for their clothing choice in a public space, even if it's a dining hall, might not be the right approach. The author could have chosen to ignore it or make a more neutral comment instead of an insult.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was probably in poor taste. They made a judgment based on their opinion and used harsh language. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
