I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. So the scenario is in a college setting. The person was eating with their friend A, who comments on friend B's style. B is wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall. The user says B is a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and friend A called them an asshole for that comment.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user is in the wrong. The user's reasoning is that they don't care about others' choices as long as it doesn't affect them. They find the suit in the dining hall unbearable and annoying. The key here is whether making such a comment is unfair or if it's a personal opinion.\n\nIn general, people have the right to express their opinions about others' fashion choices, even if they find it pretentious. However, using derogatory language like \"pretentious idiot\" might be considered rude or judgmental. The dining hall is a casual setting, so wearing a suit there could be seen as out of place by some. But others might view it as a personal style choice or a way to feel confident. \n\nThe user's friend A thinks they were being an asshole, which suggests that A found the comment unkind. The user's frustration is valid in that they might not understand the necessity of such formal attire in a casual environment, but the term \"pretentious idiot\" is harsh. It's possible the user overreacted with their language, even if their opinion is understandable. \n\nSo, considering both sides, even if the user's opinion isn't wrong, the way they expressed it might have been. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because of the harsh language used in judgment. However, others might argue that it's their right to express their opinion. But given that the friend called them an asshole, it's more likely that their comment was unkind and thus they are in the wrong.\n"
