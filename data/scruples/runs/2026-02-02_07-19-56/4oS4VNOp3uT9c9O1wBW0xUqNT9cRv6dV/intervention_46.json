He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's friend a \"pretentious idiot\" is in the wrong. The situation involves someone wearing a suit to the dining hall, and the author made a judgmental comment about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person in question, B, is wearing a suit, which the author finds pretentious. The user's friend A is okay with it, but the author isn't. The key here is whether the comment was appropriate. \n\nCalling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the author finds the clothing choice annoying, using such a strong term might be crossing a line. Sarcasm or mild criticism is one thing, but labeling someone as an idiot is another. It's disrespectful and could be seen as an insult without a valid reason.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't care about others' choices unless it affects them. However, making a derogatory comment in front of a friend (friend A) might have social repercussions. Friend A feels the author was an asshole, so there's a conflict in the friendship here. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was just expressing their opinion. But the wording was aggressive. People have different styles, and while some might find certain fashion choices pretentious, it's subjective. However, the way the author expressed their opinion was unkind. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong for using such a harsh term. It's not about the clothing choice itself but how the comment was delivered. The author should have maybe expressed their opinion more politely or not commented at all if it didn't affect them.\n"
