      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is in college and was in a dining hall with friends. Their friend A comments on another friend B's style, noting that B wears a full suit and tie, which A says B does just for fun. The user then calls B a \"pretentious idiot,\" leading friend A to accuse them of being an asshole. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Wearing a suit to a casual dining hall isn't typical college attire. The user finds it pretentious and a showoff, while friend A might see it as harmless fun. The key points here are the user's comment and the social dynamics between them.\n\nCalling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a judgmental and derogatory remark. Even if the user feels it's not affecting them personally, the comment is dismissive and disrespectful towards B's choice of clothing. Friend A's reaction suggests that they might not agree with the harshness of the comment.\n\nIn social situations, especially among peers, it's important to respect others' choices unless they're harmful. Wearing a suit isn't harmful, so the user's judgment here is about personal style rather than an action that affects others. The user's justification is that they don't care about others' actions as long as it doesn't affect them, but public criticism for personal style can still be hurtful or offensive.\n\nPretentiousness is subjective. What one person sees as showing off, another might see as expressing individuality. The user's comment assumes that B's choice is inherently pretentious without considering B's reasons. Maybe B is into formal wear, or it's a personal hobby, or they just prefer the look. The user's judgment without knowing B's intent could be unfair.\n\nFriend A defending B by calling the user an asshole might indicate that the user overstepped. Publicly belittling someone, even in a conversation between friends, can create a hostile environment. The user's right to their opinion is valid, but the way they expressed it was disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering the harshness of the comment and the potential impact on others, the user might be in the wrong. The answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the comment was judgmental and disrespectful without sufficient cause.\n"
