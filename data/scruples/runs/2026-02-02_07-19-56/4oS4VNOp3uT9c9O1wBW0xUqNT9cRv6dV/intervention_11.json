He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. The situation is from a college setting where the author and a friend are eating. The friend comments on another person wearing a suit, and the author responds negatively. The friend then calls the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Wearing a suit to a casual place like a dining hall might be seen as overdressed. But is it the author's place to comment on someone else's clothing choice? The author says they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them. But the comment was a direct insult, calling someone a pretentious idiot. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, using such strong language could be hurtful. \n\nThe friend, A, reacts by saying the author was being an asshole. That suggests that the comment was inappropriate. People have different styles and reasons for dressing a certain way. Maybe B was comfortable in their outfit, or it's part of their personal expression. The author's judgment might come off as rude, even if it's just their opinion. \n\nAlso, the term \"pretentious idiot\" is a bit harsh. It's combining a judgment of pretentiousness (which is subjective) with a direct insult. Even if the author didn't intend to be mean, the words used are strong. In a college setting, where there's a diversity of styles, it's possible that others might dress differently. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that wearing a suit in a casual environment is out of place. But that's their opinion, not necessarily a fact. However, expressing that opinion in a derogatory way is where the issue lies. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's comment was an insult, and even if they didn't mean to be offensive, the language used was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
