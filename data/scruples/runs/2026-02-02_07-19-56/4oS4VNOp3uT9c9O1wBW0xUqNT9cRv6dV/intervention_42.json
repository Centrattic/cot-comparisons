He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. They want an answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author was with their friend A when they saw friend B wearing a suit. The author called B a showoff and pretentious idiot. Friend A reacted by saying the author was an asshole. The author is now unsure if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal expression and social norms. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't a formal event, so some might see it as trying too hard, but others might just enjoy the outfit. The author's comment was derogatory, which could be seen as rude. The question is whether that comment crossed a line.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. However, public shaming or putting down someone's clothing choice, even if it's just a personal opinion, can be hurtful. The author's friend defended them, but the comment itself was negative and judgmental. Even if the author doesn't care about others' actions, making a derogatory remark in a social setting might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the term \"pretentious idiot\" is harsh. It's not just an opinion but a personal attack. While everyone has the right to their opinion, expressing it in a way that's disrespectful can be seen as wrong. The author might have overstepped by using such strong language in front of others.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely A. The author's comment was rude and unnecessary, even if they didn't mean to harm anyone. Publicly calling someone a pretentious idiot is inconsiderate and disrespectful, regardless of the context. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
