He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" because they wore a suit to the dining hall. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person and their friend A were eating in the dining hall. Friend A noticed his friend B wearing a full suit and tie and commented on his style. The author assumed B was coming from an interview or formal event but then found out that B was doing it for fun. The author called B a showoff and a pretentious idiot, which A thought was an asshole comment.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's comment was justified. The author's reasoning is that wearing a suit to a casual dining hall is over-the-top and annoying. But the other person, B, might have a different reason for doing it\u2014like personal style or just enjoying formal wear. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of social norms, judging someone's clothing choices can be seen as rude, especially when you don't know their reasons. Even if the author doesn't care about others' choices, making a derogatory comment about someone else's appearance can come off as disrespectful, regardless of the context. \n\nThe term \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Pretentious implies trying to appear more important or cultured than one is, which might not be the case here. If B is wearing a suit for fun or personal preference, calling them pretentious could be an unfair assumption. The author might be projecting their own discomfort or disapproval onto B. \n\nAlso, the friend A called the author an asshole, which suggests that even their peer thought the comment was too harsh. While everyone has the right to their opinion, expressing it in a derogatory way can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author made a judgmental and harsh comment based on their assumption about B's motives. Since people have different ways of expressing themselves through clothing, the author's reaction might be seen as uncalled for. Therefore, the author is more likely in the wrong here.\n"
