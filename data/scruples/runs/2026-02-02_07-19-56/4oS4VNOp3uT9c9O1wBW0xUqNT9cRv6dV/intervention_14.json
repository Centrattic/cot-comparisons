He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is in a college dining hall, the author's friend A comments on friend B wearing a suit, and the author calls B a \"pretentious idiot\". The author's friend A then reprimands them for being an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author is being critical of someone's fashion choice. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't unusual in some contexts, maybe for interviews or events, but here B is supposedly doing it for fun. The author finds it pretentious and showy. Now, whether that's a valid criticism or not. \n\nPretentiousness is a subjective judgment. Just because someone chooses to dress formally in an informal setting doesn't inherently make them pretentious. People might have different reasons\u2014personal style, confidence, or just liking the look. The author's comment was a direct insult, calling the person an idiot, which is harsh. Even if they found it annoying, the way they expressed it was aggressive.\n\nThe friend A thought the author was being an asshole, which suggests that the comment crossed a line. Public shaming or criticizing someone's appearance can be hurtful. The author might have been justified in their opinion but not in their delivery. Also, the author mentions they don't care about others as long as it doesn't affect them. However, making a derogatory comment in a group setting could create a hostile environment, even if it's just their opinion.\n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to express their opinion. The dining hall isn't a formal setting, so B's choice might be seen as out of place. But calling someone a pretentious idiot is a strong reaction. The key here is the manner of the comment. Insults, even if based on a personal opinion, can be inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering the context and the severity of the language used, the author likely overstepped. They might have a right to their opinion but expressed it in a way that was disrespectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
