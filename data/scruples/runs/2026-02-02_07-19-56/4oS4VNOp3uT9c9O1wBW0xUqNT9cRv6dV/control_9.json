      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who called their friend B a \"pretentious idiot\" is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're at a college dining hall. Friend A notices their mutual friend B wearing a full suit and tie. The user comments that B is a showoff and pretentious. Friend A then calls the user an asshole for that comment. The user is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about whether the user's comment was inappropriate. The user argues that wearing a suit in a casual setting like a dining hall is pretentious, but A thinks they were being mean.\n\nWell, in college, people have different styles. Some might dress more formally for various reasons\u2014maybe they just got out of class, or they like to express their style. The dining hall isn't a formal place, so wearing a suit there could be seen as unusual. But does that make B a showoff? That's subjective. The user's judgment is based on their own opinion, which is fine, but calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. It's an insult, even if it's based on personal dislike.\n\nFriend A probably thinks the user was being unnecessarily harsh, hence calling them an asshole. The user's reasoning is that they don't care about others as long as it doesn't affect them, but their comment was directed at B's choice of clothing, which is a personal style choice. Even if they don't care, making an insulting comment about someone else's appearance is likely to come off as rude.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong because they made a judgmental and insulting comment about someone else's style without considering that it's their personal choice. The fact that they were called an asshole by their friend suggests that their comment was inappropriate. The key point here is that personal style is subjective, and unless the clothing is causing harm or violating rules, it's not the user's place to criticize someone else's choice with such strong language.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong (A).\n"
