I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is in a college setting. The person (author) was eating with friend A, who points out friend B in a suit. The author comments that B is a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and friend A calls the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. College dining halls are usually casual places. Wearing a suit there might be seen as out of place by some. But does that justify calling someone a pretentious idiot? The key here is whether the comment was a personal attack or a critique of the attire.\n\nThe author's friend A defended B, saying the author was an asshole. The author argues they don't care about others' actions as long as it doesn't affect them, but they find the suit choice unbearable. So, the author is making a judgment based on their own opinion of what's appropriate. However, fashion is subjective. What one person sees as pretentious, another might see as a personal style choice.\n\nIs it wrong to voice such an opinion? Well, the comment is a direct insult (\"pretentious idiot\"), which could be seen as rude, even if the opinion is based on personal taste. Even if the author doesn't care about others' actions, the way they expressed their opinion might have been harsh. The friend A likely felt the comment was unkind, hence calling the author an asshole. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't in the wrong if they believe they have the right to express their opinion. However, the term \"pretentious idiot\" is a strong and potentially derogatory label. It's possible the author overstepped by not just stating their opinion but labeling B negatively. \n\nIn social norms, it's generally expected to avoid insults, even when expressing disagreement. So, even if the author's opinion is valid, the manner of expression could be the issue. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for the harsh language, even if the initial judgment is based on personal taste. So, answer A.\n"
