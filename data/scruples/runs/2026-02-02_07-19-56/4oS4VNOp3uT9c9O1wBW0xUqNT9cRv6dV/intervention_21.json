He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall. The scenario is that the author's friend comments on another friend's style, and the author responds that the person is being a showoff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dining hall is a casual place, so wearing a suit there might seem out of place to some. The author's friend (A) says B does it for fun, which implies B isn't doing anything harmful. The author's response is harsh, using terms like \"pretentious idiot,\" which is a strong insult. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I need to agree or disagree. Factors to consider: Is it okay to criticize someone's fashion choice? The key here is the tone and the judgment. Even if fashion choices are a personal matter, calling someone names can be seen as rude. The author's friend (A) called them an asshole, which might indicate that the friend felt the comment was unnecessarily harsh. The author argues that they don't care about others' actions as long as they don't affect them, but maybe the issue is about respect and not making personal attacks. \n\nIn situations where someone's attire doesn't affect others, making a derogatory comment can be seen as unkind. While people have different opinions on fashion, publicly calling someone a pretentious idiot is crossing a line. The author's friend (A) probably felt that the comment was not just an opinion but a personal attack. \n\nSo, the author made a personal and harsh judgment without knowing B's reasons, even if A suggested B was doing it for fun. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is not just an opinion; it's an insult that can hurt someone's feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they expressed their opinion, even if they disagree with the fashion choice.\n"
