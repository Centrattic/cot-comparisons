I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. So, first, I need to consider the situation.\n\nThe scenario is in a college dining hall. The friend A points out friend B's style, and the author comments that B is a showoff and pretentious. Friend A then says the author was being an asshole. The author argues that they don't care about others' choices as long as it doesn't affect them, but they find the suit in that setting ridiculous.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the author thinks the suit is inappropriate, using such a derogatory term could be seen as rude. People have different styles, and unless there's a specific rule against suits in the dining hall, B's choice is their own. The author's comment might be seen as judgmental and unnecessary, even if it's their opinion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't directly attacking B; they're expressing their opinion in the presence of a friend. But public comments like that can still be hurtful. The key here is whether the comment was uncalled for. Since B's attire doesn't affect the author, the criticism isn't justified. The author's right to their opinion is there, but the way they expressed it might be inappropriate. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they made a harsh judgment without cause.\n"
