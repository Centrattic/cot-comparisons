      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend B a \"pretentious idiot\" is in the wrong. So the situation is in a college dining hall where Friend A points out that Friend B is wearing a suit, and the author comments that B is being a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then says the author was an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around clothing. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't uncommon, especially if someone works in a formal profession or just likes the style. College students might wear suits for various reasons\u2014maybe it's part of their major, an interview, a club event, or just personal preference. The key here is whether the comment was justified.\n\nThe author called B a \"pretentious idiot\" based on the assumption that B was wearing the suit for fun, which the dining hall context might not require. Pretentiousness implies that B is trying to appear more important or knowledgeable than they are. But without knowing B's actual reason for wearing the suit, the author is making an assumption. That assumption could be incorrect. B might have a legitimate reason, like a job interview or a meeting, even if it's not typical for the dining hall.\n\nNext, the term \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the language used is quite strong. Calling someone an \"idiot\" is a personal attack, which can be seen as disrespectful. The author's friend A felt that the comment was unnecessary and that the author was being an asshole. Friend A's perspective is that the comment was out of line, which might indicate that the situation isn't as clear-cut as the author thinks.\n\nThe author claims not to care about others' actions as long as they don't affect them, but the comment was directed at B's choice. The issue here is that the author is publicly criticizing someone else's clothing choice, which could be seen as judgmental. Even if the author doesn't mind B's actions, making a derogatory comment about it affects the social dynamic. It's possible that the author overstepped by using such strong language and making a personal attack.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different styles and may choose to dress a certain way for personal reasons. The dining hall is a public space where people come and go with varying attire. If the author is uncomfortable with B's choice, the appropriate response might be to ignore it or perhaps ask B about their reasoning, rather than making a derogatory remark. The comment could be perceived as mean-spirited and unnecessary, especially if there's no prior issue between them.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's generally considered better to avoid making personal attacks, even if the subject is a minor one like clothing choices. The term \"pretentious\" can be subjective\u2014what one person sees as pretentious, another might see as a personal style. The author's judgment isn't based on any concrete evidence of B's intentions, just an assumption. This lack of evidence might make the comment unfounded.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's comment was likely inconsiderate and harsh. While people have the right to express their opinions, the way it was phrased with strong, negative language was probably uncalled for. There's no indication that B's actions were harmful or intrusive beyond the attire, so the response was disproportionate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the harsh judgment without knowing B's actual reason and for using offensive language.\n"
