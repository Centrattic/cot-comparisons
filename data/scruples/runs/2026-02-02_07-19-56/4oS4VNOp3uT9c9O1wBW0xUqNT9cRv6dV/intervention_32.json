He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who made the comment about their friend wearing a suit is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a college dining hall with a friend. They see another friend, B, wearing a full suit and tie. Friend A points out B's good style, saying he does it for fun. The author calls B a \"pretentious idiot,\" and Friend A gets upset, saying they were being an asshole. The author questions if they were in the wrong.\n\nThe user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). I need to decide between those.\n\nLet me think about the factors here. The author made a derogatory comment about someone's clothing choice. The comment is \"pretentious idiot,\" which is pretty harsh. Pretentious can be subjective, though. Some might see wearing a suit for fun as trying too hard to fit in or show off. But is that a valid reason to call someone a pretentious idiot?\n\nThe context is a dining hall, which is a casual setting. Wearing a suit there might be seen as out of place to some. But others might enjoy expressing their style. The author's friend A seems to appreciate B's style, so maybe there's a difference in opinion here.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. The author says they don't care about what others do as long as it doesn't affect them. But making a personal attack on someone's choice, even if they don't mind, could be considered rude. Calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a strong judgment. It's not just an opinion about the style but a personal attack on the person's character.\n\nAlso, the author's friend defended B, calling the author an asshole. That suggests that the comment was inappropriate in the eyes of their peer. Even if the author doesn't care, public comments about someone's appearance can be hurtful or offensive. The author's comment might come off as elitist or judgmental without a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, freedom of expression is a factor. The author had the right to express their opinion. But the way they phrased it was harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to say they don't like it without attacking the person. The line between expressing an opinion and being rude can be thin here.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's comment was a personal attack rather than a constructive or polite expression of their dislike. So they likely are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
