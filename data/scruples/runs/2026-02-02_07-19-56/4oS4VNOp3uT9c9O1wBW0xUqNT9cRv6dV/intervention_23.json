He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. The author is in college, and their friend A commented on friend B's style. The author then called B a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and friend A thought the author was being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Wearing a suit to a casual dining hall isn't against any rules, right? So, legally or by dress code, there's no issue. The author is upset because they find it showy. But is that enough to justify the insult?\n\nFriend A might have defended B by saying B does it for fun, which could imply that B isn't necessarily trying to show off but just enjoys the style. The author's response was to call B a \"pretentious idiot,\" which is a personal attack. Even if the author disagrees with the fashion choice, using such a strong insult could be seen as rude.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't care if others do things as long as it doesn't affect them. However, making a derogatory comment about someone else's appearance can affect the person being criticized, even if indirectly. It might make B feel targeted or hurt, even if the author isn't interacting with B directly.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are intent and the nature of the insult. The author's comment was a direct insult towards B's character, which is harsh. Even if the author's intention wasn't to harm, the language used is offensive. So, the author is probably in the wrong here because they crossed into personal criticism rather than just expressing an opinion without an insult.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. If the author is in a group where casual dress is the norm, B's suit could be seen as out of place. However, that doesn't justify calling someone a pretentious idiot. It's more about respecting others' choices. The author's response was combative, which might not be appropriate. So I think the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
