      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in a dining hall is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was with a friend A, who saw friend B in a suit. The author assumed B was wearing it just for fun, which A confirmed. Then the author called B a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and friend A said the author was being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Wearing a suit in a casual setting like a dining hall is unusual but not inherently wrong. People have different reasons for their clothing choices. The author made a judgment based on their own perception, thinking B was doing it for show. But maybe B had a different reason, even if it's just personal style.\n\nThen, the words used: \"pretentious idiot\" and \"showoff.\" Those are pretty harsh terms. Even if the author's intention was to express disapproval of the style choice, the language is quite strong. It's possible the author overreacted or used an unnecessarily rude comment. The question is whether the comment was justified.\n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that the comment was out of line. The author might have assumed negative intent without knowing B's actual reasons. Also, the dining hall isn't a formal setting, so the suit might seem out of place, but that doesn't make the person wrong for wearing it. People have the right to express themselves through clothing, even if others find it odd.\n\nThe author says they don't care about others' actions unless it affects them. In this case, the suit isn't affecting the author directly, so the criticism is more about personal taste. However, calling someone an idiot is a personal attack rather than a critique of the style. That's where the problem might be. The judgment crosses into being disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the comment was a straightforward opinion. But using such derogatory language in a public setting, even among friends, can be hurtful. The key here is whether the words were appropriate. \"Pretentious\" is a value judgment, and \"idiot\" is a personal insult. The line between expressing an opinion and being rude can be thin, but in this case, the wording seems to tip into being unkind.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction, while perhaps based on a personal opinion, was expressed in a way that was unnecessarily harsh and disrespectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
