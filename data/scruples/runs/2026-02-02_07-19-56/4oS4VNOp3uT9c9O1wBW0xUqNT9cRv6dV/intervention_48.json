      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a college student who called a friend's companion a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was eating with Friend A and saw Friend B wearing a suit. The author assumed B was wearing a suit for an interview or event, but A said B does it for fun. The author then called B a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and Friend A reacted negatively, saying the author was an asshole.\n\nThe main issue here is the judgment of someone's clothing choice. Wearing a suit in a casual setting like a dining hall might seem odd to some, but it's a matter of personal style. The author made an assumption about B's reason without knowing, which led to a derogatory comment. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh and offensive. Even if the author didn't like the outfit, the language used was disrespectful.\n\nFriend A's response that the author was an asshole suggests that the comment was out of line. The author's justification is that they don't care about others' actions as long as it doesn't affect them, but making a judgmental remark about someone's appearance can be hurtful and unnecessary. The dining hall is a public space, and people have different reasons for their attire. The author's reaction might be seen as impolite and judgmental, even if it's just their opinion.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) usually implies that the person is asking if their behavior was acceptable. In most cases, when someone criticizes another person's style in a private manner, especially with harsh language, it's considered the \"A\" (asshole) side. The key is whether the comment was meant to be critical or just a personal opinion. The use of \"pretentious idiot\" is a direct insult, not a constructive opinion.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author likely is in the wrong for using such a derogatory term without understanding B's reason. The answer should be A.\n"
