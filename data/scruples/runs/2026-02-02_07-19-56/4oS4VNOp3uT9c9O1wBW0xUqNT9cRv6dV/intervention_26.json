He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is in college, so the dining hall is a casual setting. Wearing a suit there might be unusual, and the friend A points out that B does it for fun. The author reacts by calling B a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then confronts the author about being an asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal style and freedom of expression. People have the right to dress however they want unless it's against specific rules. Even if the author finds it ridiculous, making a derogatory comment about someone's clothing choice could come off as judgmental and rude. The dining hall isn't a formal place, so B's attire might indeed seem out of place, but that doesn't justify the harsh language used. \n\nAlso, the author's friend A defended B by saying he does it for fun, implying that B isn't doing anything harmful. The author's reaction seems to be based on personal dislike rather than any actual harm. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty strong and could be seen as attacking B's character rather than just commenting on the outfit. \n\nHowever, the author argues they don't care about others' actions unless they affect them. But in this case, the comment was directed at B, even if it didn't affect the author directly. Publicly calling someone names, even if in a group, can be hurtful and disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, one could argue that the author was just expressing their opinion. But opinions can be shared without using offensive language. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is more of an insult than an opinion. So, the author might be in the wrong for using such a strong and derogatory term. \n\nIn summary, while the author might have a right to their opinion, the way they expressed it was unkind and unnecessary. The friend A's reaction is valid because the comment was harsh and disrespectful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
