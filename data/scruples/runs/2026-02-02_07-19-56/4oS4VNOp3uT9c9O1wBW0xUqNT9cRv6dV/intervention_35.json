I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who made the comment about someone wearing a suit being a \"pretentious idiot\" is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were at a college dining hall, and their friend A commented on friend B's style. The author noticed B was in a full suit and tie. The author assumed maybe B was coming from an interview or formal event, but A said B does it for fun. The author then called B a showoff and a \"pretentious idiot,\" and friend A called the author an asshole for that comment. The author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the dynamics here. \n\nIn social settings, especially in college, people have different styles and reasons for their clothing choices. The key point is whether the author's comment was justified. The author made an assumption that B was being pretentious without knowing B's actual reason. Even if A suggested B does it for fun, the author didn't verify the reason before passing judgment. \n\nCalling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a strong and derogatory term. It's an insult that can come off as disrespectful, regardless of the context. The author's comment might be seen as rude and judgmental, especially in a public setting like a dining hall. Even if the author doesn't care about others' actions as long as they don't affect them, the way they expressed their opinion was harsh and could be hurtful to B or embarrassing in front of others.\n\nFriend A's reaction of calling the author an asshole suggests that A felt the comment was uncalled for. The author's defense that they don't care about others' actions might not excuse the harshness of their words. Judging someone's style and using such language can create a hostile environment and isn't acceptable in most social settings unless there's a justified reason, which in this case, there isn't.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was likely inappropriate and disrespectful. They made an assumption without knowing the reason and used strong language. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
