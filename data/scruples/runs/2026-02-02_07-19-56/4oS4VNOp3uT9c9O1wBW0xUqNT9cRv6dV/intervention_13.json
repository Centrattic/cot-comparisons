He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation revolves around the author calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was with friend A, who pointed out friend B wearing a suit. The author comments that B is a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and friend A accuses them of being an asshole. The author doesn't care about others' choices unless it affects them, but they find the suit in a dining hall to be over the top.\n\nSo, the key points here are: public expression of judgment, the appropriateness of the comment, and the context of the situation. Wearing a suit in a college dining hall is unusual but not inherently wrong. People have different styles and reasons for their clothing choices. The author's reaction is a personal opinion, but labelling someone as a \"pretentious idiot\" could be seen as harsh and judgmental.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent, the impact of the words, and social norms. The author didn't confront friend B directly, so maybe it's a private comment. However, calling someone a pretentious idiot is a strong term that might come off as rude, even if it's their opinion.\n\nFriend A's reaction is also a factor. If the author's friend felt the comment was uncalled for, that suggests the author might have overstepped. The dining hall is a casual setting, so wearing formal attire might seem out of place to some, but others might appreciate the style. The author's judgment is subjective, but the language used is harsh.\n\nIn AITA forums, people usually get called out for public shaming or spreading negativity. Since the author is criticizing someone's appearance in a private conversation, it's still a judgmental comment. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is derogatory and might not be justified unless there's a clear context of B being intentionally showy. The author's right to their opinion exists, but the way they expressed it could be problematic.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong for using such language, even if their initial judgment is based on personal taste. The answer would be A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
