I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who called their friend B a \"pretentious idiot\" is in the wrong. The situation is that they were at a college dining hall, friend B was wearing a full suit and tie, and the author made a comment about it being showy and pretentious. Their friend A called them an asshole for that comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. College is a place where people express themselves in various ways, and fashion choices can be personal. Wearing a suit to a dining hall might be unusual, but is it wrong? The author's main issue is that they find it unbearable and eyeroll-worthy. But is it appropriate to call someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for that?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should consider if the comment was a valid critique or an insult. Calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a strong and derogatory term. Even if the author was annoyed, using such language could be seen as disrespectful. People have different styles, and while some might find it attention-seeking, it's not necessarily wrong. The author's friend A defended B, suggesting that the author overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they have the right to express their opinion. But the phrasing is harsh. The key is whether the comment was justified. Since there's no harm in B's choice unless it's causing actual issues, the author's reaction might be too strong. So, I think the author is in the wrong for the harsh language, making the answer A.\n"
