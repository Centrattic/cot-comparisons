He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend B a \"pretentious idiot\" is in the wrong. The situation is that they were in a college dining hall with friend A, who pointed out friend B wearing a suit, and the author made a derogatory comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's comment was appropriate. Wearing a suit in a casual setting like a dining hall isn't against any rules, so it's a matter of personal style. The author called B a pretentious idiot, which is pretty harsh. Even if they don't care about others' choices, directly insulting someone could be seen as rude. \n\nFriend A defended B, so the author's comment might have come off as judgmental. The key here is whether the comment was an honest opinion or an attack. While the author might have the right to their opinion, the way they expressed it as a public insult could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the context is a dining hall where people have different styles. The author's reaction might stem from personal dislike but doesn't justify calling someone an idiot. There's a difference between expressing an opinion and being disrespectful. \n\nSo, the author's comment was disrespectful, even if it's their opinion. Therefore, they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
