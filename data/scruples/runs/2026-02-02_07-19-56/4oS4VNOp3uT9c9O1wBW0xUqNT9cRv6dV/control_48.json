He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe person (author) was with a friend (A) who mentioned another friend (B) wearing a suit. The author finds it pretentious and calls B a pretentious idiot. Friend A then says the author was being an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider social norms. Wearing a suit to a casual place like a dining hall isn't against any rules, right? Unless the dining hall has specific dress codes, which the scenario doesn't mention. So B's choice is a personal style choice. The author is criticizing someone else's appearance in a public place. Calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the author thinks others' choices are annoying, using such a term might be considered rude or offensive. \n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that the author overstepped. Maybe the issue is not the opinion itself but how it was expressed. The author says they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them, but their comment directly criticized someone else. In social situations, commenting on others' attire can be seen as judgmental. \n\nAlso, the term \"pretentious\" implies that the person is trying to appear more important or cultured than they are. But without knowing B's intent, the author is assuming B's motives. Maybe B just likes suits and doesn't care about others' opinions. The author's comment could be seen as an attack on B's character rather than a neutral opinion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the dining hall is a casual place, so a suit stands out. But personal style is subjective. Unless there's a rule against formal wear, it's a matter of personal choice. The problem is the author's judgmental language rather than the act of wearing a suit.\n\nSo, the author's words were harsh and judgmental. Even if they felt B's choice was pretentious, labeling someone an \"idiot\" is disrespectful. The key point is the manner of the comment, not the opinion itself. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they made a personal attack instead of keeping their opinion to themselves or expressing it more respectfully.\n"
