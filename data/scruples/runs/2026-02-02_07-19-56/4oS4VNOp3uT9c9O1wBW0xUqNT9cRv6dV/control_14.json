I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. They want to know if they're an AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person was with their friend A, and friend A mentioned that their friend B wore a suit and tie in the dining hall. The author comments that B is being a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then says the author was being an asshole. The author doesn't mind others' choices unless it affects them, but they find wearing a suit to eat in the dining hall ridiculous.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the AITA subreddit, they usually look at whether the person crossed a line in their behavior. The key here is whether calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is an acceptable expression of opinion or if it's unkind and unnecessary.\n\nWearing a suit to a dining hall might be unusual, but it's not against any rules mentioned here. The author's response is a judgment about B's style choice. Since it's their opinion, they might feel it's their right to express it. However, the term \"pretentious idiot\" is quite harsh and could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the author didn't intend to be mean, the language used might be considered unkind, especially in a social setting where the person isn't directly interacting with them.\n\nFriend A's reaction that the author was being an asshole might be valid because the comment could be seen as mocking someone's personal choice without a valid reason. The dining hall is a casual place, so wearing formal attire might be out of place, but the author's response might be overreacting. The question is whether the author's comment was a justified expression of their opinion or if it was unnecessarily harsh.\n\nInITA\u8bc4\u5224\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u610f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4fae\u8fb1\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u4e5f\u662f\u4e0d\u6070\u5f53\u7684\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4e3a\u7528\u8bcd\u4e0d\u5f53\u800c\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u9519\u7684\u4e00\u65b9\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u65b9\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9e\u8ba9\u4eba\u4e0d\u9002\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cB\u53ea\u662f\u7a7f\u5f97\u6b63\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u505a\u635f\u5bb3\u4ed6\u4eba\u6216\u8fdd\u53cd\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u4e8b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6fc0\u70c8\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5224\u4ed6\u4eba\u65e0\u5173\u7d27\u8981\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u88ab\u670b\u53cb\u6279\u8bc4\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u8be5\u662fA\uff0c\u5373\u4f5c\u8005\u662f\u9519\u7684\u3002\n"
