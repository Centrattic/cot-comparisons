      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall. The context is that the author was with their friend A, who pointed out friend B wearing a suit. The author then called B a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and friend A said the author was being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. College dining halls are casual places, so wearing a full suit might stand out. The author's main issue seems to be that they find it pretentious. But is that a valid reason to insult someone?\n\nThe key points here are intent and the nature of the comment. The author made a direct negative comment about someone else's appearance. Even if they don't care about what others do, making a derogatory remark in front of someone else (even a friend) can be hurtful. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty strong and could be seen as personal and judgmental.\n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that the comment was out of line, at least in their view. The author's justification is that they don't mind others' actions unless they affect them, but the act of publicly criticizing someone's style might still be considered rude. Even if it's just among friends, the author's words could have embarrassed or offended friend B.\n\nAlso, considering the college environment, people often express themselves through fashion. What one person sees as pretentious, another might see as self-expression. The author's judgmental attitude might be the issue here. The question is whether the comment was a harmless opinion or an unkind attack.\n\nSo, while the author might not be \"in the wrong\" legally, socially, the comment could be seen as disrespectful. The answer hinges on whether the criticism is constructive or just a hurtful remark without cause. Since the author didn't have evidence that B was trying to show off, their judgment is speculative and potentially harsh. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the harshness of the comment and the lack of constructive intent.\n"
