He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. They provided a scenario where their friend (A) comments on another friend (B) wearing a suit, and the author responds by calling B a showoff and pretentious idiot. Friend A then says the author was an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dining hall is a casual place, so wearing a suit might seem out of place to some. But people have different reasons for their clothing choices. The author's friend A says B does it for fun, which implies B isn't in a formal event. The author finds this pretentious and calls B a \"pretentious idiot.\"\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Public shaming or making derogatory comments about someone's appearance can be hurtful, even if it's not directed at you. The author's comment is dismissive and judgmental. Even if the author doesn't care about others' choices, publicly labeling someone as pretentious might come off as rude. The friend A thought the author was being an asshole, which is a strong reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they're just expressing their opinion. But the term \"pretentious idiot\" is harsh and could make B feel targeted. The situation might have been handled better with a more neutral comment, like \"That's an unusual choice,\" instead of a derogatory term.\n\nAlso, in a college setting, people often have varied styles, and what's considered pretentious by one person might be a personal choice for another. The key here is the manner of the comment. Calling someone an idiot, even if it's a label they don't agree with, is definitely crossing a line.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's comment was harsh and disrespectful. They might not have intended to be mean, but the language used was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
