He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" because that person wore a suit to the dining hall. The situation is in a college setting, so maybe the person in the suit is trying to stand out or make a statement.\n\nFirst, the user's friend A points out friend B's style, and the user reacts negatively. The key here is whether the comment was justified. The user says they don't care about others unless it affects them, but they find the suit in a casual setting like a dining hall to be over the top. \n\nNow, calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the user didn't mean it personally, the language used is offensive. The user might feel that the suit is inappropriate, but everyone has different fashion choices. The dining hall isn't a formal place, so maybe the user thinks that's unnecessary. However, the right to self-expression includes what people wear. \n\nThe user's friend A called them an asshole, which suggests that the friend thought the comment was uncalled for. The user's justification is that they don't mind others unless it affects them, but making a derogatory comment about someone's appearance does affect the social environment. It's possible the user overstepped by mocking someone else's style choice, even if they don't agree with it.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel that the suit is a show of pretension in an informal setting. But using such a strong term could be seen as disrespectful. The line between expressing an opinion and being derogatory is thin here. \n\nConsidering all that, the user's comment was probably unnecessary and offensive, so they might be in the wrong. But if they're not in any professional environment where formal attire is expected, maybe their frustration is understandable. However, the term used is harsh, so the answer might lean towards AITA being the user's fault.\n"
