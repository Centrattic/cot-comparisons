He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made the comment is in the wrong. The situation is that they were at a college dining hall, saw a friend's friend wearing a suit, and called him a \"pretentious idiot.\" Their friend said they were being an asshole, but the person doesn't care as long as it doesn't affect them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if using derogatory language like \"pretentious idiot\" is acceptable. Even if someone's choice of clothing isn't affecting anyone, calling them names can be hurtful. The dining hall is a public space, and people have different styles. Maybe the friend was expressing themselves, and the comment was a judgment without understanding.\n\nBut the person argues that they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them. However, making such a comment in front of others might make the situation uncomfortable for the person being commented on or others. Even if it's not a direct confrontation, it's still a judgmental remark.\n\nOn the other hand, freedom of expression allows people to have opinions. But the harshness of the words might cross into being disrespectful. The friend called them an asshole, which suggests that the friend felt the comment was out of line. The person might not be in the wrong, but their choice of words was inappropriate. Maybe they should have expressed their opinion without using such strong language.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because the language used was harsh and judgmental, even if the opinion itself is subjective. However, some might argue that they're not in the wrong for expressing their opinion. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and the comment was disrespectful, the answer could be A.\n"
