He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about someone criticizing another person for wearing a suit in a casual setting like a dining hall.\n\nFirst, the author called their friend B a \"pretentious idiot\" because B was wearing a suit. The friend A defended B, saying he does it for fun, and the author's friend A called the author an asshole. The author is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points: The author made a derogatory comment about someone's clothing choice. The context is a college dining hall, which is a casual place. Wearing a suit there might be seen as trying to stand out. The author's reasoning is that it's pretentious and they don't care about others as long as it doesn't affect them. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. In terms of social norms, criticizing someone's fashion choice can be seen as rude, especially if it's a personal attack. Calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a harsh judgment. Even if the author personally finds it annoying, making a derogatory comment towards someone else's style is likely to be seen as insensitive or disrespectful. \n\nFriend A stepping in suggests that the comment was out of line. The dining hall is a public space, and people have different reasons for their attire. The author's comment could come off as judgmental without considering other perspectives. Even if the author doesn't mind the behavior, directly insulting someone is not acceptable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did overstep by using a harsh insult without knowing the full context of why B was wearing the suit. There's a lack of empathy and understanding here. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
