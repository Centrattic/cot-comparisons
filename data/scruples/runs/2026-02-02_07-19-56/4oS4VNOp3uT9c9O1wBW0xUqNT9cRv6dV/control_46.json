He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in a dining hall. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The author was with their friend A, who pointed out their mutual friend B wearing a suit. The author thought B was being a showoff and called him a pretentious idiot. Friend A then said the author was being an asshole.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the user is asking for an AITA judgment. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" so the options are A (yes, the author is the asshole) or B (no).\n\nThe key here is whether the author's comment was justified. Wearing a suit in a dining hall isn't against any rules, so it's a matter of personal choice. The author didn't like it and made a judgmental comment. Using strong language like \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. People have different styles, and unless it's affecting the author, criticizing someone for their clothing choice might be considered rude or judgmental. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of freedom of expression. The author might feel that the comment was just their opinion. However, the term \"pretentious idiot\" is derogatory and could be seen as an attack on B's character rather than a disagreement on fashion. \n\nFriend A's reaction says the author was an asshole, which suggests the comment was inappropriate. The author's reasoning is that it's just their opinion as long as it doesn't affect them. But making a public judgment like that, even if it's not directed at them, can be seen as intrusive or rude. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often considers intent and impact. The impact here was that the author's friend called them an asshole, so the impact was negative. The intent was to express a personal dislike, but the harsh language crossed a line. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they used a derogatory term to judge someone's personal choice without any harmful consequence to themselves. So the answer would be A.\n"
