He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario involves friends A and B, and the author.\n\nFirst, the context is a college dining hall. Friend A points out that their friend B is wearing a full suit and tie, and the author responds by calling B a \"pretentious idiot.\" The author's friend A then says the author was being an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is commenting on someone's clothing choice in this context unkind or wrong? Let's consider social norms. Wearing a suit to a casual place like a dining hall is unusual, but it's not against any rules. People have different styles. The author's comment was a judgment and an insult, which could be seen as rude. Even if the author doesn't care about others' choices, directly calling someone a negative name is harsh.\n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that the comment was inappropriate. While everyone has the right to express their opinion, doing so in a way that attacks the person's character (calling them an idiot) crosses into personal criticism. The author's comment was not just an opinion about the clothing but a judgment on B's intentions and personality. That's where the problem lies. Even if the author finds it annoying, the response was mean-spirited without a valid reason. So, the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
