He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. The situation is in a college setting where the person, let's call them the author, made that comment. Their friend A defended friend B, saying the author was an asshole. The author doesn't mind others doing what they want as long as it doesn't affect them, but they find the suit wearing to be showy.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author's comment was justified or if they overstepped. Wearing a suit in a casual setting like a dining hall is a personal choice. People might have different reasons for doing it\u2014maybe they like the way it looks, it's comfortable for them, or they're expressing their style. The author calls B a \"pretentious idiot,\" which is a strong and derogatory term. Pretentious usually means trying to appear more important or impressive than one is. But is that accurate here?\n\nThe author's friend A suggests that B might just enjoy wearing suits for fun, so maybe there's no underlying pretentiousness. The author's judgment is based on their own opinion of the situation, assuming B is trying to show off. However, without knowing B's actual reasons, the author is making an assumption. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is not just an opinion on style but a personal attack on B's character, which could be hurtful even if it's not intended that way.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't care about others' choices as long as it doesn't affect them. But they do have a strong negative reaction. The line between expressing a personal opinion and being disrespectful can be thin. Using such a harsh label might be crossing that line, even if the author is just sharing their thoughts. The friend A's reaction that the author was an asshole suggests that their comment was inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the context of a college setting where people often experiment with style and self-expression. Dismissing someone's choice as pretentious could be seen as dismissive of their individuality. Unless there's a clear rule against formal attire in the dining hall, which isn't mentioned, it's a personal style choice. The author's right to their opinion doesn't negate the potential harm in the way it's expressed.\n\nIn summary, while the author has the right to their opinion, the specific choice of words and the judgmental nature of the comment about someone's clothing in a public space where it's allowed might place the onus on the author for being in the wrong. The term used is harsh and assumes negative intent without evidence. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
