I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who made the comment is in the wrong. The situation is that they were with a friend who commented on another friend wearing a suit to the dining hall. The user called the other person a \"pretentious idiot\" for doing so, and their friend said they were an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is in college, and the dining hall is a casual place. Wearing a suit there might be seen as unusual or trying to show off. The user's comment was harsh, calling someone a pretentious idiot. That's pretty strong language. The friend A defended the person, saying they wear it for fun, not necessarily for an event. Then the user's friend says the user was being an asshole.\n\nI should think about whether the user overstepped. Insulting someone for their clothing choice, even if they're not directly affected by it, can come off as judgmental. The dining hall isn't a formal setting, so wearing a suit might be seen as not fitting the environment. But does that make the person pretentious? The user might feel that it's unnecessary, but calling someone an idiot is pretty harsh. \n\nAlso, the user mentions they don't care about others' actions unless it affects them. So maybe they felt that the suit-wearer was drawing unnecessary attention, but the user's response was mean-spirited. The problem here is the language used rather than the opinion itself. It's about how they expressed their opinion. Insulting someone's style choices can be seen as disrespectful, even if the person isn't directly bothered by it. \n\nFriend A's reaction is important. If the user's friend called them an asshole, that might indicate that the comment was indeed inappropriate. The user's friend might see the comment as uncalled for, even if they don't necessarily agree with the other person's style. So the user's wording crossed into insulting territory, making them in the wrong for being rude about someone's fashion choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, meaning the user is in the wrong.\n"
