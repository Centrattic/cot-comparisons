He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is from a college setting where a friend comments on another friend's style, and the author responds by calling them showy and pretentious. The friend then accuses the author of being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't necessarily against any rules, so it's a matter of personal choice. The key here is whether the comment was justified or if it crossed a line into being disrespectful. The author's friend, A, defended B, saying he does it for fun. The author's response was to label B as a \"pretentious idiot,\" which is a strong and derogatory term.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and respect. People often express different opinions about fashion, but calling someone a name in public, even among friends, can be hurtful. The author's statement was not just a disagreement but a personal attack. The dining hall is a casual environment, so wearing formal attire might be seen as out of place by some, but that's subjective. The author's reaction might be seen as judgmental and lacking in empathy towards personal expression.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't care about others' choices unless it affects them, but their reaction here does affect the person being criticized. Even if it's verbal and not physical, the words can impact someone's feelings. The friend A's response that the author was an asshole suggests that the comment was socially inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether their reaction was proportional and respectful. Using a derogatory term like \"pretentious idiot\" is more about putting down someone's character rather than discussing style differences. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they made a personal attack instead of a respectful critique.\n"
