      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is from a college setting. The person (let's call them the author) was with a friend who noticed another friend wearing a suit and tie. The author comments that this guy is being a showoff and a pretentious idiot. The friend then says the author was being an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no (author isn't wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. Wearing a suit in a dining hall might be seen as formal, but is it pretentious? The author's friend A says the comment was harsh. The author's reasoning is that if someone isn't in a formal event or interview, wearing a suit there is just for show, hence pretentious. \n\nNow, considering social norms, people can choose their clothing, and unless there's a dress code, it's their choice. However, the author's comment is derogatory. Calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty strong. Even if the author thinks the clothing choice is unnecessary, the name-calling might be the issue here. \n\nBut then, the author also says they don't care what others do as long as it doesn't affect them. So maybe their problem is with the show-off aspect, not the clothing itself. But the language used is the key point here. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be wrong because they made a judgment based on someone's attire and labeled them negatively. However, if the author is just expressing their opinion without intending harm, maybe not. But public shaming or derogatory terms can be seen as uncivil. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction suggests that the comment was harsh. So, the friend A thinks the author was being an asshole. The question is whether the author's comment is justified. \n\nI think the key is the term \"pretentious idiot.\" Even if the clothing choice is questionable, calling someone an idiot is a strong insult. The author might be in the wrong for using such language. However, if the author is just being honest, maybe not. \n\nBut in terms of social etiquette, it's generally better to avoid name-calling. So the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. However, if the opinion is that clothing choices shouldn't be criticized, then the author is wrong. If the opinion is that the term used is too harsh, then AITA is yes. \n\nAnother angle: the author's friend B is the one wearing the suit. The author's comment is a personal opinion, but the phrasing is offensive. So the issue is the manner of expression, not the opinion itself. So maybe the author is wrong for the way they expressed it, not the content. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (yes, the author is wrong) because they used harsh language to express their opinion, which can be seen as attacking the person rather than critiquing the action. Even if the opinion is held, the way it's delivered is inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
