He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall. The scenario is that they were with a friend, saw another friend in a suit, and the author made a comment about them being showy and pretentious. The friend then called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person in the suit is at a college dining hall, which isn't a formal setting. Wearing a suit there might be seen as unusual, but maybe that person just likes to dress that way. The author's comment is pretty harsh\u2014calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty direct and disrespectful. Even if the author thinks it's just their opinion, the way they phrased it could be seen as attacking the other person's character rather than just criticizing the choice.\n\nBut then again, people have different fashion senses. Maybe the person in the suit isn't doing anything wrong by their choice of clothing. The author is making a judgment based on their own standards. The question is whether that judgment is justified. In terms of social norms, criticizing someone's appearance can be seen as rude, especially if it's not affecting others. The author says they don't care about others' actions as long as it doesn't affect them, which is true, but public criticism can still be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the friend A called the author an asshole, which suggests that even the friend thought the comment was out of line. The author might have overstepped by making a personal attack instead of a more neutral comment. So, even if the author feels the clothing choice is pretentious, the way they expressed it was inappropriate. That would put them in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong if they believe that making personal comments in a social setting is acceptable. But generally, people are expected to respect others' choices unless it's harmful. So, the answer could be A, the author is in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here because it's a personal opinion, but the harshness of the language matters.\n"
