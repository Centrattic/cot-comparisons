I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in a dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person (the author) was eating with a friend who noticed another friend (B) wearing a full suit. The author comments that B is being a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and their friend accuses them of being an asshole. The author is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's reasoning is that wearing a suit in a casual dining hall is over the top and pretentious. But is it appropriate to call someone an \"idiot\" for their clothing choice? Even if someone's style seems out of place, using such a harsh term could be seen as offensive. The dining hall is a public space, and people can dress as they like unless there's a dress code. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they don't care about others' choices as long as it doesn't affect them. But making a derogatory comment about someone's appearance, even if not directed at them, can be hurtful. Friend B might feel targeted or embarrassed if they overhear, even if the comment was made to someone else. \n\nHowever, the context is a casual college setting where people often dress informally. Wearing a suit might stand out, but that doesn't make it wrong. The author's friend A thinks the author was an asshole, which suggests that using such language in a social group might be frowned upon. The term \"pretentious\" implies that B is trying to appear more cultured or wealthy than they are, but without knowing B's motives, it's an assumption. \n\nAlso, the author's comment could be seen as judgmental and lacking in empathy. Everyone has different reasons for their choices. Maybe B is confident in their style, or it's part of their identity. The author's reaction might come off as elitist or dismissive. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while people are free to dress however they want, publicly criticizing someone's appearance can be seen as rude. The key here is whether the comment was necessary. The author could have expressed their opinion without insulting B. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's use of \"pretentious idiot\" is a harsh judgment that doesn't consider B's perspective and may be unnecessarily derogatory. Even if the author didn't mean to be mean, the language used crosses a line. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
