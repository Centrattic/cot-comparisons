He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who called someone else a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author was eating with a friend when they saw another friend wearing a suit. The author's friend comments on the style, and the author responds by calling the person a \"pretentious idiot\" for doing it just for fun. The friend then says the author was an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal style choices and public judgment. The author is criticizing someone else's fashion choice, which is something subjective. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't against any dress code, so it's a personal choice. The author finds it showy and pretentious, but others might see it as a personal expression. \n\nThe question is whether the author's comment was unkind or unnecessary. Even if the author doesn't care about others' actions, publicly labeling someone as pretentious can be seen as disrespectful. People often have different reasons for their choices, and making a derogatory comment without knowing the context (like maybe the person likes that style, or it's comfortable for them) could be hasty. \n\nAlso, the author's friend called them out, which suggests that maybe the comment was out of line socially. While the author might not be \"in the wrong\" in a strict sense, it's more about social etiquette. If the question is about whether they acted wrongly by being judgmental and using harsh language, then yes, their comment was unkind and potentially hurtful. \n\nSo, considering that, I think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they judged someone else's harmless choice and used a derogatory term, which isn't necessary unless it's causing harm. Even if the author doesn't care about others' actions, the way they reacted was inappropriate.\n"
