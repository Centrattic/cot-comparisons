I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author was eating with a friend when they noticed another friend (B) wearing a full suit and tie in the dining hall. The friend (A) comments that B has good style, and the author responds by calling B a \"pretentious idiot\" for doing it for fun. Friend A then says the author was an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal style choices and public judgment. In college, people often express themselves through their clothing, and while some might find a suit in a dining hall out of place, others might see it as a personal choice. The author's comment was direct and derogatory, which could be seen as rude or judgmental. \n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that they found the author's comment harsh. The author's justification is that they don't care about others unless it affects them, but they still made a judgment based on appearance. The question is whether that judgment was unkind or crossing a line.\n\nSociety generally values individual expression, so unless there's a specific rule against suits in the dining hall, B's choice is their own. The author's use of \"pretentious idiot\" is a strong term, implying that B is trying to impress others in a way that's insincere. Whether that's fair depends on B's intent, which isn't clear. The author assumed intent without knowing, which could be a misstep.\n\nHowever, the author isn't directly harming B, just expressing their opinion. But the tone and wording might be considered disrespectful. So, is the author in the wrong? If the argument is about being judgmental and using harsh language without knowing the context, then A (yes). If it's about freedom of expression and not being affected, then B (no). \n\nBut typically, in such scenarios, being judgmental towards others' style choices, especially with derogatory terms, is seen as the wrong move. The author's friend called them an asshole, which might indicate that the social norm here is against such a comment. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
