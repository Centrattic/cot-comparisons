He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author called a classmate a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to the dining hall. The friend thought the comment was harsh, but the author didn't care as long as it didn't affect them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are: the friend A noticed B wearing a suit, commented on his style, and the author reacted negatively. The dining hall is a casual place, so wearing a suit there might be seen as out of place. But is it pretentious? That's subjective.\n\nThe author's comment was \"pretentious idiot,\" which is pretty strong. The question is whether that's an appropriate response. Even if someone's style is unusual, calling them names is rude. The author might be in the wrong for being judgmental and using harsh language. However, the friend A thought the author was being an asshole, which suggests others might see the comment as uncalled for.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. I should consider if the author overstepped. Public shaming or judgment without knowing the reason (like maybe B has a reason for wearing the suit) isn't fair. The author didn't ask why B was dressed that way but made an assumption and a derogatory comment. That's probably not acceptable. So the answer would be A.\n"
