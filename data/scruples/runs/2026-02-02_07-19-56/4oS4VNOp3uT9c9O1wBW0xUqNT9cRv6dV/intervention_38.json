I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called someone else a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in a college dining hall is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person (Author) is in a dining hall with their friend A. Friend A points out their friend B wearing a suit, and A says B does it for fun. The Author responds by calling B a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A then tells the Author they were being an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are about personal style choices and public reactions. Wearing a suit in a casual setting like a dining hall is a personal choice. The Author's criticism is about B's style, calling them pretentious. Pretentiousness is subjective; some might see it as trying too hard to appear sophisticated, while others might appreciate the style.\n\nThe dining hall is a public space where people can wear what they like. The Author's comment is a personal opinion, but calling someone an \"idiot\" is harsh and derogatory. Even if the Author thinks it's just their opinion, using such strong language can come off as disrespectful. The fact that the Author's own friend called them an asshole suggests that the tone was inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the Author might argue that they're just expressing their view and that B's choice doesn't affect them. But in social interactions, especially in public, people should be mindful of their words. Insulting someone for their style choices can be seen as judgmental and rude, regardless of the setting.\n\nAlso, the distinction between \"showoff\" and \"pretentious idiot\" is important. While pointing out someone's style as showy is one thing, labeling them with an insult crosses a line. The Author's comment wasn't just an opinion but a personal attack.\n\nIn conclusion, even though people have the right to their opinions, the way the Author expressed it\u2014using derogatory language\u2014makes them at fault. The answer would be Yes, the Author is in the wrong.\n"
