He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in a dining hall is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person in question was eating with a friend when they noticed another friend wearing a full suit and tie. The original poster (OP) made a derogatory comment, and their friend called them an asshole. The dining hall is a casual setting, so wearing a suit there is unusual. \n\nNow, the key points here are the OP's right to express their opinion versus being disrespectful. The suit-wearing person isn't causing harm, just choosing to dress formally. The OP's comment was an insult, which could be seen as crossing a line from expressing an opinion to being rude. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people have the right to wear what they want unless it's against rules. The dining hall likely doesn't have a dress code, so B's choice isn't violating any rules. The OP's judgment might be based on personal dislike, but calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a personal attack, not just a critique of the clothing. \n\nAlso, the friend (A) reacted negatively, indicating that the comment was unkind. The OP's justification is that they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them, but making a derogatory comment does affect the person being criticized, even if indirectly. \n\nSo, while the OP might feel strongly about the choice, the language used was harsh and disrespectful. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a personal attack without a valid reason beyond personal dislike."
