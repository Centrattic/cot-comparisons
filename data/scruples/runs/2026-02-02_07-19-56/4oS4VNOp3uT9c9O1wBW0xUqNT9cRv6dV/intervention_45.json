He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" because they wore a suit to the dining hall. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author was with their friend A, who points out friend B wearing a suit. The author then calls B a \"pretentious idiot\" for showing off, and friend A gets upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the comment was appropriate. Wearing a suit to a casual place like a dining hall might be seen as overdressed, but is it pretentious? The author's friend A thinks the comment was harsh, calling the author an asshole. \n\nThe author defends their stance by saying they don't care about others' choices unless it affects them. But the dining hall is a public space, and people have different styles. The problem is the author made a judgmental comment about someone else's clothing choice. \n\nPretentiousness is subjective. What one person sees as pretentious, another might see as a personal style choice. The author might not have the authority to judge that. Also, using a derogatory term like \"idiot\" is clearly harsh. Even if the author was annoyed, calling someone that could be seen as mean-spirited, especially in a college setting where people have different backgrounds and fashion senses.\n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that the comment was offensive. The author's friend might have a different view on what's appropriate to say about someone's appearance. Also, the dining hall isn't a formal setting, so B's attire might be unusual, but that doesn't justify the author's harsh words.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's generally better to avoid making negative comments about others' clothing unless it's a specific context where attire matters (like a formal event). Here, the dining hall is casual, so B's suit stands out. However, the author's response was personal and insulting, which is where the issue lies.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author made a judgmental and insulting remark without considering others' perspectives. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is an attack on B's character rather than a neutral observation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
