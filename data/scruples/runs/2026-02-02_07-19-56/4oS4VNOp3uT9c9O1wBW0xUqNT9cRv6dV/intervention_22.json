I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" because that person wore a suit to the dining hall. The situation is in a college setting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's friend A points out that their friend B has good style, but the author gets annoyed when B is wearing a full suit and tie in a casual dining hall. The author calls B a showoff and a \"pretentious idiot,\" and friend A is upset with the author for being an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's break it down. Wearing a suit in a dining hall isn't against any rules, right? So B is within their right to dress that way. But the author finds it unbearable and pretentious. Is it okay to make a derogatory comment about someone's fashion choice?\n\nPeople have different styles. Some might prefer formal clothes even in casual settings. Calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if the author thinks it's pretentious, using such strong language could be seen as rude. The key here is whether the comment was justified. The author's friend A disagrees, calling the author an asshole, which suggests that maybe the comment was out of line.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't care as long as it doesn't affect them, but criticizing someone's style in a public setting can be seen as intrusive. It's one thing to have an opinion, another to express it in a way that's offensive. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is a personal attack rather than a constructive comment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the suit is inappropriate for the setting. But the dining hall isn't a formal place, so maybe B is trying to stand out or express themselves. The author's reaction is more about their own discomfort with the other person's choice rather than any actual harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong. They made a harsh comment about someone else's clothing, which is a personal choice. Even if the author finds it pretentious, the language used is offensive. Friend A's reaction supports the idea that the comment was uncalled for. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
