      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend B a \"pretentious idiot\" is in the wrong. The situation is in a college dining hall where friend B was wearing a full suit and tie. The user's friend A thinks B's style is good, and the user retorts by calling B a showoff and using the term \"pretentious idiot.\" Friend A then tells the user they were being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In a college setting, people often express themselves through their clothing. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't uncommon; some might do it for interviews, meetings, or just for fun. The user's friend B might be doing it for the latter. The user's reaction is based on their own perception that it's showy and pretentious. But is that a valid reason to call someone that?\n\nThe user's comment was directed at someone in their presence (friend A) when commenting on friend B. Even if they don't care about others' actions, publicly calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" could be seen as rude. The key here is whether the comment was justified. If the user felt B was being pretentious, but maybe there's a misunderstanding. For example, B could be in a club event or just likes formal wear. The user's judgment might be based on their own assumptions without knowing the reason. \n\nFriend A defended B, so the user's comment might have come across as harsh. Even if the user doesn't care about others' choices, the way they expressed their opinion could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is strong and could be offensive, regardless of the situation. \n\nHowever, people have the right to express their opinions about others' style. The user's issue is that they find it unbearable and eyerolling, which is a personal dislike. But labeling someone as an idiot is crossing the line. The user's friend A thinks they were an asshole, which suggests that the comment was inappropriate. \n\nSo, while the user might have a right to their opinion, the manner in which they expressed it is problematic. The term used is derogatory and could be seen as the user's fault. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
