I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit to a dining hall is in the wrong. The scenario is in a college setting. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person (author) is in a dining hall with a friend. They see another friend (B) wearing a full suit and tie. The friend (A) comments that B has good style, but the author interprets it as B wearing the suit \"for fun,\" implying that B is showing off. The author calls B a \"pretentious idiot,\" and friend A then accuses the author of being an asshole. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's comment was made in a social setting, possibly in front of others. The clothing choice (suit in a dining hall) is seen as something that might be considered out of place or ostentatious. The author's response is a direct insult, which could be seen as unkind, even if they don't care about others' actions otherwise.\n\nNow, considering social norms: in many college campuses, people wear various styles, and some might choose to wear formal attire as a personal expression. However, commenting on someone else's clothing in a derogatory way, even in a group setting, can come off as judgmental and disrespectful. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is quite harsh and might not be an appropriate response to someone's fashion choice, especially if it doesn't affect the person directly. \n\nThe friend A's reaction suggests that the comment was out of line, which could imply that the author overstepped. The dining hall is a public space, and while people have the right to dress how they want, the author's right to comment on that might be limited, especially if it's done in a hurtful manner. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they don't care about others' actions as long as it doesn't affect them. However, public behavior can sometimes affect others' perceptions or create a less welcoming environment, even if not directly interfering. The key here is intent versus impact. The author's intent was to express their opinion, but the impact was a derogatory comment that could be offensive to the person wearing the suit and possibly others.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is a direct insult. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the words chosen are harsh and judgmental. The situation doesn't seem to involve any harm beyond personal expression, so the author's response is more about their personal dislike rather than a justified criticism. \n\nAdditionally, the author's friend (A) taking their side or not is a factor. If the friend A felt that the comment was inappropriate, it might indicate that the author's reaction was excessive. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while people have the right to their opinions, the way the author expressed their opinion was unkind and potentially hurtful. The dining hall is a public space where diverse fashion choices are common, and the author's reaction might not be justified. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for making such a harsh comment about someone else's personal style choice, especially in a public setting where it could affect others' feelings.\n"
