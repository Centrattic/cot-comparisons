      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for calling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" because they wore a suit to the dining hall. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author was with friend A at the dining hall. Friend A points out friend B wearing a full suit and tie and comments that B has good style. The author notices that B might have just come from an interview or formal event. Friend A says B does it for fun. The author then calls B a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Friend A thinks the author was being an asshole. The author says they don't care about others' choices unless it affects them, but they find the suit in a casual setting unbearable and eye-rolling.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's comment was wrong. Let's consider factors like intent, context, and appropriateness of the language used. \n\nFirst, the comment itself: \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. The term \"pretentious\" implies that B is trying to appear more sophisticated than they are, but the author's argument is that wearing a suit in a casual setting is showy. However, if B is wearing a suit for their own reasons\u2014maybe a personal style choice\u2014it might not be pretentious. The author assumes intent without knowing B's reasons. That could be an assumption.\n\nSecond, the setting: a college dining hall is usually casual. Wearing a suit might stand out, but people have different fashion preferences. Some might prefer more formal attire even in informal places. The author's reaction is based on their dislike of that choice. However, making a judgment and calling someone names could be seen as rude.\n\nThird, the author's justification is that they don't care about others unless it affects them, but they find it unbearable. That's their personal opinion, but expressing it as a personal attack on B's character might be crossing a line. It's one thing to dislike a style, another to insult someone for it.\n\nFriend A's reaction suggests that the comment was harsh. The author's friend felt the author was being an asshole, which indicates that even among peers, the response was seen as inappropriate.\n\nAlso, using \"idiot\" is a strong term. Even if the author felt B was being showy, the specific choice of words could be more offensive than necessary. Maybe a more constructive or less personal comment would be better.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, the author is sharing their opinion in a social setting where friends are discussing others. It's possible that the context was casual, and the author felt it was acceptable. But when it comes to respecting others' choices, even if they differ from our own, there's a line between expressing an opinion and being disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of social norms, criticizing someone's appearance can be seen as judgmental. Unless the attire is causing harm, it's usually considered more polite to avoid harsh criticism. The author's comment targets B's character (\"pretentious idiot\") rather than just stating a dislike for the outfit.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's comment was likely in the wrong because it was a personal attack based on a judgment of another's style choice without knowing their reasons, and the language used was unnecessarily harsh. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
