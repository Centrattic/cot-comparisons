      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit at the dining hall is in the wrong. The situation is in a college setting. So, the person's friend A comments on their friend B's style, saying he wears a suit for fun. The author then calls B a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and friend A thinks the author was an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. College is a place where people express themselves in various ways. Wearing a suit to a dining hall isn't a typical choice, but it's not against any rules unless specified. The key here is whether the author's comment was uncalled for. \n\nCalling someone a \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if someone's style is different, using such language can be seen as disrespectful. The author's friend A is offended by the comment, which suggests that the remark crossed a line. Friend A might be defending their friend, but the fact that A felt the comment was asshole-like is a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues they don't care about others' choices unless it affects them. However, making a personal attack on someone's appearance and calling them names isn't just an opinion; it's an insult. It's possible that the author was expressing frustration or disdain, but the choice of words led to a conflict with their friend.\n\nAlso, considering that the dining hall is a casual place, the author might have found the suit out of place. But personal style is subjective. What one person finds pretentious, another might admire. The author's right to their opinion exists, but expressing it in a derogatory manner affects others, especially if it upsets their friend.\n\nSo, the main issue is the use of harsh language. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact of the words caused a problem. In terms of social etiquette, it's generally better to either keep such comments to oneself or express them in a more constructive way. Since the author used a derogatory term, they might be in the wrong here. The answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
