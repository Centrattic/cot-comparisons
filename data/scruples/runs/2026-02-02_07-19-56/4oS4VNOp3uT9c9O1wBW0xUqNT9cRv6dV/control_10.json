He spots his friend B walking around and comments on how B has really good style. I notice that he was wearing a full suit and tie at the dining hall and if he just got out of an interview or formal event or whatever, to which A just says that B does it for fun. I said that B was being a showoff and kind of being a pretentious idiot. A says I was being an asshole with that comment. I don't really care about what other people do as long as it doesnt affect me, but I feel like wearing a 2 piece suit to eat at the dining hall is just unbearable and eyerolling.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called someone a \"pretentious idiot\" for wearing a suit in the dining hall is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation. The person (the author) was with a friend who pointed out another friend wearing a suit. The author then called that friend a showoff and a pretentious idiot. Their friend said they were being an asshole.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the author's comment was appropriate. Wearing a suit in a casual setting like a dining hall is a fashion choice. But does that make the person pretentious? Maybe the author feels that the suit is out of place, but everyone has different tastes. The author's friend thinks the comment was harsh. \n\nNow, the question is about right and wrong. The author might argue that they're just expressing their opinion, but using a term like \"pretentious idiot\" is pretty harsh. Even if they don't care about others' choices, calling someone that in person could be seen as rude. The friend A defended B, maybe because the comment was unkind. \n\nLegally or morally, there's no law against insulting someone's fashion, but socially, it's considered rude. The author might not be in the wrong if they're just sharing their opinion, but the way they phrased it could be offensive. The term \"pretentious idiot\" is an insult, so maybe that's crossing a line. \n\nBut then again, people have different thresholds for what's acceptable. The author didn't attack B directly, just expressed their opinion in front of a friend. However, the friend took issue with it. So, in terms of responsibility, the author's comment was judgmental and possibly hurtful. \n\nI think the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because using such a derogatory term, even if it's an opinion, is unnecessarily harsh. It's better to avoid calling someone an idiot unless they've done something truly idiotic. In this case, the person was just wearing a suit, which is a personal choice. So the author should have kept their opinion to themselves or phrased it more politely.\n"
