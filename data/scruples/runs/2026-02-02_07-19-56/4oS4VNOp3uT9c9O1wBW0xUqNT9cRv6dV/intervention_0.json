      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for calling a friend's friend a \"pretentious idiot\" because they wore a suit to the dining hall. The situation is at a college, so casual settings. The person in question, B, is wearing a full suit and tie, and the author's friend A comments that B does it for fun. The author then calls B a showoff and a pretentious idiot, and friend A is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. College students are often allowed to wear whatever they want, even if it's formal attire. The dining hall isn't a formal event, so maybe the author thinks it's out of place. However, clothing choices are generally a personal matter unless they violate specific dress codes. The key here is whether the author's comment was justified.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that B is showboating, but the friend A defends B by saying it's for fun. The author's comment is harsh, calling someone an \"idiot,\" which is a strong insult. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, using such language can come off as disrespectful. The question is whether the author overstepped by making that comment.\n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics. The author is eating with a friend, and their comment might have embarrassed the friend's other friend. The friend A is upset because the author attacked their friend. The author might have thought they were just being honest, but in social situations, public criticism can be seen as rude, especially if it's not constructive.\n\nAlso, considering that the author says they don't care about others as long as it doesn't affect them. However, making a derogatory comment about someone else's appearance, even if it's not directed at them, can still be hurtful. The line between an opinion and an insult is thin here. The author's statement is a judgment about B's intentions, which they might not know for sure. Assuming B is pretentious without knowing the reason (maybe B likes formal wear, has a personal style, or is experimenting) could be an unfair assumption.\n\nIn summary, the author made a harsh, public insult based on their own assumptions. While clothing choices are personal, the method of expressing disapproval was disrespectful. Friend A's reaction is valid because the comment was unkind. So, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
