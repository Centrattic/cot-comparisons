Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the context: Hayley announced her second pregnancy early, around 4 weeks, and later had a miscarriage. The author is conflicted because they think it's common to wait until the first trimester for announcements, especially since Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk. The author didn't voice their opinion, just feels judgmental.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are judgment vs. actual wrongdoing. The author didn't say anything to Hayley or others, so there's no direct harm. They felt happy for the pregnancy and sad about the miscarriage, so their actions (support messages) are positive. The internal judgment is the issue here.\n\nBut is internal judgment considered being in the wrong? Typically, AITA questions look at actions, not thoughts. The author isn't causing harm by their thoughts alone. However, the question is whether the author's thinking is wrong. The author isn't violating any rules, just having a thought. But they're worried about being too judgmental. \n\nThe common advice is to wait until the first trimester because of the higher risk of miscarriage. Hayley's first was high-risk, so maybe she and her husband wanted to share the news earlier, even with the risk. The author's thought is based on a common practice, but it's a personal choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for their internal feelings. They didn't act on it, and their actions (supporting Hayley) were good. The judgment here is internal and not expressed, so no actual wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
