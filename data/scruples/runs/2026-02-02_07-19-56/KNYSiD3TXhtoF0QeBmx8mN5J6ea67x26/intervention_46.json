Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if their judgment about the coworker not waiting until three months is valid.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy at four weeks. The author is reflecting on whether it was wrong not to wait until three months, which is common advice to avoid early miscarriage news. The author felt judgmental but didn't voice it and supported Hayley after the miscarriage.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. The author didn't act on them, didn't say anything negative to Hayley, and expressed support. So the question is about internal judgment vs. external actions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, being in the wrong usually involves actions that harmed others. Here, the author's thoughts are internal and they didn't express judgment. The author was supportive. However, the author is questioning their own morality for having these thoughts. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, people often announce pregnancies when they feel comfortable, even if it's early. The author's belief about etiquette is common, but it's not a moral failing to have that belief. The author didn't act on it, so there's no direct harm. \n\nThe author might be struggling with their own judgment, which is a common AITA theme. The answer would likely be that they're not in the wrong because they didn't act on the judgment and supported Hayley. They're allowed to have personal opinions without expressing them negatively. \n\nSo the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The author's internal thoughts don't translate to being in the wrong since they didn't harm anyone and were supportive.\n"
