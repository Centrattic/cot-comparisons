Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. The author's main point is that they feel judgmental about Hayley announcing her second pregnancy so early, given that the first was high-risk and the common advice is to wait until three months to avoid the risk of a miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker had a miscarriage a few weeks after announcing. The author is wondering if it's wrong to think the coworker should have waited. The question is about whether the author's judgment makes them \"in the wrong.\"\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's true that many people wait until the first trimester is over (around 12 weeks) to announce a pregnancy because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first trimester. However, every person's situation is different. The coworker might have had reasons for announcing earlier, maybe personal or cultural, or perhaps she was feeling good and excited. The author is reflecting on their own feelings of judgment here, not actually saying anything to the coworker.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is not acting on their judgment, just thinking about it. They expressed support after the miscarriage, which shows empathy. The author's concern is about their internal thoughts and whether those thoughts are wrong. \n\nIs it wrong to have that thought? Well, people can have various opinions, but being in the wrong usually involves harmful actions. The author isn't blaming Hayley, not participating in negative discussions, and is supportive. Their self-reflection is about their own judgment, not others. The question is whether the author's internal judgment makes them in the wrong. \n\nIn this scenario, it's more about the author's self-perception. They feel guilty for thinking this, but unless they acted on it in a harmful way (like criticizing Hayley), it's more about their own thoughts. Society often stigmatizes people for having critical thoughts, but unless those thoughts lead to harmful actions, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the author is concerned about being judgmental, which is a valid personal reflection. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they aren't acting on the judgment, are supportive, and are reflecting on their own feelings. The answer might be B.\n"
