Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that a coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around four weeks along. The author didn't express any negativity at the time and supported Hayley after a miscarriage, but is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking Hayley should have waited until three months to announce.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about judgment and the appropriateness of the author's thoughts versus actions. The author didn't say anything to Hayley or others, just had internal thoughts and feelings of judgment. The question is whether those thoughts make them \"the asshole.\"\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is usually on actions, not just thoughts. The author didn't act on their judgment, didn't spread rumors, and were supportive. The judgment here is internal, which is common but the question is about being in the wrong. Typically, people are allowed to have personal opinions without being in the wrong, as long as they don't act on them. \n\nHowever, the author is reflecting on whether their judgment is unwarranted. The post is seeking validation or reassurance. The main issue is whether the author's internal judgment is inappropriate. Since the author didn't harm anyone and supported Hayley, their thoughts alone don't make them the asshole. The community would likely say they're not in the wrong, but maybe should check their own biases. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author's judgment is based on an assumption that others are wrong when it's a personal choice. But unless they acted on it, it's not their fault. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
