Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker, Hayley, who announced her pregnancy early, around four weeks, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author is questioning if they're being too judgmental for thinking Hayley should have waited until three months to announce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't say anything negative to Hayley or others. They were supportive both during the announcement and after the miscarriage. The main issue is the author's internal judgment about the timing of the announcement. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, there's a common practice to wait until the first trimester is over, around 12 weeks, because the risk of miscarriage is higher before that. Hayley announced much earlier, which the author feels was too soon. However, the author isn't expressing this judgment outwardly; it's just their own thoughts.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intentions, their actions (supportive messages), and whether their thoughts constitute being in the wrong. Since they didn't act on their judgment or harm Hayley, the question is more about personal feelings versus wrongdoing. \n\nThe author is struggling with their own feelings of judgment, not causing any direct harm. The answer likely hinges on whether internal thoughts, without action, make someone \"in the wrong.\" In most cases, unless the judgment is expressed and causes harm, the person isn't in the wrong for their thoughts. However, they might be encouraged to reflect on why they feel that way, perhaps due to cultural norms or personal beliefs. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). They aren't at fault for their thoughts, especially since they acted supportively. The judgment is internal and doesn't affect Hayley directly. The community might suggest being more understanding, but the author isn't blamed for their personal feelings in this case.\n"
