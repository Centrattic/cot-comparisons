Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy after only four weeks, which the author considers too early, especially since her first pregnancy was high-risk. The author is feeling judgmental but hasn't expressed these thoughts to Hayley.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around announcing pregnancies. I know that many people announce once they're around 12 weeks pregnant because the risk of miscarriage is lower by then. The author mentions this as proper etiquette, which makes sense. However, it's also important to remember that each person's situation is different. Hayley might have had her reasons, maybe medical or personal, for announcing earlier. The author acknowledges that she was happy for her and supportive, so their intentions were good.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. The author hasn't said anything negative to Hayley and has shown support. The question is about their internal judgment. In terms of ethics, being judgmental isn't necessarily wrong if it's kept to oneself and doesn't harm the other person. The author isn't spreading rumors or criticizing Hayley publicly. They feel guilty about their thoughts but aren't acting on them.\n\nHowever, the article is asking if they're in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, judging someone's personal choices without knowing their full story can be seen as wrong. The author doesn't have all the reasons behind Hayley's decision to announce early. Maybe Hayley's first pregnancy wasn't high-risk as the author assumed, or they had a doctor's advice to share earlier. The author's judgment is based on assumptions.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is reflecting on their own behavior and trying to be less judgmental, that's a positive step. The fact that they're questioning their thoughts shows self-awareness. The problem is the judgment itself, but since it's internal and not causing harm, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe the author is being too harsh on themselves. The answer might hinge on whether internal judgment counts as being in the wrong. Since they didn't act on it and supported Hayley, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, if the question considers internal judgment as being in the wrong, then A.\n\nBut in most AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the key is whether the person did something wrong. Since the author didn't act negatively, the answer is likely B. They're not the asshole for having private thoughts, even if they feel judgmental. The real issue would be if they spread negative comments, which they didn't.\n"
