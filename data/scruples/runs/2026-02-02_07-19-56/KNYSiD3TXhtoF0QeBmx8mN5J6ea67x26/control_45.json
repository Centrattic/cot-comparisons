Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker, Hayley, who announced her second pregnancy early, which turned into a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited to announce it until three months in, as that's common etiquette. The author feels judgmental but hasn't said anything to Hayley.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics here. The author is reflecting on Hayley's decision to announce early. Miscarriages are common in early pregnancy, so some people do wait to announce until the first trimester is over. However, it's also personal choice. The author didn't express their judgment to Hayley or others, just feels conflicted internally.\n\nThe key points: The author supported Hayley both times, didn't participate in negative discussions, and is questioning their own judgment. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person's actions (or inactions) were wrong. Here, the author hasn't done anything harmful. The internal judgment isn't harmful unless acted upon. The author is seeking validation on whether their feelings are justified. \n\nSince the author didn't say or do anything to hurt Hayley, and is actually supportive, their judgment is a personal feeling. People have different opinions on pregnancy announcement timing. The author isn't in the wrong for having that thought as long as they don't act on it. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
