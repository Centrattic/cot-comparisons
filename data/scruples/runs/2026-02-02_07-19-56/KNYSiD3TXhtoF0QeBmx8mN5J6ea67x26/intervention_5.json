Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker, Hayley, announcing her second pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited to announce until three months along, as that's common etiquette to avoid the risk of early miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is reflecting on their own feelings of judgment towards Hayley for announcing the pregnancy so early, especially considering her first pregnancy was high-risk. The author didn't voice their opinion but is now questioning if they're being too judgmental. They feel bad but are unsure if they're at fault here.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, they are in the wrong) or B (no, they are not). \n\nI should consider societal norms and etiquette around announcing pregnancies. Typically, waiting until the first trimester is common because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first 12 weeks. However, people have different reasons for announcing early. Maybe Hayley wanted to share the joy immediately or her previous pregnancy's high-risk status made her anxious to share. But the author is wondering if the timing was inappropriate.\n\nThe author's judgment here is internal; they didn't express it to Hayley. They sent a message of support after the miscarriage. The author's main conflict is self-doubt about their judgment. The question is whether just having those thoughts makes them wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, unless the author acted on their judgment in a harmful way (like criticizing Hayley publicly), their internal thoughts might not make them \"in the wrong.\" However, if the author is implying that Hayley was wrong, even if not said aloud, it's a matter of personal judgment versus actual wrongdoing. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is being judgmental. The scenario says they are feeling judgmental but haven't acted on it. In that case, maybe they're not in the wrong for having those thoughts, but perhaps they should reflect on why they have those thoughts. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which usually implies a moral or ethical transgression. Since the author didn't do anything harmful, just have thoughts, they might not be in the wrong. But if the question is about the judgment itself, maybe there's a societal expectation to avoid such thoughts, but that's subjective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is correct to think that waiting is better, but their judgment is misplaced because they don't know Hayley's full situation. Hayley might have had valid reasons for announcing early. The author's judgment is based on their own understanding of etiquette, but they are overstepping by judging a personal decision without knowing all the circumstances. So the author might be in the wrong by being judgmental, even if it's internal.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. The answer could hinge on whether having the judgmental thoughts, even without acting on them, constitutes being in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because the author is being judgmental. If it's B (no), it's because they didn't act on it and are just reflecting. But the original question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they didn't do anything to harm Hayley, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the act of being judgmental itself is considered wrong in some contexts. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (no), because the author didn't act on their judgment, and their internal thoughts don't necessarily make them wrong unless they caused harm. But I'm not entirely sure. Some might argue that the judgment itself is wrong regardless of action. But in the context of the AITA genre, the focus is usually on actions, not thoughts. So the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't do anything. Therefore, answer B.\n"
