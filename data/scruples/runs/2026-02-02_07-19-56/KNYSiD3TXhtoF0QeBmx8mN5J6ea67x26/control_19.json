Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker, Hayley, who announced her pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking Hayley should have waited to announce until three months along, especially since her first pregnancy was high-risk.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is genuinely happy for Hayley and supports her, both when the pregnancy was announced and after the miscarriage. They didn't participate in any negative discussions and sent messages of support. The question is about their internal judgment\u2014thinking Hayley was inconsiderate for announcing early\u2014versus actual wrongdoing.\n\nThe author's judgment is about etiquette. They believe the common practice is to wait until the first trimester (around 12 weeks) to announce a pregnancy because the risk of miscarriage is higher before that. Hayley announced around 4 weeks, which is very early. The author feels conflicted because they're being judgmental but aren't acting on it.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the perspectives. From a social etiquette standpoint, there's a common understanding that waiting until the first trimester is safer to avoid the emotional toll of sharing the news too early if a miscarriage occurs. However, Hayley might have had her reasons for announcing earlier\u2014maybe personal, cultural, or medical. The author isn't criticizing Hayley publicly or saying anything harmful; they're just having internal thoughts.\n\nThe key here is that the author isn't acting on their judgment. They're reflecting on their feelings of being judgmental but aren't expressing it. The question is whether having those thoughts makes them in the wrong. In terms of actual wrongdoing (like hurting Hayley), the answer is no. However, the author is questioning their own judgment, which is valid. But in terms of being an \"asshole,\" they aren't because they aren't harming anyone. They're just having personal thoughts, which are common when people deal with sensitive situations. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their internal judgment doesn't translate into actual harmful actions towards Hayley.\n"
