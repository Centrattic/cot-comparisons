Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which the author thinks is too soon, and then suffering a miscarriage. The author feels conflicted about their judgment but isn't saying anything directly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The coworker announced the pregnancy when she was only four weeks along. The author's main point is that the common etiquette is to wait until three months, as early miscarriages are common. The author feels they're being judgmental for thinking that way but isn't acting on it. They were supportive both during the announcement and after the miscarriage.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that Hayley should have waited. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't acting on their judgment\u2014they're not saying anything to Hayley or criticizing her. They're reflecting on their own feelings of judgment. The author's internal conflict is about whether their judgment is valid. \n\nI need to consider if the author's judgment is unwarranted. People have different reasons for announcing pregnancies early. Maybe Hayley and her husband wanted to share the news as soon as possible, especially since their first pregnancy was high risk. They might have been cautious, but the timing is still a personal choice. \n\nThe author is aware that they're being judgmental and are trying to figure out if that's wrong. Since they're not expressing their judgment and are supportive otherwise, it's more about their internal feelings rather than any actionable wrongdoings. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, while some people do wait until the first trimester is over, others might announce earlier for various reasons. The author's belief about etiquette is valid, but applying that to judge another person's choice could be seen as judgmental. However, since they aren't acting on it, maybe they're not in the wrong for having that thought. \n\nBut is the thought itself wrong? People often have judgments, and the question is whether the author should feel guilty for that. The key here is that the author isn't harming anyone; they're just feeling judgment. The real issue is whether the judgment is justified. \n\nSince the author is being supportive in their actions and only questioning their internal thoughts, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, if the judgment is based on a misunderstanding or if the author's belief about etiquette is the standard, maybe they are correct. But since the user is asking if they are in the wrong, and they aren't acting on it, perhaps the answer is B.\n"
