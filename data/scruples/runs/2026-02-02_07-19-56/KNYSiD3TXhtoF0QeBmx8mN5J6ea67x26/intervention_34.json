Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker, Hayley, announcing her second pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author is conflicted because they think it's improper to announce a pregnancy before three months since miscarriages are common early on. They didn't say anything to Hayley but feel judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around announcing pregnancies. I know that some people do wait until the first trimester is over because the risk of miscarriage is lower after 12 weeks. However, not everyone follows this, and some choose to share earlier for various reasons. The author's coworker had a high-risk first pregnancy, which might have influenced her decision to try again quickly. Maybe she felt confident based on her medical history or circumstances.\n\nThe author is questioning if Hayley should have waited, but they didn't express this judgment directly to her. They were supportive both times. The key here is that the author is struggling with their own feelings of judgment but hasn't acted on them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking this way.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, being judgmental in thoughts alone isn't typically considered wrong unless it affects others. The author didn't criticize Hayley, didn't spread negative comments, and was supportive. They're reflecting on their own mindset. So, is it wrong to have this thought? It depends on cultural or personal beliefs, but since they aren't acting on it, maybe not. However, the question is whether they are the asshole. The \"AITA\" often depends on actions, not just thoughts. Since the author did nothing harmful, they might not be in the wrong. But if the judgment stems from a place of assuming Hayley didn't know the proper etiquette, maybe there's an implicit assumption that Hayley was careless. However, people have different reasons for announcing pregnancies early, and Hayley might have had her own valid reasons.\n\nThe author might be overthinking their own judgment. It's common after a loss to second-guess if there was something that could have been done differently, but in this case, the author isn't blaming Hayley directly. They\u2019re just thinking about the timing. Since they didn't act on their thoughts and were supportive, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the judgment is based on an assumption that Hayley was negligent in her decision, then maybe there's a subtle wrongdoing in the thought process. But generally, personal thoughts aren't considered as being in the wrong unless they lead to harmful actions. So the answer is likely B.\n"
