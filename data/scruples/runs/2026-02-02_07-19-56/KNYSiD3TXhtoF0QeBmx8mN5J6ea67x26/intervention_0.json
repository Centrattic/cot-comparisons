Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around four weeks along. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until three months to announce it, considering the risk of miscarriage, especially since her first pregnancy was high-risk. The author felt a bit judgmental but didn't say anything to Hayley and supported her after the miscarriage.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider the key points here. The author's judgment is internal; they didn't voice their opinion to Hayley or others. They were supportive before and after. The question is whether the author is wrong for having these thoughts. \n\nJudgmental thoughts are common, but the key is whether they acted on them. The author didn't express any negativity to Hayley, so there's no direct harm done. The etiquette about announcing pregnancy after 12 weeks is a common cultural norm, but people choose when to announce based on their comfort. Hayley's decision to announce early might have been personal, perhaps due to her own experiences or circumstances.\n\nThe author's internal conflict is about feeling judgmental but not acting on it. Since they didn't make Hayley feel bad or spread any negative comments, their thoughts alone don't make them the asshole. However, maybe the author should reflect on why they're so focused on this\u2014perhaps underlying biases about young parents or pregnancy decisions. But without any action, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for having these thoughts as long as they didn't act on them or harm Hayley. However, the author might benefit from examining their own biases. But in terms of the AITA framework, the action here is the internal judgment, not expressed, so not the asshole.\n"
