Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe scenario is about a coworker, Hayley, who announced her pregnancy early and then had a miscarriage. The author is feeling judgmental about Hayley announcing the pregnancy so soon, especially since the first pregnancy was high risk. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental. They want to know if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around announcing pregnancies. I remember that traditionally, people wait until the first trimester is over, which is around 12-13 weeks, because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first trimester. So Hayley announced at four weeks, which is really early. The author is thinking that maybe she should have waited. But Hayley's first pregnancy was high risk, which might be why she announced early again\u2014maybe she's anxious about the second one.\n\nThe author is happy for Hayley initially but then feels conflicted after the miscarriage. They're questioning their own judgment. The key points here are the author's internal conflict and the social etiquette of pregnancy announcements.\n\nThe author isn't saying anything to Hayley, so there's no direct harm. They're just thinking about it. The question is whether these thoughts make them in the wrong. The possible angles are judgmental thinking vs. being empathetic. The author is being supportive in action but is struggling with their thoughts. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author hasn't done anything harmful. They're just having some judgmental thoughts. People often have intrusive thoughts, especially in sensitive situations. The fact that they're reflecting on their judgment and seeking advice suggests they have empathy and care about their coworker. The problem here is more internal than external. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether internal judgment (without action) is considered being in the wrong. Since the author isn't acting on their thoughts and is actually supportive, they're not wrong for having those thoughts. Everyone has moments of judgment. The key is that they're not spreading negativity or acting on it. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
