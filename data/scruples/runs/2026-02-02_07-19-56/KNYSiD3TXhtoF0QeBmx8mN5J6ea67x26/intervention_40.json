Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy a few weeks into it (around four weeks), which is very early. The author is wondering if it was wrong not to wait until three months, which they thought was the proper etiquette. The coworker then had a miscarriage, and the author is feeling judgmental but didn't say anything.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's judgment about the timing of the announcement, the fact that the coworker had a miscarriage, and the author's feelings of being too judgmental. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts.\n\nI should consider societal norms around pregnancy announcements. Traditionally, people do wait until the first trimester is more advanced (around 12 weeks) because the risk of miscarriage is higher before that. But some people might announce earlier for various reasons\u2014maybe they wanted to share their joy sooner, or they were feeling well, or maybe their first pregnancy was high risk and they were more cautious this time. However, Hayley's first pregnancy was high risk, so maybe they were eager to share this time because they were doing better.\n\nThe author is feeling judgmental but hasn't acted on it. They were supportive both times, so their actions weren't harmful. However, the thought itself\u2014thinking the coworker made a wrong choice\u2014might be seen as judgmental. But is that enough to say the author is in the wrong?\n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to make choices about their personal life, even if others disagree. The author isn't causing harm, just thinking something. So, while it's natural to have such thoughts, the question is whether it's the author's fault for feeling that way. The author is reflecting on their judgment, recognizing that they might be too critical, and seeking validation. \n\nIn these situations, the key is intent and action. Since the author didn't act on their judgment or express it, their actions were kind and supportive. The internal conflict is about self-perception rather than actual wrongdoing. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't harm anyone, and reflecting on one's own judgments is a sign of self-awareness rather than being in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, some might argue that the author is being judgmental regardless of their actions. However, in most cases, unless the judgment is expressed or leads to harmful behavior, it's considered a personal thought. The author's support and empathy towards the coworker after the miscarriage also show that their intentions were good. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author didn't act on the judgment and was actually supportive.\n"
