Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, the situation: Hayley announced her second pregnancy early, around 4 weeks along. She later had a miscarriage. The author is wondering why she didn't wait until 3 months, which they thought was proper etiquette. They didn't say anything to Hayley but feel judgmental.\n\nSo, the key points here are about judgment and etiquette. The author isn't acting on their judgment, just thinking it. The coworker's first pregnancy was high-risk, which might add to the author's concern. However, the author made it clear they were happy for Hayley and supportive after the miscarriage. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. The answer hinges on whether the judgment is justified or if it's unreasonable. \n\nFrom a general perspective, people often announce pregnancies early, even before the first trimester. While some might suggest waiting until 12 weeks as a precaution because miscarriages are more common before then, there's no universal rule. It's a personal choice and can depend on individual circumstances. The fact that Hayley had a high-risk first pregnancy might have influenced her and her husband's decision to be more cautious, but they still chose to announce early. \n\nThe author isn't acting on their judgment, so there's no direct harm done. However, the author is feeling judgmental, which is a natural reaction but not necessarily right. The author's concern is valid in terms of wanting to avoid early announcements due to the risk of miscarriage, but it's important to recognize that others' decisions can be based on different factors (like wanting to share good news early, not knowing for sure, or personal reasons). \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author didn't express their judgment and was supportive, their thoughts alone don't make them at fault. However, the question is whether they should be in the wrong for having such thoughts. The answer would depend on societal norms around judgment. Since people have different opinions on pregnancy announcement timelines, the author's judgment isn't necessarily wrong, but it's also not justified to be critical of others for making different choices. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for their thoughts, especially since they acted supportively. The answer is B.\n"
