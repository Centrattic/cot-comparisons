Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking the coworker should have waited.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy when she was only 4 weeks along. The author is questioning why she didn't wait until 3 months, which is common etiquette to avoid the early miscarriage risk. The author felt happy initially, supported Hayley after the miscarriage, but still can't stop thinking about whether the timing of the announcement was inappropriate. The question is whether the author is at fault for these thoughts.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's internal judgment versus actual wrongdoing. The author hasn't said anything to Hayley or others, so there's no direct harm done. The judgment is internal. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted in a way that's hurtful or wrong. The author didn't express their judgment, didn't participate in negative discussions, and showed support. So, their actions (or inactions) don't seem to be harmful. The thoughts themselves are a personal reflection, not an action. Unless the author is being malicious in their thoughts, but the post says they feel like they're being too judgmental and that the idea keeps popping into their head. \n\nThe author's concern is valid because early pregnancy announcements can be risky, and it's a common etiquette to wait. However, the author isn't at fault for having these thoughts as long as they're not acting on them. The answer here would likely be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for their internal thoughts, especially since they didn't express them and supported Hayley. The judgment is more about their own feelings rather than any action taken.\n"
