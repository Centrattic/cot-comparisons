Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy a few weeks into it (around four weeks), which is very early. The author is wondering if it's wrong to think Hayley should have waited until at least three months, which is the common advice because miscarriages are more common before that. However, the author didn't voice their opinion, just thought about it. They supported Hayley both when she announced and after the miscarriage.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author's internal judgment vs. their actions. They didn't actually criticize Hayley, just had the thought. The question is whether that thought makes them in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, being judgmental in one's thoughts is different from acting on it. Society often emphasizes not judging others, but it's normal to have thoughts. The author didn't express the judgment, which is important. They were supportive in both scenarios. \n\nHowever, the author is questioning their own judgment. They feel like they might be too judgmental. The main issue is whether the act of thinking this makes them wrong. Since the author didn't harm anyone, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. The author's reasoning is based on a common practice (waiting three months). Is that a valid concern? Yes, but the author didn't act on it. The problem would arise if they shared that judgment, which they didn't. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for having the thought, just possibly being self-aware about it. \n\nAnother angle: Is it wrong to have such thoughts? People can have thoughts without being in the wrong. The real wrongdoing would be acting on them or expressing them. Since the author didn't do that, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
