Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing her second pregnancy early, then experiencing a miscarriage. The author is wondering if the coworker should have waited until three months to announce, especially since her first pregnancy was high risk. The author didn't say anything to the coworker but is feeling judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's judgment is justified. The main point is about the timing of the pregnancy announcement. The common advice is to wait until the first trimester is over, around 12 weeks, because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the early weeks. The coworker was only four weeks along when she announced it, so that's very early. The author is concerned about the etiquette here, but the coworker is the one who made the decision to announce early. \n\nThe author didn't act on their judgment or say anything negative to Hayley. They expressed support both when she announced and after the miscarriage. Their internal conflict is about whether they're being too judgmental. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking this.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person did something that's considered socially acceptable or not. Here, the author's fault isn't about their actions but their thoughts. The author isn't directly responsible for the coworker's decision. The coworker made the announcement, and the author is just having an opinion. Even though the author is judgmental, they didn't express it to Hayley. \n\nHowever, the author is questioning their own judgment. The community often looks at whether the person's actions (or in this case, thoughts) are unkind or overly critical without a valid reason. The author's concern is based on a common belief about pregnancy announcements, so maybe that's a standard they think others should follow. But Hayley's decision, while perhaps risky, was her personal choice. The author's internal judgment isn't causing harm, but the question is if they are the asshole for having that thought.\n\nI think the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the author didn't act on their judgment and their own feelings don't necessarily make them the asshole. People often have personal opinions about others' choices without expressing them. The coworker, on the other hand, made a personal decision, and while the outcome was unfortunate, the author's internal thought isn't actionable. The real issue is the outcome (miscarriage), not the announcement timing. The author is just reflecting on the situation, not blaming the coworker. So the author's judgment is their own, but they didn't do anything harmful. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
