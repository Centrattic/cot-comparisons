Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author feels that it's improper to announce before three months because of the risk of miscarriage, but they didn't say anything to the coworker. They're wondering if they're being too judgmental.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the timing of the announcement and the author's internal judgment. The author didn't express their opinion to Hayley, so there's no direct harm done. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their thoughts and feelings of judgment.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, while some people do wait until the first trimester to announce a pregnancy for practical and emotional reasons, it's not a universal rule. Each couple makes their own decision based on their circumstances. The author's belief that waiting until three months is \"proper etiquette\" might be their personal view, but there's no objective standard enforcing that. The author isn't acting on their judgment, so they aren't directly causing harm here.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty about their thoughts, which suggests they care about being judgmental. Since they didn't voice their opinion and supported Hayley both before and after the miscarriage, their actions don't align with being judgmental. The fact that they sent a message of support and were happy for her initially shows they didn't act on their internal thoughts.\n\nHowever, the author might be overthinking their own judgment. It's natural to have thoughts like this, especially if they've heard of others doing it differently. But as long as they aren't sharing their judgment, their actions are appropriate. The core issue is whether the judgment itself makes them wrong. Since judgment is a personal feeling and not an action, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having those thoughts, especially if they don't act on them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they didn't act on their judgment and showed support. Their internal thoughts don't make them at fault here.\n"
