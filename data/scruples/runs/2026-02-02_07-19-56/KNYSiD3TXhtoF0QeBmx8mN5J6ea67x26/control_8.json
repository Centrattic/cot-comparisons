Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage, and the author is wondering if their judgment is valid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy when she was only 4 weeks along. The author feels that the proper etiquette is to wait until three months, especially given that the first pregnancy was high-risk. The author didn't say anything to Hayley but is questioning their own judgment.\n\nThe main issue here is about the timing of pregnancy announcements and social norms. The author's judgment is internal; they didn't express it to Hayley, so there's no direct harm. The question is whether their thoughts make them at fault.\n\nI should consider the cultural norms around pregnancy announcements. In many places, people do wait until the first trimester is over because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first 12 weeks. The author is aware of this and is following that standard. However, others might choose to announce earlier for personal reasons. The key here is that the author is not acting on their judgment but is feeling guilty for having those thoughts.\n\nThe author also expressed support after the miscarriage, which shows they care. Their internal conflict is about being judgmental, but as long as they didn't act on it or spread negativity, they aren't in the wrong. It's about personal feelings versus actions. Since they didn't do anything harmful, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). They're allowed to have their opinion, especially if it's based on common advice, without being wrong.\n"
