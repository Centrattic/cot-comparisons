Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy until three months along. \n\nFirst, the situation: Hayley announced her second pregnancy early, but then had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if it was wrong for Hayley to announce so soon, given that the first pregnancy was high-risk. The author didn't voice any judgment but is feeling guilty for thinking it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about societal norms and judgment. The author is reflecting on whether their internal judgment is valid. In many cultures, announcing a pregnancy before the first trimester is common because the risk of miscarriage is higher then. However, some people might prefer to wait until the 12-week mark for similar reasons. The author is questioning if their own thoughts are too judgmental.\n\nThe author didn't express any of these thoughts to Hayley, which is important. They supported her after the miscarriage and didn't participate in negative discussions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. \n\nConsidering that the author's actions (congratulating, supporting after the loss) contrast with their internal thoughts, it's about internal judgment versus actual wrongdoing. Being judgmental internally isn't necessarily wrong if it doesn't affect others. The author isn't harming Hayley by thinking it, just feeling conflicted about their own thoughts. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether internal judgment counts as being \"in the wrong.\" Since the author isn't acting on it and is struggling with their feelings, the answer is likely B (they're not in the wrong), but the question is about whether their thoughts make them at fault. However, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often looks at actions, not just thoughts. The author didn't do anything to Hayley, so they aren't in the wrong for thinking it, even if the thoughts are judgmental. Hence, answer B.\n"
