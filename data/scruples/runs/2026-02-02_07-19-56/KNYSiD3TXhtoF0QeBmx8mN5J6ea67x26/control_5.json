Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. The situation is that the coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy very early, around four weeks in. Then she had a miscarriage, and the author is wondering if Hayley was too hasty in announcing, thinking that three months is the proper time.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's judgment is valid. The author didn't say anything to Hayley, just thought about it. So, the question is whether the author is being judgmental in a wrong way.\n\nPregnancy announcements are a personal choice. While it's common to wait until the first trimester is over (around 12 weeks) because the risk of miscarriage is lower, some people choose to share earlier. The author is aware that Hayley's first pregnancy was high risk, which might explain why she wanted to be cautious this time, but maybe she still decided to announce early. The author's feelings are about etiquette and the timing, not about Hayley's choices or her right to have children. \n\nThe author didn't express their judgment to Hayley, which is important. They were supportive and didn't participate in any negative whispers. The author is questioning their own judgment here. The key is whether their thoughts make them in the wrong. Since the author isn't acting on it or causing harm, just thinking, it's more about their personal feelings of guilt over being judgmental. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, there's no universal rule, and people have different preferences. The author's knowledge about common practices (three months) is correct, but Hayley's decision to announce early doesn't mean she was wrong. The author isn't the one who acted in a harmful way. The real issue is the author's internal conflict about their judgment. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're not acting on their judgment or causing harm. They\u2019re reflecting on their feelings, which is natural, but they aren't at fault for having those thoughts. The focus is on their self-reflection rather than any harmful action.\n"
