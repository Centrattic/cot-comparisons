Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, but then had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until three months to announce, given the risk of early miscarriage. They felt judgmental but didn't say anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the etiquette around announcing pregnancies. I know that traditionally, many people wait until the first trimester is over, like 12 weeks, because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first trimester. But some people do announce earlier, maybe because they want to share the news sooner, especially if they've been trying for a while or have had previous losses. \n\nIn Hayley's case, she had a high-risk first pregnancy. Maybe she and her partner decided to take a different approach this time. The author is thinking about proper etiquette but is now feeling guilty for being judgmental. They didn't voice their opinion, just had internal thoughts.\n\nThe key points are: The author is reflecting on their own judgment, not acting on it. They expressed support when needed. The question is whether being judgmental in their thoughts makes them at fault. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, unless the author acted on their judgment or spread negative comments, they might not be in the wrong. People can have thoughts without being wrong. The real issue might be if they had criticized Hayley or made her feel bad. Since they didn't, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the self-judgment they're experiencing is valid, but that doesn't mean they are \"in the wrong\" in an external sense. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they didn't act on their judgment and supported Hayley when needed. The author's internal conflict is about their own feelings, not actions that harmed others.\n"
