Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if their judgment is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy early, around four weeks. The author is thinking she should have waited until three months, which is a common practice because early miscarriages are common. The author feels conflicted because they were happy for the pregnancy but now feel judgmental after the loss.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's judgment is valid. The author didn't voice their thoughts, only thought about it. The article mentions that the author is worried about being too judgmental. \n\nNow, in terms of social norms, it's common to wait until the first trimester is over to announce a pregnancy. However, people have different reasons for announcing early. Maybe Hayley and her husband wanted to share the joy, or maybe they were confident in the pregnancy. The author's judgment is about the timing, not the fact that they conceived quickly. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for having these thoughts? Well, thinking something doesn't necessarily make you wrong. The author didn't express it to Hayley, so there's no direct harm done. The issue here is whether the judgment itself is valid. The author is questioning their own judgment, which shows self-awareness. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But maybe the author is just reflecting on their feelings without acting on them. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for having the thought, but perhaps should reflect on why they feel that way. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If being judgmental in thought is considered \"in the wrong,\" then maybe, but typically, people have thoughts without being wrong unless they act on them. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to check the nuances. The author is wondering if they are being too judgmental, which is a valid self-reflection. The key is that they didn't express it, so their actions aren't harmful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for having the thought, but they might need to manage their judgment.\n"
