Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy until three months along. The situation is that the coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy after just a few weeks, had a miscarriage, and the author is wondering if it's their fault for thinking she should have waited longer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around announcing pregnancies. I remember that many people do wait until the first trimester is over, which is around 12 weeks, because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first trimester. But is it a strict rule, or is there flexibility? The author's reasoning is based on etiquette, thinking that waiting is proper because of the risk. So, maybe the author is not wrong in their understanding of common practice here.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that the author is feeling judgmental but hasn't acted on it. They didn't express their thoughts to Hayley or others. They were supportive in both the announcement and the miscarriage. The question is whether just having the thought makes them in the wrong. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, having internal judgments without expressing harmful actions might not be considered wrong. The author isn't spreading rumors or making Hayley feel bad. They're just reflecting on their own thoughts. But maybe the author is being too harsh on themselves. It's common for people to have thoughts they later question, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. \n\nHayley might have had her reasons for announcing early. Maybe she and her husband were excited, or they had medical reasons to share earlier. The author's intention of waiting is a common concern, but others might choose to share sooner regardless. The fact that the coworker had a high-risk first pregnancy might have influenced the author's perspective, but it's not a criticism of Hayley's decision. \n\nSo, the author isn't directly causing harm here. They're struggling with their own feelings of judgment. The answer would likely be that they're not in the wrong because they didn't act on the judgment and were supportive. But maybe there's a nuance where they could be more empathetic to Hayley's situation. However, since they didn't express it, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
