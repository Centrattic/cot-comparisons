Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which then resulted in a miscarriage. The author is wondering if their judgment about the timing of the announcement is valid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker announced her pregnancy around four weeks in, which is very early. The author thinks it's more proper to wait until three months because miscarriages are common before that. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that.\n\nFrom an etiquette standpoint, it's true that many people wait until the first trimester is over because the risk is higher. However, there's no universal rule, and some people choose to share the news earlier for personal reasons. The author didn't say anything to the coworker, so their judgment is internal. They expressed support both times, so their actions were appropriate.\n\nThe author is feeling judgmental but hasn't acted on it. The problem here is whether their internal thought makes them \"in the wrong.\" Since they didn't voice their opinion or criticize the coworker, their actions don't harm anyone. The coworker made a personal choice, and while the author may have a different view, that doesn't make the author at fault for their own thoughts. \n\nThe question is about the author's judgment, not the coworker's decision. The author isn't in the wrong for having the thought, as long as they aren't spreading it or acting on it negatively. So the answer is B.\n"
