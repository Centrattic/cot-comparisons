Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage, and the author is feeling judgmental about the timing.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. Hayley announced her pregnancy after being about four weeks along. The author thinks it's better to wait until three months because of the higher risk of miscarriage in early pregnancy. The author felt happy and supportive but keeps wondering why Hayley didn't wait. The question is if the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts.\n\nNow, considering the norms around announcing pregnancies. I know that some people choose to wait until the first trimester is over because it's a time when miscarriages are more common. However, others might announce earlier, perhaps because they're excited or have medical reasons to share earlier. It's not a universal rule, so there's no one-size-fits-all answer here.\n\nThe author is experiencing internal judgment but hasn't acted on it. They didn't participate in any negative discussions and supported Hayley both times. The key point here is whether the author is in the wrong for their personal thoughts. Since judgment is a natural human reaction, especially when someone is concerned about others' well-being, but as long as they aren't expressing harmful opinions publicly, they aren't necessarily at fault.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is wrong. The author's intentions are good\u2014they wanted to be supportive and didn't spread negativity. The internal judgment isn't directed at Hayley in a harmful way. So, while they might feel guilty for their thoughts, they aren't in the wrong for having them, as everyone has personal opinions. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n\nI should check if there's any cultural or social etiquette that clearly states announcing before three months is inappropriate. If there's a common expectation to wait, then the author might not be wrong for thinking that. But if it's not a strict rule, then the author's judgment is just their opinion. Since the author didn't act on the judgment, it's more about their internal feelings rather than any action that harms others. So the answer is B.\n"
