Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. The author is struggling with their judgment and wants to know if they're being too harsh.\n\nFirst, the coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy early, around four weeks, which is before the typical three-month mark. The author is wondering if it's wrong not to have waited. The author didn't say anything negative to Hayley and was supportive, but they're feeling guilty about their private thoughts.\n\nI need to consider the cultural norms around pregnancy announcements. In many places, people do wait until the first trimester is over because the risk of miscarriage is higher before that. So the author's thought is based on common etiquette. However, people might choose to announce earlier for personal reasons\u2014maybe they wanted to share their joy, have support, or other reasons.\n\nThe author didn't act on their judgment, didn't say anything to Hayley, and was supportive. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts. The key here is that the author isn't expressing judgment outwardly. They're just reflecting on their internal feelings. \n\nIt's possible that the author is being too judgmental, but as long as they aren't acting on it or causing harm, they aren't in the wrong for having those thoughts. People have different circumstances, and the author isn't making Hayley's decision. The answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no hidden nuance. The author's thoughts are about etiquette, not about Hayley's personal choices. Since they didn't express it and were supportive, they're not the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
