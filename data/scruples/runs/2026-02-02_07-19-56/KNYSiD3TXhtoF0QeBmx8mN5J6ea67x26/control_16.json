Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker, Hayley, who announced her second pregnancy early, only to later suffer a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited until three months to announce, given that the first pregnancy was high-risk. The author is feeling judgmental but hasn't said anything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hayley announced the pregnancy a few weeks into it, which is before the three-month mark when many people wait to announce to avoid the risk of miscarriage. The author is questioning if Hayley was wrong for not waiting. But the author didn't express this judgment to Hayley, only thinking about it. \n\nNow, the key points here: Is the author in the wrong for feeling this way? Well, the author hasn't actually done anything harmful. They didn't criticize Hayley, participate in negative discussions, or make her feel bad. The author even supported Hayley after the miscarriage. The question is whether the author's thoughts make them at fault. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, there's a common practice to wait until the first trimester is over because the risk of miscarriage is higher. But each person's situation is different. Hayley's first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe they felt more confident this time. However, the author's judgment is based on their own beliefs about proper timing. \n\nThe author's main issue is internal\u2014wondering if Hayley should have waited. Since the author didn't act on those thoughts, it's more about personal judgment rather than actual wrongdoing. The author is reflecting on their own feelings of being judgmental, which is a common human experience. \n\nIn terms of accountability, unless the author's thoughts led to harmful actions, they aren't in the wrong. The author is seeking reassurance that their feelings aren't making them a bad person. The fact that they supported Hayley after the miscarriage shows they care. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author didn't do anything to harm Hayley and is actually supportive. The judgment is internal and doesn't translate into actions that make them at fault.\n"
