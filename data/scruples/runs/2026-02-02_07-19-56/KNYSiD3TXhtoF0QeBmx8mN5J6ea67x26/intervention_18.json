Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The situation is that Hayley announced her second pregnancy very early, only a few weeks in, and then had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking she should have waited until three months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they were happy for Hayley and didn't participate in any negative discussions. They also sent support after the miscarriage. So their intentions seem good. But they're questioning their own judgment about the timing of the announcement.\n\nMiscarriages are common, especially in the first trimester. It's a known fact that many pregnancies don't make it past the first 12 weeks. So maybe announcing early is risky, but it's also a personal choice. The coworkers' reactions, like the whispered discussions about getting pregnant so soon, might indicate that some people are judgmental, but the author isn't part of that.\n\nThe key here is the author's own feelings of guilt. They're not acting on their judgment, just thinking it. The question is whether they're wrong for having that thought. Since they didn't say anything to Hayley and supported her, their actions don't harm anyone. The thought itself is a personal reflection, not an action. People can have thoughts without being in the wrong, especially if they don't act on them. However, the author is struggling with their own judgment, which is common in such situations.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, there's no universal rule on when to announce a pregnancy. Some people choose to wait until the first trimester is over, others don't. It's a personal decision based on their comfort level. So Hayley's choice to announce early isn't inherently wrong. The author's judgment stems from a place of knowing the risks, but that doesn't make Hayley's decision wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for having the thought, as long as they aren't acting on it or spreading judgment.\n"
