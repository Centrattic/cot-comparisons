Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The situation is that the coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy very early (around 4 weeks), and later had a miscarriage. The author feels that the proper etiquette is to wait until three months, especially considering the first pregnancy was high risk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't say anything to Hayley or the others; they just had internal thoughts. The coworker's announcement was made at a time when it's medically more risky, and the author's concern is about the etiquette of announcing too early. But the key here is whether the author is actually in the wrong for having those thoughts, even if they didn't act on them.\n\nIn terms of judgment, it's normal for people to have thoughts, but the question is about being wrong. The author didn't criticize Hayley, didn't spread the rumors, and showed support both when she was pregnant and after the miscarriage. The fact that they didn't express their judgment publicly suggests they aren't actively harmful. However, the internal judgment might be seen as a lack of empathy or understanding of others' situations. But in many cases, people are allowed to have private thoughts without being wrong unless they acted on them. \n\nThe community often looks at whether the person did something harmful. Since the author didn't, they aren't in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), but I need to check if there's any other angle. Maybe the author is being too judgmental, but unless they acted on it, their thoughts don't make them at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
