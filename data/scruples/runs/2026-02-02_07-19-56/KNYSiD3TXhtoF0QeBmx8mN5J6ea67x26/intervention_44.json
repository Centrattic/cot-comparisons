Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a coworker, Hayley, announcing her second pregnancy early, and later suffering a miscarriage. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited to announce the pregnancy until three months along, which is a common etiquette to avoid the risk of early miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is feeling judgmental about Hayley's decision to announce early, even though they didn't express this judgment to Hayley. They were supportive both at the announcement and after the miscarriage. The question is if the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, judging someone for a personal decision, even if it's based on well-intentioned advice, can be problematic. Everyone makes choices based on their own circumstances. Hayley might have had personal reasons for announcing early, maybe she and her husband wanted to share their joy, or they felt confident based on their first pregnancy's outcome. The author's judgment, even if unspoken, could still be seen as being inconsiderate of Hayley's autonomy and choices.\n\nAlso, the author didn't act on their judgment, so there's no direct harm done. However, the internal conflict shows they're struggling with their own feelings of judgment. The key here is whether the act of having those thoughts makes them \"in the wrong.\" In AITA scenarios, being in the wrong usually refers to actions taken, not internal thoughts. The author didn't spread rumors or criticize Hayley; they just had private, unexpressed judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is questioning if their judgment is valid. They might be overthinking it, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. However, if the judgment stems from a lack of understanding or a critical attitude towards Hayley's personal life, that could be seen as being in the wrong. But since they didn't act on it, it's more about their own mindset rather than an action that harmed Hayley.\n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at whether the person did something that contributed to the problem. Here, the author is reflecting and seeking validation, not having caused any issue. So, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the question is whether their judgment is morally right, then maybe they are, but since they didn't act on it, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they didn't act on their judgment and were supportive. The internal conflict doesn't equate to being in the wrong in this context."
