Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is at fault for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy when she was only four weeks along. Then she had a miscarriage, which is pretty early. The author is wondering if they're wrong to think she should have waited until three months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they're not saying anything to Hayley, just thinking it. They were supportive both times, so their intentions seem good. But they feel guilty for having that judgmental thought. \n\nNow, what's the general etiquette around announcing pregnancies? I remember that many people suggest waiting until the first trimester is over, like around 13 weeks, because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first trimester. So the author's thought is based on common advice. But does that mean the coworker was in the wrong? Probably not. People make choices based on their own circumstances and comfort levels. Maybe Hayley and her husband felt ready to share early, especially since their first pregnancy was high risk, they might have been more cautious this time or maybe they just wanted to celebrate early.\n\nAlso, considering Hayley's background: her first pregnancy was high risk. Maybe they were more anxious or wanted support earlier. The author mentions that Hayley was \"glowing\" when they congratulated her, so she seemed happy. The author is not criticizing her publicly but feeling guilty for their own thoughts. \n\nIs it wrong to have that thought? The author isn't acting on it or expressing it, so it's more about their internal judgment. People can have thoughts without being in the wrong, as long as they don't harm others. The key here is that the author is not spreading gossip or blaming Hayley. They're just struggling with their own feelings of judgment. \n\nIn terms of fault, the question is whether the author is wrong for having that thought. Since they're not taking any negative action and are actually supportive, it's more about their personal feelings. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're not at fault for thinking that, as long as they aren't acting on it. People can have differing opinions on etiquette, but unless they're causing harm, they aren't in the wrong for their thoughts.\n"
