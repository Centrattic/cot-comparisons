Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a coworker, Hayley, who announced her second pregnancy very early, which turned into a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking Hayley should have waited until three months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't voice any opinions, just their own thoughts. They were supportive in both instances, so their actions are okay. The question is about feeling judgmental internally. \n\nThe common advice is to wait until the first trimester is over because early miscarriages are more common. But people's choices vary. Hayley might have had personal reasons to announce earlier, maybe to share the joy or seek support. The author's judgment is based on etiquette, but that's not the same as being wrong. \n\nThe key points: the author hasn't acted on their judgment, only thought about it. They didn't spread negativity or criticize Hayley. The situation is about internal feelings rather than actions. So, being in the wrong usually relates to actions, not thoughts. Also, the author is self-aware and questioning their judgment, which is a good sign. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't act on their thoughts and were genuinely supportive. The judgment is internal and doesn't affect others. So the answer is B.\n"
