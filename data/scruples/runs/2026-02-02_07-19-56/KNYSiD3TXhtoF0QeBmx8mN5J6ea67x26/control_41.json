Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking their coworker, Hayley, should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hayley announced her pregnancy when she was only four weeks along. The author's concern is that announcing before three months is too early given the risk of miscarriage, especially since her first pregnancy was high-risk. The author didn't express these thoughts to Hayley but feels guilty about their judgment.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The author didn't say anything negative to Hayley; they were supportive both at the announcement and after the miscarriage.\n2. The author is questioning their own judgment, feeling possibly too critical.\n3. The coworker group is close-knit, and others had their own quiet discussions as well.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms around pregnancy announcements, some people do wait until the first trimester is over (around 12 weeks) to reduce the risk of having to share bad news. However, others choose to share earlier for personal or cultural reasons. Hayley might have had her own reasons for announcing early, maybe wanting to share the joy sooner, or not wanting to keep it a secret. \n\nThe author's judgment is internal; they didn't act on it or express it to Hayley. The question is about whether they're in the wrong for having that thought. Since they didn't harm Hayley directly and were supportive, the judgment here is more about their internal feelings rather than actions. In AITA scenarios, the focus is often on actions affecting others. Since the author didn't act on their judgment, they're not in the wrong. Also, the author is reflecting on their judgment, which shows self-awareness. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
