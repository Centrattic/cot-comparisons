Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a coworker announcing her pregnancy early, which later resulted in a miscarriage. The author is feeling judgmental about the coworker not waiting until three months to announce, given the high risk of miscarriages in early pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coworker, Hayley, announced her pregnancy when she was only four weeks along. The author is wondering if Hayley should have waited longer. The author feels that the proper etiquette is to wait until three months, especially since Hayley's first pregnancy was high risk. The author didn't say anything to Hayley but is struggling with their own judgment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should think about social norms and etiquette around pregnancy announcements. Traditionally, many people do wait until the first trimester is over (around three months) because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first trimester. However, some people announce earlier, sometimes even before they themselves are sure. It's a personal choice, and there's no universal rule. \n\nThe author is critical of Hayley's decision but hasn't said anything to her. The author is feeling judgmental but hasn't acted on it. The coworker suffered a miscarriage, which is tragic, and the author is trying to reconcile their judgment with empathy.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, being judgmental without having said anything harmful might not make someone the \"villain,\" but it's about whether their judgment is valid. The key here is whether the author's judgment is unreasonable. Since there's no strict rule, and people have different circumstances and reasons for announcing early, the author's judgment might be considered harsh. However, the author is reflecting on their own judgment and feeling guilty, which suggests they recognize the potential for being judgmental.\n\nThe author is not directly responsible for Hayley's decision, and their judgment doesn't seem to have caused harm. The author expressed support after the miscarriage. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is reflecting on their judgment and not acting on it, but there's a case to be made for A because the author is being judgmental. However, in AITA terms, being judgmental alone isn't usually considered \"in the wrong\" unless they acted on it. Since the author is feeling guilty and not acting, it's more likely B.\n"
