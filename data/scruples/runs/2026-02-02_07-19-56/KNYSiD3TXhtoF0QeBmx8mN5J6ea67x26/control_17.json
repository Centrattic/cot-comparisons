Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited longer to announce her pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy a few weeks after conceiving, which is around four weeks along. The author is wondering if it's wrong to think Hayley should have waited until three months, which is a common cultural norm because miscarriages are more common in early pregnancy. The author didn't express any negative feelings towards Hayley, was supportive, and feels conflicted about their own judgment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points here are about judgment, empathy, and social norms. The author's feelings of judgment are internal and not expressed outwardly. They didn't spread any negative comments or criticize Hayley. They were supportive, both when Hayley announced and after the miscarriage. \n\nThe author's internal thoughts are based on a common belief that announcing a pregnancy after three months is better to avoid the pain of a possible miscarriage. But the question is whether the author is wrong for thinking that. \n\nOn one hand, people often judge others based on their own beliefs, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like pregnancy. The author might feel they're being too judgmental, but they haven't acted on it. On the other hand, everyone has their own experiences and opinions. The author's belief is rooted in a common etiquette, so their thought process isn't inherently wrong. However, the situation also involves considering Hayley's personal circumstances. Her first pregnancy was high-risk, so maybe they had reasons to announce earlier. The author might not know all the details that influenced Hayley's decision.\n\nThe author is struggling with their own judgment but hasn't acted on it. The core issue is whether it's wrong to have these thoughts. Since the author hasn't harmed anyone and is feeling remorseful, it's more about self-compassion. The answer would depend on whether internal judgment is considered wrong. In society, having personal opinions isn't wrong unless acted upon. So the author isn't in the wrong for thinking it, just maybe for feeling judgmental. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
