Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The situation is that Hayley announced her second pregnancy early, and then had a miscarriage. The author is wondering if they're too judgmental for thinking she should have waited until three months.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coworker announced pregnancy early, which is common, but the author knows that early announcements can be risky because of the higher chance of miscarriage before three months. The author is feeling judgmental but hasn't said anything to Hayley and has supported her both times. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having these thoughts.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the social norms around pregnancy announcements. In many cultures, people announce once they're around 12-14 weeks because the risk of miscarriage drops significantly. So the author's thought is based on that understanding. However, Hayley might have had personal reasons to announce earlier. The author isn't acting on their judgment, just thinking it. The problem is whether the judgment itself is wrong.\n\nThe author didn't express any negativity, didn't participate in the whispers, and supported Hayley. So the judgment is internal. The question is if having that judgment makes them in the wrong. \n\nJudging others' life choices, even silently, can be seen as insensitive, but it's also common for people to have internal judgments. The key here is whether the author's thoughts are harmful. Since they didn't act on them or harm Hayley, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the fact that the author is questioning their own judgment shows self-awareness. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is right to consider the social norm of waiting, and Hayley's decision was personal. The author isn't at fault for thinking that, but the answer depends on whether the judgment is valid. Since the author is reflecting and seeking advice, it's more about personal reflection than actual wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't acting on the judgment and is genuinely supportive. The internal thought isn't harmful, and the author is trying to understand their own feelings without hurting anyone. The key is intent and action\u2014since there's no harm done, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
