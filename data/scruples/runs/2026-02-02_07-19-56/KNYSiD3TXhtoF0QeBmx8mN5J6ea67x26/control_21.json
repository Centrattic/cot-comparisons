Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author works with Hayley, who announced her second pregnancy a few weeks ago. The author mentions that Hayley was only four weeks along when she announced it. The author's coworkers had some whispered comments about Hayley getting pregnant so quickly, especially since she's in her early to mid-twenties. The author didn't participate in those discussions and was happy for Hayley. Then, they found out that Hayley had a miscarriage. The author sent a message of support. Now, the author is wondering if they're being too judgmental for thinking Hayley should have waited until three months to announce the pregnancy, considering the risk of early miscarriage.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking that. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the social norms around announcing a pregnancy. I remember that traditionally, people wait until the first trimester is past because the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first 12 weeks. So the author's thought is based on that common advice. However, in recent years, some people might announce earlier for various reasons, like wanting to share the joy sooner or because they had a previous loss and wanted to be open about it. \n\nIn Hayley's case, she had a high-risk first pregnancy. The author might think that waiting until three months is more appropriate given the history. But the author also says they wouldn't voice this judgment and were supportive. The key here is whether the author's private thoughts make them in the wrong.\n\nThe author isn't acting on those thoughts\u2014there's no evidence they criticized Hayley or spread negativity. They were supportive and empathetic when the pregnancy was announced and after the miscarriage. Their internal judgment isn't expressed outwardly. \n\nJudging someone's private life, even silently, can be seen as being judgmental, but unless it's causing harm or expressed, it's a personal thought. The author's actions align with being supportive, so the question is if their internal thoughts are wrong. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, the author's concern is valid from a traditional standpoint. However, people have different reasons for announcing early. The author isn't in a position to judge Hayley's personal choices, especially since they have no information about why Hayley announced early. It's possible Hayley and her husband made a personal decision based on their circumstances, which the author isn't privy to.\n\nThe author's intention here is to seek validation on whether their judgment is unfounded. The answer hinges on whether internal thoughts, without action or expression, are considered wrong. Since the author isn't acting on the judgment and is being supportive, their thoughts might not make them at fault. However, the author's judgmental thoughts could stem from a place of caring, wanting to protect Hayley from potential disappointment. \n\nBut in the end, unless the author is actively harming Hayley or spreading harmful judgments, their private thoughts don't necessarily make them in the wrong. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which usually implies some form of wrongdoing. The author isn't doing anything wrong by having those thoughts, just possibly being too judgmental in their mind. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're not acting on their thoughts and are being supportive. The judgment is internal and doesn't translate to harmful actions. The author's concern is based on social norms, and while they might be too quick to judge, it doesn't make them at fault in this scenario.\n"
