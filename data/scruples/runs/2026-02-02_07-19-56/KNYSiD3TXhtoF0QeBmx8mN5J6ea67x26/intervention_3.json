Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy, given that the coworker had a miscarriage shortly after.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The coworker announced her second pregnancy early, around four weeks along. The author is wondering why she didn't wait until three months, which they consider the proper etiquette because early miscarriages are common. They didn't say anything to the coworker but are now feeling judgmental.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's judgment of the coworker's decision to announce early, the coworker's subsequent miscarriage, and the author's internal conflict about being too judgmental.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the key factors here are the author's intentions and actions. The author didn't express their judgment outwardly; they only had internal thoughts. However, they feel guilty about those thoughts. The coworker didn't announce the pregnancy with malicious intent, and the author was initially happy for her. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while some people might wait until the first trimester to reduce anxiety, it's not a strict rule. People have different preferences and circumstances. The author's judgment stems from a place of knowing about the risk of early miscarriage, especially since the coworker's first pregnancy was high-risk. But the author isn't criticizing the coworker's decision-making or health choices directly. They're just questioning the timing based on etiquette, which they believe is a common practice.\n\nHowever, the author isn't in a position to judge someone else's personal choices, especially after the coworker faced a sad outcome. The author's internal judgment might be affecting their empathy towards a coworker they care about. But since they didn't act on it or speak ill, the harm is minimal. Still, the act of judging someone else's private decisions without knowing their full context could be seen as wrong, even if it's just internal thought.\n\nBut is it wrong to have such thoughts? People often have judgments, especially in stressful situations. The author's intentions were good\u2014they supported the coworker and expressed sympathy after the miscarriage. The issue is whether holding the judgment makes them \"in the wrong.\" \n\nIn terms of morality, being judgmental is a common human flaw, but if it's not affecting others and they're not acting on it, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which in this context might relate to social etiquette and empathy. The author might be overthinking their own judgment, but since they didn't harm anyone, perhaps they're not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the author's internal judgment could be a sign of insensitivity, even if unexpressed. The fact that they're seeking reassurance suggests they feel conflicted. But ultimately, unless they acted on the judgment, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's more about personal reflection than wrongdoing towards others. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they didn't act on their judgment and showed support. However, the author's internal conflict is valid, but not necessarily making them \"in the wrong.\"\n"
