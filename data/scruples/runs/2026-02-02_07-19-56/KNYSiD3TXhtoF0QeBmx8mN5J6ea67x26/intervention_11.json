Based on the due date she gave us, she was only a handful of weeks into her pregnancy (four at most). My co-workers are much older, some with children, some without. We\u2019re a relatively close-knit group since there aren\u2019t that many of us.\n\nWe were all happy for her, although there were a few whispered discussions about her getting pregnant again rather fast at her age (her first child was born about a year ago. I did not participate in these discussions, nor did I ever give off any impression that I was anything less than ecstatic at her news. I congratulated her separately on her new pregnancy and she was fairly glowing).\n\nEarlier this week, one of our other coworkers discreetly let us know that Hayley had suffered a miscarriage, and that she and her husband were struggling heavily with the news.\n\nI immediately sent her a message of support (which she replied graciously to). \n\nBut during this whole thing, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she and her husband didn\u2019t wait until she was at least three months along to announce her pregnancy to the world, especially since her first one was high risk. I was always under the impression that that was the proper etiquette since miscarriages are unfortunately common before that timeframe.\n\nObviously I would never say anything like that to her, and I was genuinely happy for her when she announced the pregnancy and genuinely sad when I found out about the miscarriage. But the idea keeps popping into my head, and I feel like I\u2019m being too judgmental.\n\nPlease tell me - AITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for thinking their coworker should have waited to announce her pregnancy. The coworker, Hayley, announced her second pregnancy early, around four weeks along, and later had a miscarriage. The author is questioning why she didn't wait until three months, which they thought was the proper etiquette, especially given Hayley's first pregnancy was high risk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is reflecting on their thoughts and wondering if they're being too judgmental. They didn't express these thoughts to Hayley and were supportive both times. The key points here are the author's internal judgment versus actual actions. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, there's a common belief that waiting until the first trimester is safer to reduce the risk of sharing news too early if there's a miscarriage. However, people choose to announce pregnancies for various personal reasons. Hayley might have felt ready to share, even if it was early. The author is not directly blaming Hayley but is struggling with their own thoughts.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they didn't act on their judgment or express it in a harmful way, their thoughts alone don't make them responsible. However, the author is self-aware and questioning if they're being judgmental. The answer likely hinges on whether internal thoughts without harmful actions constitute being \"in the wrong.\" \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on actions affecting others. Since the author supported Hayley and didn't spread negativity, their internal thoughts might not be considered wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The author is aware of their judgment and is seeking validation. It's possible the community might see it as the author being overly critical but not necessarily in the wrong because they didn't act on it. Alternatively, some might argue that judging someone's personal choice, even internally, is wrong. But since they didn't harm, the answer is probably B.\n"
